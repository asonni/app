				"main_text": "I walk down the garden paths,<br>And all the daffodils<br>Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.<br>I walk down the patterned garden-paths<br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br>With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,<br>I too am a rare<br>Pattern. As I wander down<br>The garden paths.<br><br>My dress is richly figured,<br>And the train<br>Makes a pink and silver stain<br>On the gravel, and the thrift<br>Of the borders.<br>Just a plate of current fashion,<br>Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.<br>Not a softness anywhere about me,<br>Only whalebone and brocade.<br>And I sink on a seat in the shade<br>Of a lime tree. For my passion<br>Wars against the stiff brocade.<br>The daffodils and squills<br>Flutter in the breeze<br>As they please.<br>And I weep;<br>For the lime-tree is in blossom<br>And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.<br><br>And the plashing of waterdrops<br>In the marble fountain<br>Comes down the garden-paths.<br>The dripping never stops.<br>Underneath my stiffened gown<br>Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,<br>A basin in the midst of hedges grown<br>So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,<br>But she guesses he is near,<br>And the sliding of the water<br>Seems the stroking of a dear<br>Hand upon her.<br>What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!<br>I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.<br>All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.<br><br>I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,<br>And he would stumble after,<br>Bewildered by my laughter.<br>I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his shoes.<br>I would choose<br>To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,<br>A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,<br>Till he caught me in the shade,<br>And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,<br>Aching, melting, unafraid.<br>With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,<br>And the plopping of the waterdrops,<br>All about us in the open afternoon --<br>I am very like to swoon<br>With the weight of this brocade,For the sun sifts through the shade.<br><br>Underneath the fallen blossom<br>In my bosom,<br>Is a letter I have hid.<br>It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.<br>'Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell<br>Died in action Thursday se'nnight.'<br>As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,<br>The letters squirmed like snakes.<br>'Any answer, Madam,' said my footman.<br>'No,' I told him.<br>'See that the messenger takes some refreshment.<br>No, no answer.'<br>And I walked into the garden,<br>Up and down the patterned paths,<br>In my stiff, correct brocade.<br>The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,<br>Each one.<br>I stood upright too,<br>Held rigid to the pattern<br>By the stiffness of my gown.<br>Up and down I walked,<br>Up and down.<br><br>In a month he would have been my husband.<br>In a month, here, underneath this lime,<br>We would have broke the pattern;<br>He for me, and I for him,<br>He as Colonel, I as Lady,<br>On this shady seat.<br>He had a whim<br>That sunlight carried blessing.<br>And I answered, 'It shall be as you have said.'<br>Now he is dead.<br><br>In Summer and in Winter I shall walk<br>Up and down<br>The patterned garden-paths<br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br>The squills and daffodils<br>Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.<br>I shall go<br>Up and down,<br>In my gown.<br>Gorgeously arrayed,<br>Boned and stayed.<br>And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace<br>By each button, hook, and lace.<br>For the man who should loose me is dead,<br>Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,<br>In a pattern called a war.<br>Christ! What are patterns for?"
