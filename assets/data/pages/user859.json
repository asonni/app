Weep,<br><br> All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep<br><br> Vain memory's vision of a vanished head<br><br> As all that lives of all that once was he<br><br> Save that which lightens from his word; but we,<br><br> Who, seeing the sunset-colored waters roll,<br><br> Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea,<br><br> Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole,<br><br> And life and death but shadows of the soul.",
