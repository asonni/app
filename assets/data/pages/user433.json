				"main_text": "'Jack fell as he'd have wished,' the Mother said,<br> And folded up the letter that she'd read. <br> 'The Colonel writes so nicely.' Something broke<br> In the tired voice that quavered to a choke.<br> She half looked up. 'We mothers are so proud<br> Of our dead soldiers.' Then her face was bowed.<br><br> Quietly the Brother Officer went out.<br> He'd told the poor old dear some gallant lies<br> That she would nourish all her days, no doubt.<br> For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes<br> Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,<br> Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy.<br><br> He thought how 'Jack', cold-footed, useless swine,<br> Had panicked down the trench that night the mine<br> Went up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried <br> To get sent home, and how, at last, he died,<br> Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care <br> Except that lonely woman with white hair."
