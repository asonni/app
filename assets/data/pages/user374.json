				"main_text": "Yes. Why do we all, seeing of a soldier, bless him? Bless<br>Our redcoats, our tars? Both these being, the greater part,<br>But frail clay, nay but foul clay. Here it is: the heart,<br>Since, proud, it calls the calling manly, gives a guess<br>That, hopes that, makesbelieve, the men must be no less;<br>It fancies, feigns, deems, dears the artist after his art;<br>And fain will find as sterling all as all is smart,<br>And scarlet wear the spirit of war there express. <br><br>Mark Christ our King. He knows war, served this soldiering through;<br>He of all can handle a rope best. There he bides in bliss<br>Now, and seeing somewhere some man do all that man can do,<br>For love he leans forth, needs his neck must fall on, kiss,<br>And cry 'O Christ-done deed! So God-made-flesh does too:<br>Were I come o'er again' cries Christ 'it should be this'."}
