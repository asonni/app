	"main_text":"The sea is calm to-night.<br><br> The tide is full, the moon lies fair<br><br> Upon the straits; on the French coast the light<br><br> Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand;<br><br> Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.<br><br> Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!<br><br> Only, from the long line of spray<br><br> Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,<br><br> Listen! you hear the grating roar<br><br> Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,<br><br> At their return, up the high strand,<br><br> Begin, and cease, and then again begin,<br><br> With tremulous cadence slow, and bring<br><br> The eternal note of sadness in.<br><br><br><br> Sophocles long ago<br><br> Heard it on the A gaean, and it brought<br><br> Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow<br><br> Of human misery; we<br><br> Find also in the sound a thought,<br><br> Hearing it by this distant northern sea.<br><br><br><br> The Sea of Faith<br><br> Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore<br><br> Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.<br><br> But now I only hear<br><br> Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,<br><br> Retreating, to the breath<br><br> Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br><br> And naked shingles of the world.<br><br><br><br> Ah, love, let us be true<br><br> To one another! for the world, which seems<br><br> To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br><br> So various, so beautiful, so new,<br><br> Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br><br> Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;<br><br> And we are here as on a darkling plain<br><br> Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br><br> Where ignorant armies clash by night.",
