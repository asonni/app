But be his<br><br> My special thanks, whose even-balanced soul,<br> From first youth tested up to extreme old age,<br> Business could not make dull, nor passion wild;<br><br> Who saw life steadily, and saw it whole;<br> The mellow glory of the Attic stage,<br> Singer of sweet Colonus, and its child."
