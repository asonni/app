In a pig's arse, friend.<br>Day comes to an end.<br>The gas fire breathes, the trees are darkly swayed.<br>And so Dear Warlock-Williams: I'm afraid -<br><br>Funny how hard it is to be alone.<br>I could spend half my evenings, if I wanted,<br>Holding a glass of washing sherry, canted<br>Over to catch the drivel of some bitch<br>Who's read nothing but Which;<br>Just think of all the spare time that has flown<br><br>Straight into nothingness by being filled<br>With forks and faces, rather than repaid<br>Under a lamp, hearing the noise of wind,<br>And looking out to see the moon thinned<br>To an air-sharpened blade.<br>A life, and yet how sternly it's instilled<br><br>All solitude is selfish. No one now<br>Believes the hermit with his gown and dish<br>Talking to God (who's gone too); the big wish<br>Is to have people nice to you, which means<br>Doing it back somehow.<br>Virtue is social. Are, then, these routines<br><br>Playing at goodness, like going to church?<br>Something that bores us, something we don't do well<br>(Asking that ass about his fool research)<br>But try to feel, because, however crudely,<br>It shows us what should be?<br>Too subtle, that. Too decent, too. Oh hell,<br><br>Only the young can be alone freely.<br>The time is shorter now for company,<br>And sitting by a lamp more often brings<br>Not peace, but other things.<br>Beyond the light stand failure and remorse<br>Whispering Dear Warlock-Williams: Why, of course -</p><br>Coming up England by a different line<br>For once, early in the cold new year,<br>We stopped, and, watching men with number plates<br>Sprint down the platform to familiar gates,<br>‘Why, Coventry!’ I exclaimed. ‘I was born here.’<br><br>I leant far out, and squinnied for a sign<br>That this was still the town that had been 'mine'<br>So long, but found I wasn't even clear<br>Which side was which. From where those cycle-crates<br>Were standing, had we annually departed<br><br>For all those family hols? . . . A whistle went:<br>Things moved. I sat back, staring at my boots.<br>'Was that,' my friend smiled, 'where you ‘have your roots’?'<br>No, only where my childhood was unspent,<br>I wanted to retort, just where I started:<br><br>By now I've got the whole place clearly charted.<br>Our garden, first: where I did not invent<br>Blinding theologies of flowers and fruits,<br>And wasn't spoken to by an old hat.<br>And here we have that splendid family<br><br>I never ran to when I got depressed,<br>The boys all biceps and the girls all chest,<br>Their comic Ford, their farm where I could be<br>'Really myself'. I'll show you, come to that, <br>The bracken where I never trembling sat,<br><br>Determined to go through with it; where she<br>Lay back, and 'all became a burning mist'.<br>And, in those offices, my doggerel<br>Was not set up in blunt ten-point, nor read<br>By a distinguished cousin of the mayor,<br><br>Who didn't call and tell my father There<br>Before us, had we the gift to see ahead -<br>'You look as though you wished the place in Hell,'<br>My friend said, 'judging from your face.' 'Oh well,<br>I suppose it's not the place's fault,' I said.<br><br>'Nothing, like something, happens anywhere.'</p><br>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.<br>They may not mean to, but they do.<br>They fill you with the faults they had<br>And add some extra, just for you.<br><br>But they were fucked up in their turn<br>By fools in old-style hats and coats,<br>Who half the time were soppy-stern<br>And half at one another's throats.<br><br>Man hands on misery to man.<br>It deepens like a coastal shelf.<br>Get out as early as you can,<br>And don't have any kids yourself.</p><br>When I see a couple of kids<br>And guess he's fucking her and she's<br>Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,<br>I know this is paradise<br><br>Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives--<br>Bonds and gestures pushed to one side<br>Like an outdated combine harvester,<br>And everyone young going down the long slide<br><br>To happiness, endlessly. I wonder if<br>Anyone looked at me, forty years back,<br>And thought, That'll be the life;<br>No God any more, or sweating in the dark<br><br>About hell and that, or having to hide<br>What you think of the priest. He<br>And his lot will all go down the long slide<br>Like free bloody birds. And immediately<br><br>Rather than words comes the thought of high windows:<br>The sun-comprehending glass,<br>And beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows<br>Nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless.</p>"}
