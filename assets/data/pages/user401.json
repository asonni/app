				"main_text": "Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days,<br> Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,<br> And marching single in an endless file,<br> Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.<br> To each they offer gifts after his will,<br> Bread, kingdoms, stars, and sky that holds them all.<br> I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,<br> Forgot my morning wishes, hastily<br> Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day<br> Turned and departed silent. I, too late,<br> Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn."
