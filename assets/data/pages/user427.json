				"main_text": "I sat all morning in the college sick bay<br> Counting bells knelling classes to a close.<br> At two o'clock our neighbors drove me home.<br><br> In the porch I met my father crying--<br> He had always taken funerals in his stride--<br> And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.<br><br> The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram<br> When I came in, and I was embarrassed<br> By old men standing up to shake my hand<br><br> And tell me they were 'sorry for my trouble,'<br> Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest,<br> Away at school, as my mother held my hand<br><br> In hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.<br> At ten o'clock the ambulance arrived<br> With the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.<br><br> Next morning I went up into the room. Snowdrops<br> And candles soothed the bedside; I saw him<br> For the first time in six weeks. Paler now,<br><br> Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,<br> He lay in the four foot box as in his cot.<br> No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.<br><br> A four foot box, a foot for every year."
