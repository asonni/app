The young<br> In one another's arms, birds in the trees<br> - Those dying generations - at their song,<br> The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,<br> Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br> Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br> Caught in that sensual music all neglect<br> Monuments of unageing intellect.<br> <br> An aged man is but a paltry thing,<br> A tattered coat upon a stick, unless<br> Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing<br> For every tatter in its mortal dress,<br> Nor is there singing school but studying<br> Monuments of its own magnificence;<br> And therefore I have sailed the seas and come<br> To the holy city of Byzantium.<br> <br> O sages standing in God's holy fire<br> As in the gold mosaic of a wall,<br> Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,<br> And be the singing-masters of my soul.<br> Consume my heart away; sick with desire<br> And fastened to a dying animal<br> It knows not what it is; and gather me<br> Into the artifice of eternity.<br> <br> Once out of nature I shall never take<br> My bodily form from any natural thing,<br> But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make<br> Of hammered gold and gold enamelling<br> To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;<br> Or set upon a golden bough to sing<br> To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br> Of what is past, or passing, or to come."
