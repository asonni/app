I thank you for good will,<br><br>Believe, but leave that truth untested still.<br><br><br><br>Spring's and expansive time: yet I don't trust<br><br>March with its peck of dust,<br><br>Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,<br><br>Nor even May, whose flowers<br><br>One frost may wither thro' the sunless hours.<br><br>Perhaps some languid summer day,<br><br>When drowsy birds sing less and less,<br><br>And golden fruit is ripening to excess,<br><br>If there's not too much sun nor too much cloud,<br><br>And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,<br><br>Perhaps my secret I may say,<br><br>Or you may guess.",
