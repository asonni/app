				"main_text": "The last year's leaves are on the beech:<br> The twigs are black; the cold is dry;<br> To deeps byond the deepest reach<br> The Easter bells enlarge the sky.<br> O ordered metal clatter-clang!<br> Is yours the song the angels sang?<br> You fill my heart with joy and grief -<br> Belief! Belief! And unbelief...<br> And, though you tell me I shall die,<br> You say not how or when or why.<br><br> Indifferent the finches sing,<br> Unheeding roll the lorries past:<br> What misery will this year bring<br> Now spring is in the air at last?<br> For, sure as blackthorn bursts to snow,<br> Cancer in some of us will grow,<br> The tasteful crematorium door<br> Shuts out for some the furnace roar;<br> But church-bells open on the blast<br> Our loneliness, so long and vast."
