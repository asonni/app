In a pig's arse, friend.<br>Day comes to an end.<br>The gas fire breathes, the trees are darkly swayed.<br>And so Dear Warlock-Williams: I'm afraid -<br><br>Funny how hard it is to be alone.<br>I could spend half my evenings, if I wanted,<br>Holding a glass of washing sherry, canted<br>Over to catch the drivel of some bitch<br>Who's read nothing but Which;<br>Just think of all the spare time that has flown<br><br>Straight into nothingness by being filled<br>With forks and faces, rather than repaid<br>Under a lamp, hearing the noise of wind,<br>And looking out to see the moon thinned<br>To an air-sharpened blade.<br>A life, and yet how sternly it's instilled<br><br>All solitude is selfish. No one now<br>Believes the hermit with his gown and dish<br>Talking to God (who's gone too); the big wish<br>Is to have people nice to you, which means<br>Doing it back somehow.<br>Virtue is social. Are, then, these routines<br><br>Playing at goodness, like going to church?<br>Something that bores us, something we don't do well<br>(Asking that ass about his fool research)<br>But try to feel, because, however crudely,<br>It shows us what should be?<br>Too subtle, that. Too decent, too. Oh hell,<br><br>Only the young can be alone freely.<br>The time is shorter now for company,<br>And sitting by a lamp more often brings<br>Not peace, but other things.<br>Beyond the light stand failure and remorse<br>Whispering Dear Warlock-Williams: Why, of course -</p><br>There be none of Beauty's daughters<br>With a magic like Thee;<br>And like music on the waters<br>Is thy sweet voice to me:<br>When, as if its sound were causing<br>The charmйd ocean's pausing,<br>The waves lie still and gleaming,<br>And the lull'd winds seem dreaming:<br>And the midnight moon is weaving<br>Her bright chain o'er the deep,<br>Whose breast is gently heaving<br>As an infant's asleep:<br>So the spirit bows before thee<br>To listen and adore thee;<br>With a full but soft emotion,<br>Like the swell of Summer's ocean.</p><br>Drunk as drunk on turpentine<br>From your open kisses,<br>Your wet body wedged<br>Between my wet body and the strake<br>Of our boat that is made of flowers,<br>Feasted, we guide it - our fingers<br>Like tallows adorned with yellow metal -<br>Over the sky's hot rim,<br>The day's last breath in our sails.<br><br>Pinned by the sun between solstice<br>And equinox, drowsy and tangled together<br>We drifted for months and woke<br>With the bitter taste of land on our lips,<br>Eyelids all sticky, and we longed for lime<br>And the sound of a rope<br>Lowering a bucket down its well. Then,<br>We came by night to the Fortunate Isles,<br>And lay like fish<br>Under the net of our kisses.</p><br>Some say love's a little boy,<br>And some say it's a bird,<br>Some say it makes the world go around,<br>Some say that's absurd,<br>And when I asked the man next-door,<br>Who looked as if he knew, <br>His wife got very cross indeed,<br>And said it wouldn't do.<br><br>Does it look like a pair of pyjamas, <br>Or the ham in a temperance hotel?<br>Does its odour remind one of llamas,<br>Or has it a comforting smell?<br>Is it prickly to touch as a hedge is,<br>Or soft as eiderdown fluff?<br>Is it sharp or quite smooth at the edges?<br>O tell me the truth about love.<br><br>Our history books refer to it<br>In cryptic little notes,<br>It's quite a common topic on<br>The Transatlantic boats;<br>I've found the subject mentioned in<br>Accounts of suicides,<br>And even seen it scribbled on<br>The backs of railway guides.<br><br>Does it howl like a hungry Alsatian,<br>Or boom like a military band?<br>Could one give a first-rate imitation<br>On a saw or a Steinway Grand?<br>Is its singing at parties a riot?<br>Does it only like Classical stuff?<br>Will it stop when one wants to be quiet?<br>O tell me the truth about love.<br><br>I looked inside the summer-house;<br>It wasn't over there;<br>I tried the Thames at Maidenhead,<br>And Brighton's bracing air.<br>I don't know what the blackbird sang,<br>Or what the tulip said; <br>But it wasn't in the chicken-run,<br>Or underneath the bed.<br><br>Can it pull extraordinary faces?<br>Is it usually sick on a swing?<br>Does it spend all its time at the races,<br>or fiddling with pieces of string?<br>Has it views of its own about money?<br>Does it think Patriotism enough?<br>Are its stories vulgar but funny?<br>O tell me the truth about love.<br><br>When it comes, will it come without warning<br>Just as I'm picking my nose?<br>Will it knock on my door in the morning,<br>Or tread in the bus on my toes?<br>Will it come like a change in the weather?<br>Will its greeting be courteous or rough?<br>Will it alter my life altogether?<br>O tell me the truth about love.</p><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br><br>Write, for example, 'The night is starry<br>and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'<br><br>The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br><br>Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.<br>I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br><br>She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.<br>How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.<br><br>To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.<br>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br><br>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br>The night is starry and she is not with me.<br><br>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br>My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br>My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br><br>The same night whitening the same trees.<br>We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.<br>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.<br><br>Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.<br>Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br>Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br><br>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br>my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br>and these the last verses that I write for her.</p><br>When we two parted<br>In silence and tears,<br>Half broken-hearted,<br>To sever for years,<br>Pale grew thy cheek and cold,<br>Colder thy kiss;<br>Truly that hour foretold<br>Sorrow to this.<br><br>The dew of the morning<br>Sank chill on my brow—<br>It felt like the warning<br>Of what I feel now.<br>Thy vows are all broken,<br>And light is thy fame:<br>I hear thy name spoken,<br>And share in its shame.<br><br>They name thee before me,<br>A knell to mine ear;<br>A shudder comes o'er me— <br>Why wert thou so dear?<br>They know not I knew thee,<br>Who knew thee too well:— <br>Long, long shall I rue thee<br>Too deeply to tell.<br><br>In secret we met— <br>In silence I grieve<br>That thy heart could forget,<br>Thy spirit deceive.<br>If I should meet thee<br>After long years,<br>How should I greet thee?—<br>With silence and tears.</p><br>I want you to know<br>one thing.<br><br>You know how this is:<br>if I look<br>at the crystal moon, at the red branch<br>of the slow autumn at my window,<br>if I touch<br>near the fire<br>the impalpable ash<br>or the wrinkled body of the log,<br>everything carries me to you,<br>as if everything that exists,<br>aromas, light, metals,<br>were little boats<br>that sail<br>toward those isles of yours that wait for me.<br><br>Well, now,<br>if little by little you stop loving me<br>I shall stop loving you little by little.<br><br>If suddenly<br>you forget me<br>do not look for me,<br>for I shall already have forgotten you.<br><br>If you think it long and mad,<br>the wind of banners<br>that passes through my life,<br>and you decide<br>to leave me at the shore<br>of the heart where I have roots,<br>remember<br>that on that day,<br>at that hour,<br>I shall lift my arms<br>and my roots will set off<br>to seek another land.<br><br>But<br>if each day,<br>each hour,<br>you feel that you are destined for me<br>with implacable sweetness,<br>if each day a flower<br>climbs up to your lips to seek me,<br>ah my love, ah my own,<br>in me all that fire is repeated,<br>in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,<br>my love feeds on your love, beloved,<br>and as long as you live it will be in your arms<br>without leaving mine</p><br>He loved her and she loved him<br>His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to<br>He had no other appetite<br>She bit him she gnawed him she sucked<br>She wanted him complete inside her<br>Safe and Sure forever and ever<br>Their little cries fluttered into the curtains<br><br>Her eyes wanted nothing to get away<br>Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows<br>He gripped her hard so that life<br>Should not drag her from that moment<br>He wanted all future to cease<br>He wanted to topple with his arms round her<br>Or everlasting or whatever there was<br>Her embrace was an immense press<br>To print him into her bones<br>His smiles were the garrets of a fairy place<br>Where the real world would never come<br><br>Her smiles were spider bites<br>So he would lie still till she felt hungry<br>His word were occupying armies<br>Her laughs were an assasin's attempts<br>His looks were bullets daggers of revenge<br>Her glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets<br>His whispers were whips and jackboots<br>Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing<br>His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway<br>Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks<br>And their deep cries crawled over the floors<br>Like an animal dragging a great trap<br>His promises were the surgeon's gag<br>Her promises took the top off his skull<br>She would get a brooch made of it<br>His vows pulled out all her sinews<br>He showed her how to make a love-knot<br>At the back of her secret drawer<br>Their screams stuck in the wall<br>Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves<br>Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop<br><br>In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs<br>In their dreams their brains took each other hostage<br><br>In the morning they wore each other's face</p><br>I walk down the garden paths,<br>And all the daffodils<br>Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.<br>I walk down the patterned garden-paths<br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br>With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,<br>I too am a rare<br>Pattern. As I wander down<br>The garden paths.<br><br>My dress is richly figured,<br>And the train<br>Makes a pink and silver stain<br>On the gravel, and the thrift<br>Of the borders.<br>Just a plate of current fashion,<br>Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.<br>Not a softness anywhere about me,<br>Only whalebone and brocade.<br>And I sink on a seat in the shade<br>Of a lime tree. For my passion<br>Wars against the stiff brocade.<br>The daffodils and squills<br>Flutter in the breeze<br>As they please.<br>And I weep;<br>For the lime-tree is in blossom<br>And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.<br><br>And the plashing of waterdrops<br>In the marble fountain<br>Comes down the garden-paths.<br>The dripping never stops.<br>Underneath my stiffened gown<br>Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,<br>A basin in the midst of hedges grown<br>So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,<br>But she guesses he is near,<br>And the sliding of the water<br>Seems the stroking of a dear<br>Hand upon her.<br>What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!<br>I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.<br>All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.<br><br>I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,<br>And he would stumble after,<br>Bewildered by my laughter.<br>I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his shoes.<br>I would choose<br>To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,<br>A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,<br>Till he caught me in the shade,<br>And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,<br>Aching, melting, unafraid.<br>With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,<br>And the plopping of the waterdrops,<br>All about us in the open afternoon --<br>I am very like to swoon<br>With the weight of this brocade,For the sun sifts through the shade.<br><br>Underneath the fallen blossom<br>In my bosom,<br>Is a letter I have hid.<br>It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.<br>‘Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell<br>Died in action Thursday se'nnight.’<br>As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,<br>The letters squirmed like snakes.<br>‘Any answer, Madam,’ said my footman.<br>‘No,’ I told him.<br>‘See that the messenger takes some refreshment.<br>No, no answer.’<br>And I walked into the garden,<br>Up and down the patterned paths,<br>In my stiff, correct brocade.<br>The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,<br>Each one.<br>I stood upright too,<br>Held rigid to the pattern<br>By the stiffness of my gown.<br>Up and down I walked,<br>Up and down.<br><br>In a month he would have been my husband.<br>In a month, here, underneath this lime,<br>We would have broke the pattern;<br>He for me, and I for him,<br>He as Colonel, I as Lady,<br>On this shady seat.<br>He had a whim<br>That sunlight carried blessing.<br>And I answered, ‘It shall be as you have said.’<br>Now he is dead.<br><br>In Summer and in Winter I shall walk<br>Up and down<br>The patterned garden-paths<br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br>The squills and daffodils<br>Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.<br>I shall go<br>Up and down,<br>In my gown.<br>Gorgeously arrayed,<br>Boned and stayed.<br>And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace<br>By each button, hook, and lace.<br>For the man who should loose me is dead,<br>Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,<br>In a pattern called a war.<br>Christ!
