	"main_text":"I walk down the garden paths,<br><br>And all the daffodils<br><br>Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.<br><br>I walk down the patterned garden-paths<br><br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br><br>With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,<br><br>I too am a rare<br><br>Pattern. As I wander down<br><br>The garden paths.<br><br><br><br>My dress is richly figured,<br><br>And the train<br><br>Makes a pink and silver stain<br><br>On the gravel, and the thrift<br><br>Of the borders.<br><br>Just a plate of current fashion,<br><br>Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.<br><br>Not a softness anywhere about me,<br><br>Only whalebone and brocade.<br><br>And I sink on a seat in the shade<br><br>Of a lime tree. For my passion<br><br>Wars against the stiff brocade.<br><br>The daffodils and squills<br><br>Flutter in the breeze<br><br>As they please.<br><br>And I weep;<br><br>For the lime-tree is in blossom<br><br>And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.<br><br><br><br>And the plashing of waterdrops<br><br>In the marble fountain<br><br>Comes down the garden-paths.<br><br>The dripping never stops.<br><br>Underneath my stiffened gown<br><br>Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,<br><br>A basin in the midst of hedges grown<br><br>So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,<br><br>But she guesses he is near,<br><br>And the sliding of the water<br><br>Seems the stroking of a dear<br><br>Hand upon her.<br><br>What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!<br><br>I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.<br><br>All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.<br><br><br><br>I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,<br><br>And he would stumble after,<br><br>Bewildered by my laughter.<br><br>I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his shoes.<br><br>I would choose<br><br>To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,<br><br>A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,<br><br>Till he caught me in the shade,<br><br>And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,<br><br>Aching, melting, unafraid.<br><br>With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,<br><br>And the plopping of the waterdrops,<br><br>All about us in the open afternoon --<br><br>I am very like to swoon<br><br>With the weight of this brocade,For the sun sifts through the shade.<br><br><br><br>Underneath the fallen blossom<br><br>In my bosom,<br><br>Is a letter I have hid.<br><br>It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.<br><br>'Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell<br><br>Died in action Thursday se'nnight.'<br><br>As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,<br><br>The letters squirmed like snakes.<br><br>'Any answer, Madam,' said my footman.<br><br>'No,' I told him.<br><br>'See that the messenger takes some refreshment.<br><br>No, no answer.'<br><br>And I walked into the garden,<br><br>Up and down the patterned paths,<br><br>In my stiff, correct brocade.<br><br>The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,<br><br>Each one.<br><br>I stood upright too,<br><br>Held rigid to the pattern<br><br>By the stiffness of my gown.<br><br>Up and down I walked,<br><br>Up and down.<br><br><br><br>In a month he would have been my husband.<br><br>In a month, here, underneath this lime,<br><br>We would have broke the pattern;<br><br>He for me, and I for him,<br><br>He as Colonel, I as Lady,<br><br>On this shady seat.<br><br>He had a whim<br><br>That sunlight carried blessing.<br><br>And I answered, 'It shall be as you have said.'<br><br>Now he is dead.<br><br><br><br>In Summer and in Winter I shall walk<br><br>Up and down<br><br>The patterned garden-paths<br><br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br><br>The squills and daffodils<br><br>Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.<br><br>I shall go<br><br>Up and down,<br><br>In my gown.<br><br>Gorgeously arrayed,<br><br>Boned and stayed.<br><br>And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace<br><br>By each button, hook, and lace.<br><br>For the man who should loose me is dead,<br><br>Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,<br><br>In a pattern called a war.<br><br>Christ!
