Lawrence","exclude_from_menu":"true","image":"Murat Tasiroglu.jpg","main_text":"I<br> <br> The small locomotive engine, Number 4, came clanking, stumbling down from Selston — with seven full waggons. It appeared round the corner with loud threats of speed, but the colt that it startled from among the gorse, which still flickered indistinctly in the raw afternoon, outdistanced it at a canter. A woman, walking up the railway line to Underwood, drew back into the hedge, held her basket aside, and watched the footplate of the engine advancing. The trucks thumped heavily past, one by one, with slow inevitable movement, as she stood insignificantly trapped between the jolting black waggons and the hedge; then they curved away towards the coppice where the withered oak leaves dropped noiselessly, while the birds, pulling at the scarlet hips beside the track, made off into the dusk that had already crept into the spinney. In the open, the smoke from the engine sank and cleaved to the rough grass. The fields were dreary and forsaken, and in the marshy strip that led to the whimsey, a reedy pit-pond, the fowls had already abandoned their run among the alders, to roost in the tarred fowl-house. The pit-bank loomed up beyond the pond, flames like red sores licking its ashy sides, in the afternoon’s stagnant light. Just beyond rose the tapering chimneys and the clumsy black head-stocks of Brinsley Colliery. The two wheels were spinning fast up against the sky, and the winding-engine rapped out its little spasms. The miners were being turned up.<br> The engine whistled as it came into the wide bay of railway lines beside the colliery, where rows of trucks stood in harbour.<br> Miners, single, trailing and in groups, passed like shadows diverging home. At the edge of the ribbed level of sidings squat a low cottage, three steps down from the cinder track. A large bony vine clutched at the house, as if to claw down the tiled roof. Round the bricked yard grew a few wintry primroses. Beyond, the long garden sloped down to a bush-covered brook course. There were some twiggy apple trees, winter-crack trees, and ragged cabbages. Beside the path hung dishevelled pink chrysanthemums, like pink cloths hung on bushes. A woman came stooping out of the felt-covered fowl-house, half-way down the garden. She closed and padlocked the door, then drew herself erect, having brushed some bits from her white apron.<br> She was a till woman of imperious mien, handsome, with definite black eyebrows. Her smooth black hair was parted exactly. For a few moments she stood steadily watching the miners as they passed along the railway: then she turned towards the brook course. Her face was calm and set, her mouth was closed with disillusionment. After a moment she called:<br> ‘John!’ There was no answer. She waited, and then said distinctly:<br> ‘Where are you?’<br> ‘Here!’ replied a child’s sulky voice from among the bushes. The woman looked piercingly through the dusk.<br> ‘Are you at that brook?’ she asked sternly.<br> For answer the child showed himself before the raspberry-canes that rose like whips. He was a small, sturdy boy of five. He stood quite still, defiantly.<br> ‘Oh!’ said the mother, conciliated. ‘I thought you were down at that wet brook — and you remember what I told you —’<br> The boy did not move or answer.<br> ‘Come, come on in,’ she said more gently, ‘it’s getting dark. There’s your grandfather’s engine coming down the line!’<br> The lad advanced slowly, with resentful, taciturn movement. He was dressed in trousers and waistcoat of cloth that was too thick and hard for the size of the garments. They were evidently cut down from a man’s clothes.<br> As they went slowly towards the house he tore at the ragged wisps of chrysanthemums and dropped the petals in handfuls along the path.<br> ‘Don’t do that — it does look nasty,’ said his mother. He refrained, and she, suddenly pitiful, broke off a twig with three or four wan flowers and held them against her face. When mother and son reached the yard her hand hesitated, and instead of laying the flower aside, she pushed it in her apron-band. The mother and son stood at the foot of the three steps looking across the bay of lines at the passing home of the miners. The trundle of the small train was imminent. Suddenly the engine loomed past the house and came to a stop opposite the gate.<br> The engine-driver, a short man with round grey beard, leaned out of the cab high above the woman.<br> ‘Have you got a cup of tea?’ he said in a cheery, hearty fashion.<br> It was her father. She went in, saying she would mash. Directly, she returned.<br> ‘I didn’t come to see you on Sunday,’ began the little grey-bearded man.<br> ‘I didn’t expect you,’ said his daughter.<br> The engine-driver winced; then, reassuming his cheery, airy manner, he said:<br> ‘Oh, have you heard then? Well, and what do you think —?’<br> ‘I think it is soon enough,’ she replied.<br> At her brief censure the little man made an impatient gesture, and said coaxingly, yet with dangerous coldness:<br> ‘Well, what’s a man to do? It’s no sort of life for a man of my years, to sit at my own hearth like a stranger. And if I’m going to marry again it may as well be soon as late — what does it matter to anybody?’<br> The woman did not reply, but turned and went into the house. The man in the engine-cab stood assertive, till she returned with a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter on a plate. She went up the steps and stood near the footplate of the hissing engine.<br> ‘You needn’t ‘a’ brought me bread an’ butter,’ said her father. ‘But a cup of tea’— he sipped appreciatively —’it’s very nice.’ He sipped for a moment or two, then: ‘I hear as Walter’s got another bout on,’ he said.<br> ‘When hasn’t he?’ said the woman bitterly.<br> ‘I heered tell of him in the ‘Lord Nelson’ braggin’ as he was going to spend that b —— afore he went: half a sovereign that was.’<br> ‘When?’ asked the woman.<br> ‘A’ Sat’day night — I know that’s true.’<br> ‘Very likely,’ she laughed bitterly. ‘He gives me twenty-three shillings.’<br> ‘Aye, it’s a nice thing, when a man can do nothing with his money but make a beast of himself!’ said the grey-whiskered man. The woman turned her head away. Her father swallowed the last of his tea and handed her the cup.<br> ‘Aye,’ he sighed, wiping his mouth. ‘It’s a settler, it is —’<br> He put his hand on the lever. The little engine strained and groaned, and the train rumbled towards the crossing. The woman again looked across the metals. Darkness was settling over the spaces of the railway and trucks: the miners, in grey sombre groups, were still passing home. The winding-engine pulsed hurriedly, with brief pauses. Elizabeth Bates looked at the dreary flow of men, then she went indoors. Her husband did not come.<br> The kitchen was small and full of firelight; red coals piled glowing up the chimney mouth. All the life of the room seemed in the white, warm hearth and the steel fender reflecting the red fire. The cloth was laid for tea; cups glinted in the shadows. At the back, where the lowest stairs protruded into the room, the boy sat struggling with a knife and a piece of whitewood. He was almost hidden in the shadow. It was half-past four. They had but to await the father’s coming to begin tea. As the mother watched her son’s sullen little struggle with the wood, she saw herself in his silence and pertinacity; she saw the father in her child’s indifference to all but himself. She seemed to be occupied by her husband. He had probably gone past his home, slunk past his own door, to drink before he came in, while his dinner spoiled and wasted in waiting. She glanced at the clock, then took the potatoes to strain them in the yard. The garden and fields beyond the brook were closed in uncertain darkness. When she rose with the saucepan, leaving the drain steaming into the night behind her, she saw the yellow lamps were lit along the high road that went up the hill away beyond the space of the railway lines and the field.<br> Then again she watched the men trooping home, fewer now and fewer.<br> Indoors the fire was sinking and the room was dark red. The woman put her saucepan on the hob, and set a batter pudding near the mouth of the oven. Then she stood unmoving. Directly, gratefully, came quick young steps to the door. Someone hung on the latch a moment, then a little girl entered and began pulling off her outdoor things, dragging a mass of curls, just ripening from gold to brown, over her eyes with her hat.<br> Her mother chid her for coming late from school, and said she would have to keep her at home the dark winter days.<br> ‘Why, mother, it’s hardly a bit dark yet. The lamp’s not lighted, and my father’s not home.’<br> ‘No, he isn’t. But it’s a quarter to five! Did you see anything of him?’<br> The child became serious. She looked at her mother with large, wistful blue eyes.<br> ‘No, mother, I’ve never seen him. Why? Has he come up an’ gone past, to Old Brinsley? He hasn’t, mother, ‘cos I never saw him.’<br> ‘He’d watch that,’ said the mother bitterly, ‘he’d take care as you didn’t see him. But you may depend upon it, he’s seated in the ‘Prince o’ Wales’. He wouldn’t be this late.’<br> The girl looked at her mother piteously.<br> ‘Let’s have our teas, mother, should we?’ said she.<br> The mother called John to table. She opened the door once more and looked out across the darkness of the lines. All was deserted: she could not hear the winding-engines.<br> ‘Perhaps,’ she said to herself, ‘he’s stopped to get some ripping done.’<br> They sat down to tea. John, at the end of the table near the door, was almost lost in the darkness. Their faces were hidden from each other. The girl crouched against the fender slowly moving a thick piece of bread before the fire. The lad, his face a dusky mark on the shadow, sat watching her who was transfigured in the red glow.<br> ‘I do think it’s beautiful to look in the fire,’ said the child.<br> ‘Do you?’ said her mother. ‘Why?’<br> ‘It’s so red, and full of little caves — and it feels so nice, and you can fair smell it.’<br> ‘It’ll want mending directly,’ replied her mother, ‘and then if your father comes he’ll carry on and say there never is a fire when a man comes home sweating from the pit. — A public-house is always warm enough.’<br> There was silence till the boy said complainingly: ‘Make haste, our Annie.’<br> ‘Well, I am doing! I can’t make the fire do it no faster, can I?’<br> ‘She keeps wafflin’ it about so’s to make ‘er slow,’ grumbled the boy.<br> ‘Don’t have such an evil imagination, child,’ replied the mother.<br> Soon the room was busy in the darkness with the crisp sound of crunching. The mother ate very little. She drank her tea determinedly, and sat thinking. When she rose her anger was evident in the stern unbending of her head. She looked at the pudding in the fender, and broke out:<br> ‘It is a scandalous thing as a man can’t even come home to his dinner! If it’s crozzled up to a cinder I don’t see why I should care. Past his very door he goes to get to a public-house, and here I sit with his dinner waiting for him —’<br> She went out. As she dropped piece after piece of coal on the red fire, the shadows fell on the walls, till the room was almost in total darkness.<br> ‘I canna see,’ grumbled the invisible John. In spite of herself, the mother laughed.<br> ‘You know the way to your mouth,’ she said. She set the dustpan outside the door. When she came again like a shadow on the hearth, the lad repeated, complaining sulkily:<br> ‘I canna see.’<br> ‘Good gracious!’ cried the mother irritably, ‘you’re as bad as your father if it’s a bit dusk!’<br> Nevertheless she took a paper spill from a sheaf on the mantelpiece and proceeded to light the lamp that hung from the ceiling in the middle of the room. As she reached up, her figure displayed itself just rounding with maternity.<br> ‘Oh, mother —!’ exclaimed the girl.<br> ‘What?’ said the woman, suspended in the act of putting the lamp glass over the flame. The copper reflector shone handsomely on her, as she stood with uplifted arm, turning to face her daughter.<br> ‘You’ve got a flower in your apron!’ said the child, in a little rapture at this unusual event.<br> ‘Goodness me!’ exclaimed the woman, relieved. ‘One would think the house was afire.’ She replaced the glass and waited a moment before turning up the wick. A pale shadow was seen floating vaguely on the floor.<br> ‘Let me smell!’ said the child, still rapturously, coming forward and putting her face to her mother’s waist.<br> ‘Go along, silly!’ said the mother, turning up the lamp. The light revealed their suspense so that the woman felt it almost unbearable. Annie was still bending at her waist. Irritably, the mother took the flowers out from her apron-band.<br> ‘Oh, mother — don’t take them out!’ Annie cried, catching her hand and trying to replace the sprig.<br> ‘Such nonsense!’ said the mother, turning away. The child put the pale chrysanthemums to her lips, murmuring:<br> ‘Don’t they smell beautiful!’<br> Her mother gave a short laugh.<br> ‘No,’ she said, ‘not to me. It was chrysanthemums when I married him, and chrysanthemums when you were born, and the first time they ever brought him home drunk, he’d got brown chrysanthemums in his button-hole.’<br> She looked at the children. Their eyes and their parted lips were wondering. The mother sat rocking in silence for some time. Then she looked at the clock.<br> ‘Twenty minutes to six!’ In a tone of fine bitter carelessness she continued: ‘Eh, he’ll not come now till they bring him. There he’ll stick! But he needn’t come rolling in here in his pit-dirt, for I won’t wash him. He can lie on the floor — Eh, what a fool I’ve been, what a fool! And this is what I came here for, to this dirty hole, rats and all, for him to slink past his very door. Twice last week — he’s begun now-’<br> She silenced herself, and rose to clear the table.<br> While for an hour or more the children played, subduedly intent, fertile of imagination, united in fear of the mother’s wrath, and in dread of their father’s home-coming, Mrs Bates sat in her rocking-chair making a ‘singlet’ of thick cream-coloured flannel, which gave a dull wounded sound as she tore off the grey edge. She worked at her sewing with energy, listening to the children, and her anger wearied itself, lay down to rest, opening its eyes from time to time and steadily watching, its ears raised to listen. Sometimes even her anger quailed and shrank, and the mother suspended her sewing, tracing the footsteps that thudded along the sleepers outside; she would lift her head sharply to bid the children ‘hush’, but she recovered herself in time, and the footsteps went past the gate, and the children were not flung out of their playing world.<br> But at last Annie sighed, and gave in. She glanced at her waggon of slippers, and loathed the game. She turned plaintively to her mother.<br> ‘Mother!’— but she was inarticulate.<br> John crept out like a frog from under the sofa. His mother glanced up.<br> ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘just look at those shirt-sleeves!’<br> The boy held them out to survey them, saying nothing. Then somebody called in a hoarse voice away down the line, and suspense bristled in the room, till two people had gone by outside, talking.<br> ‘It is time for bed,’ said the mother.<br> ‘My father hasn’t come,’ wailed Annie plaintively. But her mother was primed with courage.<br> ‘Never mind. They’ll bring him when he does come — like a log.’ She meant there would be no scene. ‘And he may sleep on the floor till he wakes himself. I know he’ll not go to work tomorrow after this!’<br> The children had their hands and faces wiped with a flannel. They were very quiet. When they had put on their nightdresses, they said their prayers, the boy mumbling. The mother looked down at them, at the brown silken bush of intertwining curls in the nape of the girl’s neck, at the little black head of the lad, and her heart burst with anger at their father who caused all three such distress. The children hid their faces in her skirts for comfort.<br> When Mrs Bates came down, the room was strangely empty, with a tension of expectancy. She took up her sewing and stitched for some time without raising her head. Meantime her anger was tinged with fear.<br> II<br> <br> The clock struck eight and she rose suddenly, dropping her sewing on her chair. She went to the stairfoot door, opened it, listening. Then she went out, locking the door behind her.<br> Something scuffled in the yard, and she started, though she knew it was only the rats with which the place was overrun. The night was very dark. In the great bay of railway lines, bulked with trucks, there was no trace of light, only away back she could see a few yellow lamps at the pit-top, and the red smear of the burning pit-bank on the night. She hurried along the edge of the track, then, crossing the converging lines, came to the stile by the white gates, whence she emerged on the road. Then the fear which had led her shrank. People were walking up to New Brinsley; she saw the lights in the houses; twenty yards further on were the broad windows of the ‘Prince of Wales’, very warm and bright, and the loud voices of men could be heard distinctly. What a fool she had been to imagine that anything had happened to him! He was merely drinking over there at the ‘Prince of Wales’. She faltered. She had never yet been to fetch him, and she never would go. So she continued her walk towards the long straggling line of houses, standing blank on the highway. She entered a passage between the dwellings.<br> ‘Mr Rigley? — Yes! Did you want him? No, he’s not in at this minute.’<br> The raw-boned woman leaned forward from her dark scullery and peered at the other, upon whom fell a dim light through the blind of the kitchen window.<br> ‘Is it Mrs Bates?’ she asked in a tone tinged with respect.<br> ‘Yes. I wondered if your Master was at home. Mine hasn’t come yet.’<br> ‘‘Asn’t ‘e! Oh, Jack’s been ‘ome an ‘ad ‘is dinner an’ gone out. E’s just gone for ‘alf an hour afore bedtime. Did you call at the ‘Prince of Wales’?’<br> ‘No —’<br> ‘No, you didn’t like —! It’s not very nice.’ The other woman was indulgent. There was an awkward pause. ‘Jack never said nothink about — about your Mester,’ she said.<br> ‘No! — I expect he’s stuck in there!’<br> Elizabeth Bates said this bitterly, and with recklessness. She knew that the woman across the yard was standing at her door listening, but she did not care. As she turned:<br> ‘Stop a minute! I’ll just go an’ ask Jack if e’ knows anythink,’ said Mrs Rigley.<br> ‘Oh, no — I wouldn’t like to put —!’<br> ‘Yes, I will, if you’ll just step inside an’ see as th’ childer doesn’t come downstairs and set theirselves afire.’<br> Elizabeth Bates, murmuring a remonstrance, stepped inside. The other woman apologized for the state of the room.<br> The kitchen needed apology. There were little frocks and trousers and childish undergarments on the squab and on the floor, and a litter of playthings everywhere. On the black American cloth of the table were pieces of bread and cake, crusts, slops, and a teapot with cold tea.<br> ‘Eh, ours is just as bad,’ said Elizabeth Bates, looking at the woman, not at the house. Mrs Rigley put a shawl over her head and hurried out, saying:<br> ‘I shanna be a minute.’<br> The other sat, noting with faint disapproval the general untidiness of the room. Then she fell to counting the shoes of various sizes scattered over the floor. There were twelve. She sighed and said to herself, ‘No wonder!’— glancing at the litter. There came the scratching of two pairs of feet on the yard, and the Rigleys entered. Elizabeth Bates rose. Rigley was a big man, with very large bones. His head looked particularly bony. Across his temple was a blue scar, caused by a wound got in the pit, a wound in which the coal-dust remained blue like tattooing.<br> ‘Asna ‘e come whoam yit?’ asked the man, without any form of greeting, but with deference and sympathy. ‘I couldna say wheer he is —‘e’s non ower theer!’— he jerked his head to signify the ‘Prince of Wales’.<br> ‘‘E’s ‘appen gone up to th’ ‘Yew’,’ said Mrs Rigley.<br> There was another pause. Rigley had evidently something to get off his mind:<br> ‘Ah left ’im finishin’ a stint,’ he began. ‘Loose-all ‘ad bin gone about ten minutes when we com’n away, an’ I shouted, ‘Are ter comin’, Walt?’ an’ ‘e said, ‘Go on, Ah shanna be but a’ef a minnit,’ so we com’n ter th’ bottom, me an’ Bowers, thinkin’ as ‘e wor just behint, an’ ‘ud come up i’ th’ next bantle —’<br> He stood perplexed, as if answering a charge of deserting his mate. Elizabeth Bates, now again certain of disaster, hastened to reassure him:<br> ‘I expect ‘e’s gone up to th’ ‘Yew Tree’, as you say. It’s not the first time. I’ve fretted myself into a fever before now. He’ll come home when they carry him.’<br> ‘Ay, isn’t it too bad!’ deplored the other woman.<br> ‘I’ll just step up to Dick’s an’ see if ‘e IS theer,’ offered the man, afraid of appearing alarmed, afraid of taking liberties.<br> ‘Oh, I wouldn’t think of bothering you that far,’ said Elizabeth Bates, with emphasis, but he knew she was glad of his offer.<br> As they stumbled up the entry, Elizabeth Bates heard Rigley’s wife run across the yard and open her neighbour’s door. At this, suddenly all the blood in her body seemed to switch away from her heart.<br> ‘Mind!’ warned Rigley. ‘Ah’ve said many a time as Ah’d fill up them ruts in this entry, sumb’dy ‘ll be breakin’ their legs yit.’<br> She recovered herself and walked quickly along with the miner.<br> ‘I don’t like leaving the children in bed, and nobody in the house,’ she said.<br> ‘No, you dunna!’ he replied courteously. They were soon at the gate of the cottage.<br> ‘Well, I shanna be many minnits. Dunna you be frettin’ now, ‘e’ll be all right,’ said the butty.<br> ‘Thank you very much, Mr Rigley,’ she replied.<br> ‘You’re welcome!’ he stammered, moving away. ‘I shanna be many minnits.’<br> The house was quiet. Elizabeth Bates took off her hat and shawl, and rolled back the rug. When she had finished, she sat down. It was a few minutes past nine. She was startled by the rapid chuff of the winding-engine at the pit, and the sharp whirr of the brakes on the rope as it descended. Again she felt the painful sweep of her blood, and she put her hand to her side, saying aloud, ‘Good gracious! — it’s only the nine o’clock deputy going down,’ rebuking herself.<br> She sat still, listening. Half an hour of this, and she was wearied out.<br> ‘What am I working myself up like this for?’ she said pitiably to herself, ‘I s’ll only be doing myself some damage.’<br> She took out her sewing again.<br> At a quarter to ten there were footsteps. One person! She watched for the door to open. It was an elderly woman, in a black bonnet and a black woollen shawl — his mother. She was about sixty years old, pale, with blue eyes, and her face all wrinkled and lamentable. She shut the door and turned to her daughter-inlaw peevishly.<br> ‘Eh, Lizzie, whatever shall we do, whatever shall we do!’ she cried.<br> Elizabeth drew back a little, sharply.<br> ‘What is it, mother?’ she said.<br> The elder woman seated herself on the sofa.<br> ‘I don’t know, child, I can’t tell you!’— she shook her head slowly. Elizabeth sat watching her, anxious and vexed.<br> ‘I don’t know,’ replied the grandmother, sighing very deeply. ‘There’s no end to my troubles, there isn’t. The things I’ve gone through, I’m sure it’s enough —!’ She wept without wiping her eyes, the tears running.<br> ‘But, mother,’ interrupted Elizabeth, ‘what do you mean? What is it?’<br> The grandmother slowly wiped her eyes. The fountains of her tears were stopped by Elizabeth’s directness. She wiped her eyes slowly.<br> ‘Poor child! Eh, you poor thing!’ she moaned. ‘I don’t know what we’re going to do, I don’t — and you as you are — it’s a thing, it is indeed!’<br> Elizabeth waited.<br> ‘Is he dead?’ she asked, and at the words her heart swung violently, though she felt a slight flush of shame at the ultimate extravagance of the question. Her words sufficiently frightened the old lady, almost brought her to herself.<br> ‘Don’t say so, Elizabeth! We’ll hope it’s not as bad as that; no, may the Lord spare us that, Elizabeth. Jack Rigley came just as I was sittin’ down to a glass afore going to bed, an’ ‘e said, ‘‘Appen you’ll go down th’ line, Mrs Bates. Walt’s had an accident. ‘Appen you’ll go an’ sit wi’ ‘er till we can get him home.’ I hadn’t time to ask him a word afore he was gone. An’ I put my bonnet on an’ come straight down, Lizzie. I thought to myself, ‘Eh, that poor blessed child, if anybody should come an’ tell her of a sudden, there’s no knowin’ what’ll ‘appen to ‘er.’ You mustn’t let it upset you, Lizzie — or you know what to expect. How long is it, six months — or is it five, Lizzie? Ay!’— the old woman shook her head —’time slips on, it slips on! Ay!’<br> Elizabeth’s thoughts were busy elsewhere. If he was killed — would she be able to manage on the little pension and what she could earn? — she counted up rapidly. If he was hurt — they wouldn’t take him to the hospital — how tiresome he would be to nurse! — but perhaps she’d be able to get him away from the drink and his hateful ways. She would — while he was ill. The tears offered to come to her eyes at the picture. But what sentimental luxury was this she was beginning? — She turned to consider the children. At any rate she was absolutely necessary for them. They were her business.<br> ‘Ay!’ repeated the old woman, ‘it seems but a week or two since he brought me his first wages. Ay — he was a good lad, Elizabeth, he was, in his way. I don’t know why he got to be such a trouble, I don’t. He was a happy lad at home, only full of spirits. But there’s no mistake he’s been a handful of trouble, he has! I hope the Lord’ll spare him to mend his ways. I hope so, I hope so. You’ve had a sight o’ trouble with him, Elizabeth, you have indeed. But he was a jolly enough lad wi’ me, he was, I can assure you. I don’t know how it is . . .’<br> The old woman continued to muse aloud, a monotonous irritating sound, while Elizabeth thought concentratedly, startled once, when she heard the winding-engine chuff quickly, and the brakes skirr with a shriek. Then she heard the engine more slowly, and the brakes made no sound. The old woman did not notice. Elizabeth waited in suspense. The mother-inlaw talked, with lapses into silence.<br> ‘But he wasn’t your son, Lizzie, an’ it makes a difference. Whatever he was, I remember him when he was little, an’ I learned to understand him and to make allowances. You’ve got to make allowances for them —’<br> It was half-past ten, and the old woman was saying: ‘But it’s trouble from beginning to end; you’re never too old for trouble, never too old for that —’ when the gate banged back, and there were heavy feet on the steps.<br> ‘I’ll go, Lizzie, let me go,’ cried the old woman, rising. But Elizabeth was at the door. It was a man in pit-clothes.<br> ‘They’re bringin’ ’im, Missis,’ he said. Elizabeth’s heart halted a moment. Then it surged on again, almost suffocating her.<br> ‘Is he — is it bad?’ she asked.<br> The man turned away, looking at the darkness:<br> ‘The doctor says ‘e’d been dead hours. ‘E saw ’im i’ th’ lamp-cabin.’<br> The old woman, who stood just behind Elizabeth, dropped into a chair, and folded her hands, crying: ‘Oh, my boy, my boy!’<br> ‘Hush!’ said Elizabeth, with a sharp twitch of a frown. ‘Be still, mother, don’t waken th’ children: I wouldn’t have them down for anything!’<br> The old woman moaned softly, rocking herself. The man was drawing away. Elizabeth took a step forward.<br> ‘How was it?’ she asked.<br> ‘Well, I couldn’t say for sure,’ the man replied, very ill at ease. ‘‘E wor finishin’ a stint an’ th’ butties ‘ad gone, an’ a lot o’ stuff come down atop ‘n ’im.’<br> ‘And crushed him?’ cried the widow, with a shudder.<br> ‘No,’ said the man, ‘it fell at th’ back of ’im. ‘E wor under th’ face, an’ it niver touched ’im. It shut ’im in. It seems ‘e wor smothered.’<br> Elizabeth shrank back. She heard the old woman behind her cry:<br> ‘What? — what did ‘e say it was?’<br> The man replied, more loudly: ‘‘E wor smothered!’<br> Then the old woman wailed aloud, and this relieved Elizabeth.<br> ‘Oh, mother,’ she said, putting her hand on the old woman, ‘don’t waken th’ children, don’t waken th’ children.’<br> She wept a little, unknowing, while the old mother rocked herself and moaned. Elizabeth remembered that they were bringing him home, and she must be ready. ‘They’ll lay him in the parlour,’ she said to herself, standing a moment pale and perplexed.<br> Then she lighted a candle and went into the tiny room. The air was cold and damp, but she could not make a fire, there was no fireplace. She set down the candle and looked round. The candle-light glittered on the lustre-glasses, on the two vases that held some of the pink chrysanthemums, and on the dark mahogany. There was a cold, deathly smell of chrysanthemums in the room. Elizabeth stood looking at the flowers. She turned away, and calculated whether there would be room to lay him on the floor, between the couch and the chiffonier. She pushed the chairs aside. There would be room to lay him down and to step round him. Then she fetched the old red tablecloth, and another old cloth, spreading them down to save her bit of carpet. She shivered on leaving the parlour; so, from the dresser-drawer she took a clean shirt and put it at the fire to air. All the time her mother-inlaw was rocking herself in the chair and moaning.<br> ‘You’ll have to move from there, mother,’ said Elizabeth. ‘They’ll be bringing him in. Come in the rocker.’<br> The old mother rose mechanically, and seated herself by the fire, continuing to lament. Elizabeth went into the pantry for another candle, and there, in the little penthouse under the naked tiles, she heard them coming. She stood still in the pantry doorway, listening. She heard them pass the end of the house, and come awkwardly down the three steps, a jumble of shuffling footsteps and muttering voices. The old woman was silent. The men were in the yard.<br> Then Elizabeth heard Matthews, the manager of the pit, say: ‘You go in first, Jim. Mind!’<br> The door came open, and the two women saw a collier backing into the room, holding one end of a stretcher, on which they could see the nailed pit-boots of the dead man. The two carriers halted, the man at the head stooping to the lintel of the door.<br> ‘Wheer will you have him?’ asked the manager, a short, white-bearded man.<br> Elizabeth roused herself and came from the pantry carrying the unlighted candle.<br> ‘In the parlour,’ she said.<br> ‘In there, Jim!’ pointed the manager, and the carriers backed round into the tiny room. The coat with which they had covered the body fell off as they awkwardly turned through the two doorways, and the women saw their man, naked to the waist, lying stripped for work. The old woman began to moan in a low voice of horror.<br> ‘Lay th’ stretcher at th’ side,’ snapped the manager, ‘an’ put ’im on th’ cloths. Mind now, mind! Look you now —!’<br> One of the men had knocked off a vase of chrysanthemums. He stared awkwardly, then they set down the stretcher. Elizabeth did not look at her husband. As soon as she could get in the room, she went and picked up the broken vase and the flowers.<br> ‘Wait a minute!’ she said.<br> The three men waited in silence while she mopped up the water with a duster.<br> ‘Eh, what a job, what a job, to be sure!’ the manager was saying, rubbing his brow with trouble and perplexity. ‘Never knew such a thing in my life, never! He’d no business to ha’ been left. I never knew such a thing in my life! Fell over him clean as a whistle, an’ shut him in. Not four foot of space, there wasn’t — yet it scarce bruised him.’<br> He looked down at the dead man, lying prone, half naked, all grimed with coal-dust.<br> ‘’‘Sphyxiated,’ the doctor said. It IS the most terrible job I’ve ever known. Seems as if it was done o’ purpose. Clean over him, an’ shut ’im in, like a mouse-trap’— he made a sharp, descending gesture with his hand.<br> The colliers standing by jerked aside their heads in hopeless comment.<br> The horror of the thing bristled upon them all.<br> Then they heard the girl’s voice upstairs calling shrilly: ‘Mother, mother — who is it? Mother, who is it?’<br> Elizabeth hurried to the foot of the stairs and opened the door:<br> ‘Go to sleep!’ she commanded sharply. ‘What are you shouting about? Go to sleep at once — there’s nothing —’<br> Then she began to mount the stairs. They could hear her on the boards, and on the plaster floor of the little bedroom. They could hear her distinctly:<br> ‘What’s the matter now? — what’s the matter with you, silly thing?’— her voice was much agitated, with an unreal gentleness.<br> ‘I thought it was some men come,’ said the plaintive voice of the child. ‘Has he come?’<br> ‘Yes, they’ve brought him. There’s nothing to make a fuss about. Go to sleep now, like a good child.’<br> They could hear her voice in the bedroom, they waited whilst she covered the children under the bedclothes.<br> ‘Is he drunk?’ asked the girl, timidly, faintly.<br> ‘No! No — he’s not! He — he’s asleep.’<br> ‘Is he asleep downstairs?’<br> ‘Yes — and don’t make a noise.’<br> There was silence for a moment, then the men heard the frightened child again:<br> ‘What’s that noise?’<br> ‘It’s nothing, I tell you, what are you bothering for?’<br> The noise was the grandmother moaning. She was oblivious of everything, sitting on her chair rocking and moaning. The manager put his hand on her arm and bade her ‘Sh — sh!!’<br> The old woman opened her eyes and looked at him. She was shocked by this interruption, and seemed to wonder.<br> ‘What time is it?’— the plaintive thin voice of the child, sinking back unhappily into sleep, asked this last question.<br> ‘Ten o’clock,’ answered the mother more softly. Then she must have bent down and kissed the children.<br> Matthews beckoned to the men to come away. They put on their caps and took up the stretcher. Stepping over the body, they tiptoed out of the house. None of them spoke till they were far from the wakeful children.<br> When Elizabeth came down she found her mother alone on the parlour floor, leaning over the dead man, the tears dropping on him.<br> ‘We must lay him out,’ the wife said. She put on the kettle, then returning knelt at the feet, and began to unfasten the knotted leather laces. The room was clammy and dim with only one candle, so that she had to bend her face almost to the floor. At last she got off the heavy boots and put them away.<br> ‘You must help me now,’ she whispered to the old woman. Together they stripped the man.<br> When they arose, saw him lying in the naïve dignity of death, the women stood arrested in fear and respect. For a few moments they remained still, looking down, the old mother whimpering. Elizabeth felt countermanded. She saw him, how utterly inviolable he lay in himself. She had nothing to do with him. She could not accept it. Stooping, she laid her hand on him, in claim. He was still warm, for the mine was hot where he had died. His mother had his face between her hands, and was murmuring incoherently. The old tears fell in succession as drops from wet leaves; the mother was not weeping, merely her tears flowed. Elizabeth embraced the body of her husband, with cheek and lips. She seemed to be listening, inquiring, trying to get some connection. But she could not. She was driven away. He was impregnable.<br> She rose, went into the kitchen, where she poured warm water into a bowl, brought soap and flannel and a soft towel.<br> ‘I must wash him,’ she said.<br> Then the old mother rose stiffly, and watched Elizabeth as she carefully washed his face, carefully brushing the big blond moustache from his mouth with the flannel. She was afraid with a bottomless fear, so she ministered to him. The old woman, jealous, said:<br> ‘Let me wipe him!’— and she kneeled on the other side drying slowly as Elizabeth washed, her big black bonnet sometimes brushing the dark head of her daughter. They worked thus in silence for a long time. They never forgot it was death, and the touch of the man’s dead body gave them strange emotions, different in each of the women; a great dread possessed them both, the mother felt the lie was given to her womb, she was denied; the wife felt the utter isolation of the human soul, the child within her was a weight apart from her.<br> At last it was finished. He was a man of handsome body, and his face showed no traces of drink. He was blonde, full-fleshed, with fine limbs. But he was dead.<br> ‘Bless him,’ whispered his mother, looking always at his face, and speaking out of sheer terror. ‘Dear lad — bless him!’ She spoke in a faint, sibilant ecstasy of fear and mother love.<br> Elizabeth sank down again to the floor, and put her face against his neck, and trembled and shuddered. But she had to draw away again. He was dead, and her living flesh had no place against his. A great dread and weariness held her: she was so unavailing. Her life was gone like this.<br> ‘White as milk he is, clear as a twelve-month baby, bless him, the darling!’ the old mother murmured to herself. ‘Not a mark on him, clear and clean and white, beautiful as ever a child was made,’ she murmured with pride. Elizabeth kept her face hidden.<br> ‘He went peaceful, Lizzie — peaceful as sleep. Isn’t he beautiful, the lamb? Ay — he must ha’ made his peace, Lizzie. ‘Appen he made it all right, Lizzie, shut in there. He’d have time. He wouldn’t look like this if he hadn’t made his peace. The lamb, the dear lamb. Eh, but he had a hearty laugh. I loved to hear it. He had the heartiest laugh, Lizzie, as a lad —’<br> Elizabeth looked up. The man’s mouth was fallen back, slightly open under the cover of the moustache. The eyes, half shut, did not show glazed in the obscurity. Life with its smoky burning gone from him, had left him apart and utterly alien to her. And she knew what a stranger he was to her. In her womb was ice of fear, because of this separate stranger with whom she had been living as one flesh. Was this what it all meant — utter, intact separateness, obscured by heat of living? In dread she turned her face away. The fact was too deadly. There had been nothing between them, and yet they had come together, exchanging their nakedness repeatedly. Each time he had taken her, they had been two isolated beings, far apart as now. He was no more responsible than she. The child was like ice in her womb. For as she looked at the dead man, her mind, cold and detached, said clearly: ‘Who am I? What have I been doing? I have been fighting a husband who did not exist. HE existed all the time. What wrong have I done? What was that I have been living with? There lies the reality, this man.’— And her soul died in her for fear: she knew she had never seen him, he had never seen her, they had met in the dark and had fought in the dark, not knowing whom they met nor whom they fought. And now she saw, and turned silent in seeing. For she had been wrong. She had said he was something he was not; she had felt familiar with him. Whereas he was apart all the while, living as she never lived, feeling as she never felt.<br> In fear and shame she looked at his naked body, that she had known falsely. And he was the father of her children. Her soul was torn from her body and stood apart. She looked at his naked body and was ashamed, as if she had denied it. After all, it was itself. It seemed awful to her. She looked at his face, and she turned her own face to the wall. For his look was other than hers, his way was not her way. She had denied him what he was — she saw it now. She had refused him as himself. — And this had been her life, and his life. — She was grateful to death, which restored the truth. And she knew she was not dead.<br> And all the while her heart was bursting with grief and pity for him. What had he suffered? What stretch of horror for this helpless man! She was rigid with agony. She had not been able to help him. He had been cruelly injured, this naked man, this other being, and she could make no reparation. There were the children — but the children belonged to life. This dead man had nothing to do with them. He and she were only channels through which life had flowed to issue in the children. She was a mother — but how awful she knew it now to have been a wife. And he, dead now, how awful he must have felt it to be a husband. She felt that in the next world he would be a stranger to her. If they met there, in the beyond, they would only be ashamed of what had been before. The children had come, for some mysterious reason, out of both of them. But the children did not unite them. Now he was dead, she knew how eternally he was apart from her, how eternally he had nothing more to do with her. She saw this episode of her life closed. They had denied each other in life. Now he had withdrawn. An anguish came over her. It was finished then: it had become hopeless between them long before he died. Yet he had been her husband. But how little! —<br> ‘Have you got his shirt, ‘Lizabeth?’<br> Elizabeth turned without answering, though she strove to weep and behave as her mother-inlaw expected. But she could not, she was silenced. She went into the kitchen and returned with the garment.<br> ‘It is aired,’ she said, grasping the cotton shirt here and there to try. She was almost ashamed to handle him; what right had she or anyone to lay hands on him; but her touch was humble on his body. It was hard work to clothe him. He was so heavy and inert. A terrible dread gripped her all the while: that he could be so heavy and utterly inert, unresponsive, apart. The horror of the distance between them was almost too much for her — it was so infinite a gap she must look across.<br> At last it was finished. They covered him with a sheet and left him lying, with his face bound. And she fastened the door of the little parlour, lest the children should see what was lying there. Then, with peace sunk heavy on her heart, she went about making tidy the kitchen. She knew she submitted to life, which was her immediate master. But from death, her ultimate master, she winced with fear and shame.</p><br>There was a woman who was beautiful, who started with all the advantages, yet she had no luck. She married for love, and the love turned to dust. She had bonny children, yet she felt they had been thrust upon her, and she could not love them. They looked at her coldly, as if they were finding fault with her. And hurriedly she felt she must cover up some fault in herself. Yet what it was that she must cover up she never knew. Nevertheless, when her children were present, she always felt the centre of her heart go hard. This troubled her, and in her manner she was all the more gentle and anxious for her children, as if she loved them very much. Only she herself knew that at the centre of her heart was a hard little place that could not feel love, no, not for anybody. Everybody else said of her: ‘She is such a good mother. She adores her children.’ Only she herself, and her children themselves, knew it was not so. They read it in each other's eyes. <br> <br> There were a boy and two little girls. They lived in a pleasant house, with a garden, and they had discreet servants, and felt themselves superior to anyone in the neighbourhood. <br> <br> Although they lived in style, they felt always an anxiety in the house. There was never enough money. The mother had a small income, and the father had a small income, but not nearly enough for the social position which they had to keep up. The father went into town to some office. But though he had good prospects, these prospects never materialised. There was always the grinding sense of the shortage of money, though the style was always kept up. <br> <br> At last the mother said: ‘I will see if I can't make something.’ But she did not know where to begin. She racked her brains, and tried this thing and the other, but could not find anything successful. The failure made deep lines come into her face. Her children were growing up, they would have to go to school. There must be more money, there must be more money. The father, who was always very handsome and expensive in his tastes, seemed as if he never would be able to do anything worth doing. And the mother, who had a great belief in herself, did not succeed any better, and her tastes were just as expensive. <br> <br> And so the house came to be haunted by the unspoken phrase: There must be more money! There must be more money! The children could hear it all the time though nobody said it aloud. They heard it at Christmas, when the expensive and splendid toys filled the nursery. Behind the shining modern rocking-horse, behind the smart doll's house, a voice would start whispering: ‘There must be more money! There must be more money!’ And the children would stop playing, to listen for a moment. They would look into each other's eyes, to see if they had all heard. And each one saw in the eyes of the other two that they too had heard. ‘There must be more money! There must be more money!’ <br> <br> It came whispering from the springs of the still-swaying rocking-horse, and even the horse, bending his wooden, champing head, heard it. The big doll, sitting so pink and smirking in her new pram, could hear it quite plainly, and seemed to be smirking all the more self-consciously because of it. The foolish puppy, too, that took the place of the teddy-bear, he was looking so extraordinarily foolish for no other reason but that he heard the secret whisper all over the house: ‘There must be more money!’ <br> <br> Yet nobody ever said it aloud. The whisper was everywhere, and therefore no one spoke it. Just as no one ever says: ‘We are breathing!’ in spite of the fact that breath is coming and going all the time. <br> <br> ‘Mother,’ said the boy Paul one day, ‘why don't we keep a car of our own? Why do we always use uncle's, or else a taxi?’ <br> <br> ‘Because we're the poor members of the family,’ said the mother. <br> <br> ‘But why are we, mother?’ <br> <br> ‘Well - I suppose,’ she said slowly and bitterly, ‘it's because your father has no luck.’ <br> <br> The boy was silent for some time. <br> <br> ‘Is luck money, mother?’ he asked, rather timidly. <br> <br> ‘No, Paul. Not quite. It's what causes you to have money.’ <br> <br> ‘Oh!’ said Paul vaguely. ‘I thought when Uncle Oscar said filthy lucker, it meant money.’ <br> <br> ‘Filthy lucre does mean money,’ said the mother. ‘But it's lucre, not luck.’ <br> <br> ‘Oh!’ said the boy. ‘Then what is luck, mother?’ <br> <br> ‘It's what causes you to have money. If you're lucky you have money. That's why it's better to be born lucky than rich. If you're rich, you may lose your money. But if you're lucky, you will always get more money.’ <br> <br> ‘Oh! Will you? And is father not lucky?’ <br> <br> ‘Very unlucky, I should say,’ she said bitterly. <br> <br> The boy watched her with unsure eyes. <br> <br> ‘Why?’ he asked. <br> <br> ‘I don't know. Nobody ever knows why one person is lucky and another unlucky.’ <br> <br> ‘Don't they? Nobody at all? Does nobody know?’ <br> <br> ‘Perhaps God. But He never tells.’ <br> <br> ‘He ought to, then. And are'nt you lucky either, mother?’ <br> <br> ‘I can't be, it I married an unlucky husband.’ <br> <br> ‘But by yourself, aren't you?’ <br> <br> ‘I used to think I was, before I married. Now I think I am very unlucky indeed.’ <br> <br> ‘Why?’ <br> <br> ‘Well - never mind! Perhaps I'm not really,’ she said. <br> <br> The child looked at her to see if she meant it. But he saw, by the lines of her mouth, that she was only trying to hide something from him. <br> <br> ‘Well, anyhow,’ he said stoutly, ‘I'm a lucky person.’ <br> <br> ‘Why?’ said his mother, with a sudden laugh. <br> <br> He stared at her. He didn't even know why he had said it. <br> <br> ‘God told me,’ he asserted, brazening it out. <br> <br> ‘I hope He did, dear!’, she said, again with a laugh, but rather bitter. <br> <br> ‘He did, mother!’ <br> <br> ‘Excellent!’ said the mother, using one of her husband's exclamations. <br> <br> The boy saw she did not believe him; or rather, that she paid no attention to his assertion. This angered him somewhere, and made him want to compel her attention. <br> <br> He went off by himself, vaguely, in a childish way, seeking for the clue to 'luck'. Absorbed, taking no heed of other people, he went about with a sort of stealth, seeking inwardly for luck. He wanted luck, he wanted it, he wanted it. When the two girls were playing dolls in the nursery, he would sit on his big rocking-horse, charging madly into space, with a frenzy that made the little girls peer at him uneasily. Wildly the horse careered, the waving dark hair of the boy tossed, his eyes had a strange glare in them. The little girls dared not speak to him. <br> <br> When he had ridden to the end of his mad little journey, he climbed down and stood in front of his rocking-horse, staring fixedly into its lowered face. Its red mouth was slightly open, its big eye was wide and glassy-bright. <br> <br> ‘Now!’ he would silently command the snorting steed. ‘Now take me to where there is luck! Now take me!’ <br> <br> And he would slash the horse on the neck with the little whip he had asked Uncle Oscar for. He knew the horse could take him to where there was luck, if only he forced it. So he would mount again and start on his furious ride, hoping at last to get there.<br> <br> ‘You'll break your horse, Paul!’ said the nurse. <br> <br> ‘He's always riding like that! I wish he'd leave off!’ said his elder sister Joan. <br> <br> But he only glared down on them in silence. Nurse gave him up. She could make nothing of him. Anyhow, he was growing beyond her. <br> <br> One day his mother and his Uncle Oscar came in when he was on one of his furious rides. He did not speak to them. <br> <br> ‘Hallo, you young jockey! Riding a winner?’ said his uncle. <br> <br> ‘Aren't you growing too big for a rocking-horse? You're not a very little boy any longer, you know,’ said his mother. <br> <br> But Paul only gave a blue glare from his big, rather close-set eyes. He would speak to nobody when he was in full tilt. His mother watched him with an anxious expression on her face. <br> <br> At last he suddenly stopped forcing his horse into the mechanical gallop and slid down. <br> <br> ‘Well, I got there!’ he announced fiercely, his blue eyes still flaring, and his sturdy long legs straddling apart. <br> <br> ‘Where did you get to?’ asked his mother. <br> <br> ‘Where I wanted to go,’ he flared back at her. <br> <br> ‘That's right, son!’ said Uncle Oscar. ‘Don't you stop till you get there. What's the horse's name?’ <br> <br> ‘He doesn't have a name,’ said the boy. <br> <br> ‘Get's on without all right?’ asked the uncle.<br> <br> ‘Well, he has different names. He was called Sansovino last week.’ <br> <br> ‘Sansovino, eh? Won the Ascot. How did you know this name?’ <br> <br> ‘He always talks about horse-races with Bassett,’ said Joan. <br> <br> The uncle was delighted to find that his small nephew was posted with all the racing news. Bassett, the young gardener, who had been wounded in the left foot in the war and had got his present job through Oscar Cresswell, whose batman he had been, was a perfect blade of the 'turf'. He lived in the racing events, and the small boy lived with him. <br> <br> Oscar Cresswell got it all from Bassett. <br> <br> ‘Master Paul comes and asks me, so I can't do more than tell him, sir,’ said Bassett, his face terribly serious, as if he were speaking of religious matters. <br> <br> ‘And does he ever put anything on a horse he fancies?’ <br> <br> ‘Well - I don't want to give him away - he's a young sport, a fine sport, sir. Would you mind asking him himself? He sort of takes a pleasure in it, and perhaps he'd feel I was giving him away, sir, if you don't mind. <br> <br> Bassett was serious as a church. <br> <br> The uncle went back to his nephew and took him off for a ride in the car. <br> <br> ‘Say, Paul, old man, do you ever put anything on a horse?’ the uncle asked. <br> <br> The boy watched the handsome man closely. <br> <br> ‘Why, do you think I oughtn't to?’ he parried. <br> <br> ‘Not a bit of it! I thought perhaps you might give me a tip for the Lincoln.’ <br> <br> The car sped on into the country, going down to Uncle Oscar's place in Hampshire. <br> <br> ‘Honour bright?’ said the nephew. <br> <br> ‘Honour bright, son!’ said the uncle. <br> <br> ‘Well, then, Daffodil.’ <br> <br> ‘Daffodil! I doubt it, sonny. What about Mirza?’ <br> <br> ‘I only know the winner,’ said the boy. ‘That's Daffodil.’ <br> <br> ‘Daffodil, eh?’ <br> <br> There was a pause. Daffodil was an obscure horse comparatively. <br> <br> ‘Uncle!’ <br> <br> ‘Yes, son?’ <br> <br> ‘You won't let it go any further, will you? I promised Bassett.’ <br> <br> ‘Bassett be damned, old man! What's he got to do with it?’ <br> <br> ‘We're partners. We've been partners from the first. Uncle, he lent me my first five shillings, which I lost. I promised him, honour bright, it was only between me and him; only you gave me that ten-shilling note I started winning with, so I thought you were lucky. You won't let it go any further, will you?’ <br> <br> The boy gazed at his uncle from those big, hot, blue eyes, set rather close together. The uncle stirred and laughed uneasily. <br> <br> ‘Right you are, son! I'll keep your tip private. How much are you putting on him?’ <br> <br> ‘All except twenty pounds,’ said the boy. ‘I keep that in reserve.’ <br> <br> The uncle thought it a good joke. <br> <br> ‘You keep twenty pounds in reserve, do you, you young romancer? What are you betting, then?’ <br> <br> ‘I'm betting three hundred,’ said the boy gravely. ‘But it's between you and me, Uncle Oscar! Honour bright?’ <br> <br> ‘It's between you and me all right, you young Nat Gould,’ he said, laughing. ‘But where's your three hundred?’ <br> <br> ‘Bassett keeps it for me. We're partner's.’ <br> <br> ‘You are, are you! And what is Bassett putting on Daffodil?’ <br> <br> ‘He won't go quite as high as I do, I expect. Perhaps he'll go a hundred and fifty.’ <br> <br> ‘What, pennies?’ laughed the uncle. <br> <br> ‘Pounds,’ said the child, with a surprised look at his uncle. ‘Bassett keeps a bigger reserve than I do.’ <br> <br> Between wonder and amusement Uncle Oscar was silent. He pursued the matter no further, but he determined to take his nephew with him to the Lincoln races. <br> <br> ‘Now, son,’ he said, ‘I'm putting twenty on Mirza, and I'll put five on for you on any horse you fancy. What's your pick?’ <br> <br> ‘Daffodil, uncle.’ <br> <br> ‘No, not the fiver on Daffodil!’ <br> <br> ‘I should if it was my own fiver,’ said the child. <br> <br> ‘Good! Good! Right you are! A fiver for me and a fiver for you on Daffodil.’ <br> <br> The child had never been to a race-meeting before, and his eyes were blue fire. He pursed his mouth tight and watched. A Frenchman just in front had put his money on Lancelot. Wild with excitement, he flayed his arms up and down, yelling ‘Lancelot!, Lancelot!’ in his French accent. <br> <br> Daffodil came in first, Lancelot second, Mirza third. The child, flushed and with eyes blazing, was curiously serene. His uncle brought him four five-pound notes, four to one. <br> <br> ‘What am I to do with these?’ he cried, waving them before the boys eyes. <br> <br> ‘I suppose we'll talk to Bassett,’ said the boy. ‘I expect I have fifteen hundred now; and twenty in reserve; and this twenty.’<br> <br> His uncle studied him for some moments. <br> <br> ‘Look here, son!’ he said. ‘You're not serious about Bassett and that fifteen hundred, are you?’ <br> <br> ‘Yes, I am. But it's between you and me, uncle. Honour bright?’ <br> <br> ‘Honour bright all right, son! But I must talk to Bassett.’ <br> <br> ‘If you'd like to be a partner, uncle, with Bassett and me, we could all be partners. Only, you'd have to promise, honour bright, uncle, not to let it go beyond us three. Bassett and I are lucky, and you must be lucky, because it was your ten shillings I started winning with ...’ <br> <br> Uncle Oscar took both Bassett and Paul into Richmond Park for an afternoon, and there they talked. <br> <br> ‘It's like this, you see, sir,’ Bassett said. ‘Master Paul would get me talking about racing events, spinning yarns, you know, sir. And he was always keen on knowing if I'd made or if I'd lost. It's about a year since, now, that I put five shillings on Blush of Dawn for him: and we lost. Then the luck turned, with that ten shillings he had from you: that we put on Singhalese. And since that time, it's been pretty steady, all things considering. What do you say, Master Paul?’ <br> <br> ‘We're all right when we're sure,’ said Paul. ‘It's when we're not quite sure that we go down.’ <br> <br> ‘Oh, but we're careful then,’ said Bassett. <br> <br> ‘But when are you sure?’ smiled Uncle Oscar. <br> <br> ‘It's Master Paul, sir,’ said Bassett in a secret, religious voice. ‘It's as if he had it from heaven. Like Daffodil, now, for the Lincoln. That was as sure as eggs.’ <br> <br> ‘Did you put anything on Daffodil?’ asked Oscar Cresswell. <br> <br> ‘Yes, sir, I made my bit.’<br> <br> ‘And my nephew?’ <br> <br> Bassett was obstinately silent, looking at Paul. <br> <br> ‘I made twelve hundred, didn't I, Bassett? I told uncle I was putting three hundred on Daffodil.’ <br> <br> ‘That's right,’ said Bassett, nodding. <br> <br> ‘But where's the money?’ asked the uncle. <br> <br> ‘I keep it safe locked up, sir. Master Paul he can have it any minute he likes to ask for it.’ <br> <br> ‘What, fifteen hundred pounds?’ <br> <br> ‘And twenty! And forty, that is, with the twenty he made on the course.’ <br> <br> ‘It's amazing!’ said the uncle. <br> <br> ‘If Master Paul offers you to be partners, sir, I would, if I were you: if you'll excuse me,’ said Bassett. <br> <br> Oscar Cresswell thought about it. <br> <br> ‘I'll see the money,’ he said. <br> <br> They drove home again, and, sure enough, Bassett came round to the garden-house with fifteen hundred pounds in notes. The twenty pounds reserve was left with Joe Glee, in the Turf Commission deposit. <br> <br> ‘You see, it's all right, uncle, when I'm sure! Then we go strong, for all we're worth, don't we, Bassett?’ <br> <br> ‘We do that, Master Paul.’ <br> <br> ‘And when are you sure?’ said the uncle, laughing. <br> <br> ‘Oh, well, sometimes I'm absolutely sure, like about Daffodil,’ said the boy; ‘and sometimes I have an idea; and sometimes I haven't even an idea, have I, Bassett? Then we're careful, because we mostly go down.’ <br> <br> ‘You do, do you! And when you're sure, like about Daffodil, what makes you sure, sonny?’ <br> <br> ‘Oh, well, I don't know,’ said the boy uneasily. ‘I'm sure, you know, uncle; that's all.’ <br> <br> ‘It's as if he had it from heaven, sir,’ Bassett reiterated. <br> <br> ‘I should say so!’ said the uncle. <br> <br> But he became a partner. And when the Leger was coming on Paul was 'sure' about Lively Spark, which was a quite inconsiderable horse. The boy insisted on putting a thousand on the horse, Bassett went for five hundred, and Oscar Cresswell two hundred. Lively Spark came in first, and the betting had been ten to one against him. Paul had made ten thousand. <br> <br> ‘You see,’ he said. ‘I was absolutely sure of him.’ <br> <br> Even Oscar Cresswell had cleared two thousand. <br> <br> ‘Look here, son,’ he said, ‘this sort of thing makes me nervous.’ <br> <br> ‘It needn't, uncle! Perhaps I shan't be sure again for a long time.’ <br> <br> ‘But what are you going to do with your money?’ asked the uncle. <br> <br> ‘Of course,’ said the boy, ‘I started it for mother. She said she had no luck, because father is unlucky, so I thought if I was lucky, it might stop whispering.’ <br> <br> ‘What might stop whispering?’ <br> <br> ‘Our house. I hate our house for whispering.’ <br> <br> ‘What does it whisper?’ <br> <br> ‘Why - why’ - the boy fidgeted - ‘why, I don't know. But it's always short of money, you know, uncle.’ <br> <br> ‘I know it, son, I know it.’ <br> <br> ‘You know people send mother writs, don't you, uncle?’ <br> <br> ‘I'm afraid I do,’ said the uncle. <br> <br> ‘And then the house whispers, like people laughing at you behind your back. It's awful, that is! I thought if I was lucky -’ <br> <br> ‘You might stop it,’ added the uncle. <br> <br> The boy watched him with big blue eyes, that had an uncanny cold fire in them, and he said never a word. <br> <br> ‘Well, then!’ said the uncle. ‘What are we doing?’ <br> <br> ‘I shouldn't like mother to know I was lucky,’ said the boy. <br> <br> ‘Why not, son?’ <br> <br> ‘She'd stop me.’ <br> <br> ‘I don't think she would.’ <br> <br> ‘Oh!’ - and the boy writhed in an odd way - ‘I don't want her to know, uncle.’ <br> <br> ‘All right, son! We'll manage it without her knowing.’ <br> <br> They managed it very easily. Paul, at the other's suggestion, handed over five thousand pounds to his uncle, who deposited it with the family lawyer, who was then to inform Paul's mother that a relative had put five thousand pounds into his hands, which sum was to be paid out a thousand pounds at a time, on the mother's birthday, for the next five years. <br> <br> ‘So she'll have a birthday present of a thousand pounds for five successive years,’ said Uncle Oscar. ‘I hope it won't make it all the harder for her later.’ <br> <br> Paul's mother had her birthday in November. The house had been 'whispering' worse than ever lately, and, even in spite of his luck, Paul could not bear up against it. He was very anxious to see the effect of the birthday letter, telling his mother about the thousand pounds. <br> <br> When there were no visitors, Paul now took his meals with his parents, as he was beyond the nursery control. His mother went into town nearly every day. She had discovered that she had an odd knack of sketching furs and dress materials, so she worked secretly in the studio of a friend who was the chief 'artist' for the leading drapers. She drew the figures of ladies in furs and ladies in silk and sequins for the newspaper advertisements. This young woman artist earned several thousand pounds a year, but Paul's mother only made several hundreds, and she was again dissatisfied. She so wanted to be first in something, and she did not succeed, even in making sketches for drapery advertisements. <br> <br> She was down to breakfast on the morning of her birthday. Paul watched her face as she read her letters. He knew the lawyer's letter. As his mother read it, her face hardened and became more expressionless. Then a cold, determined look came on her mouth. She hid the letter under the pile of others, and said not a word about it. <br> <br> ‘Didn't you have anything nice in the post for your birthday, mother?’ said Paul. <br> <br> ‘Quite moderately nice,’ she said, her voice cold and hard and absent. <br> <br> She went away to town without saying more. <br> <br> But in the afternoon Uncle Oscar appeared. He said Paul's mother had had a long interview with the lawyer, asking if the whole five thousand could not be advanced at once, as she was in debt. <br> <br> ‘What do you think, uncle?’ said the boy. <br> <br> ‘I leave it to you, son.’ <br> <br> ‘Oh, let her have it, then! We can get some more with the other,’ said the boy. <br> <br> ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, laddie!’ said Uncle Oscar. <br> <br> ‘But I'm sure to know for the Grand National; or the Lincolnshire; or else the Derby. I'm sure to know for one of them,’ said Paul. <br> <br> So Uncle Oscar signed the agreement, and Paul's mother touched the whole five thousand. Then something very curious happened. The voices in the house suddenly went mad, like a chorus of frogs on a spring evening. There were certain new furnishings, and Paul had a tutor. He was really going to Eton, his father's school, in the following autumn. There were flowers in the winter, and a blossoming of the luxury Paul's mother had been used to. And yet the voices in the house, behind the sprays of mimosa and almond-blossom, and from under the piles of iridescent cushions, simply trilled and screamed in a sort of ecstasy: ‘There must be more money! Oh-h-h; there must be more money. Oh, now, now-w! Now-w-w - there must be more money! - more than ever! More than ever!’ <br> <br> It frightened Paul terribly. He studied away at his Latin and Greek with his tutor. But his intense hours were spent with Bassett. The Grand National had gone by: he had not 'known', and had lost a hundred pounds. Summer was at hand. He was in agony for the Lincoln. But even for the Lincoln he didn't 'know', and he lost fifty pounds. He became wild-eyed and strange, as if something were going to explode in him. <br> <br> ‘Let it alone, son! Don't you bother about it!’ urged Uncle Oscar. But it was as if the boy couldn't really hear what his uncle was saying. <br> <br> ‘I've got to know for the Derby! I've got to know for the Derby!’ the child reiterated, his big blue eyes blazing with a sort of madness. <br> <br> His mother noticed how overwrought he was. <br> <br> ‘You'd better go to the seaside. Wouldn't you like to go now to the seaside, instead of waiting? I think you'd better,’ she said, looking down at him anxiously, her heart curiously heavy because of him. <br> <br> But the child lifted his uncanny blue eyes. <br> <br> ‘I couldn't possibly go before the Derby, mother!’ he said. ‘I couldn't possibly!’ <br> <br> ‘Why not?’ she said, her voice becoming heavy when she was opposed. ‘Why not? You can still go from the seaside to see the Derby with your Uncle Oscar, if that that's what you wish. No need for you to wait here. Besides, I think you care too much about these races. It's a bad sign. My family has been a gambling family, and you won't know till you grow up how much damage it has done. But it has done damage. I shall have to send Bassett away, and ask Uncle Oscar not to talk racing to you, unless you promise to be reasonable about it: go away to the seaside and forget it. You're all nerves!’ <br> <br> ‘I'll do what you like, mother, so long as you don't send me away till after the Derby,’ the boy said. <br> <br> ‘Send you away from where? Just from this house?’ <br> <br> ‘Yes,’ he said, gazing at her. <br> <br> ‘Why, you curious child, what makes you care about this house so much, suddenly? I never knew you loved it.’ <br> <br> He gazed at her without speaking. He had a secret within a secret, something he had not divulged, even to Bassett or to his Uncle Oscar. <br> <br> But his mother, after standing undecided and a little bit sullen for some moments, said: ‘Very well, then! Don't go to the seaside till after the Derby, if you don't wish it. But promise me you won't think so much about horse-racing and events as you call them!’ <br> <br> ‘Oh no,’ said the boy casually. ‘I won't think much about them, mother. You needn't worry. I wouldn't worry, mother, if I were you.’ <br> <br> ‘If you were me and I were you,’ said his mother, ‘I wonder what we should do!’ <br> <br> ‘But you know you needn't worry, mother, don't you?’ the boy repeated. <br> <br> ‘I should be awfully glad to know it,’ she said wearily. <br> <br> ‘Oh, well, you can, you know. I mean, you ought to know you needn't worry,’ he insisted. <br> <br> ‘Ought I? Then I'll see about it,’ she said. <br> <br> Paul's secret of secrets was his wooden horse, that which had no name. Since he was emancipated from a nurse and a nursery-governess, he had had his rocking-horse removed to his own bedroom at the top of the house. <br> <br> ‘Surely you're too big for a rocking-horse!’ his mother had remonstrated. <br> <br> ‘Well, you see, mother, till I can have a real horse, I like to have some sort of animal about,’ had been his quaint answer. <br> <br> ‘Do you feel he keeps you company?’ she laughed. <br> <br> ‘Oh yes! He's very good, he always keeps me company, when I'm there,’ said Paul. <br> <br> So the horse, rather shabby, stood in an arrested prance in the boy's bedroom. <br> <br> The Derby was drawing near, and the boy grew more and more tense. He hardly heard what was spoken to him, he was very frail, and his eyes were really uncanny. His mother had sudden strange seizures of uneasiness about him. Sometimes, for half an hour, she would feel a sudden anxiety about him that was almost anguish. She wanted to rush to him at once, and know he was safe. <br> <br> Two nights before the Derby, she was at a big party in town, when one of her rushes of anxiety about her boy, her first-born, gripped her heart till she could hardly speak. She fought with the feeling, might and main, for she believed in common sense. But it was too strong. She had to leave the dance and go downstairs to telephone to the country. The children's nursery-governess was terribly surprised and startled at being rung up in the night. <br> <br> ‘Are the children all right, Miss Wilmot?’ <br> <br> ‘Oh yes, they are quite all right.’ <br> <br> ‘Master Paul? Is he all right?’ <br> <br> ‘He went to bed as right as a trivet. Shall I run up and look at him?’ <br> <br> ‘No,’ said Paul's mother reluctantly. ‘No! Don't trouble. It's all right. Don't sit up. We shall be home fairly soon.’ She did not want her son's privacy intruded upon. <br> <br> ‘Very good,’ said the governess. <br> <br> It was about one o'clock when Paul's mother and father drove up to their house. All was still. Paul's mother went to her room and slipped off her white fur cloak. She had told her maid not to wait up for her. She heard her husband downstairs, mixing a whisky and soda. <br> <br> And then, because of the strange anxiety at her heart, she stole upstairs to her son's room. Noiselessly she went along the upper corridor. Was there a faint noise? What was it? <br> <br> She stood, with arrested muscles, outside his door, listening. There was a strange, heavy, and yet not loud noise. Her heart stood still. It was a soundless noise, yet rushing and powerful. Something huge, in violent, hushed motion. What was it? What in God's name was it? She ought to know. She felt that she knew the noise. She knew what it was. <br> <br> Yet she could not place it. She couldn't say what it was. And on and on it went, like a madness. <br> <br> Softly, frozen with anxiety and fear, she turned the door-handle. <br> <br> The room was dark. Yet in the space near the window, she heard and saw something plunging to and fro. She gazed in fear and amazement. <br> <br> Then suddenly she switched on the light, and saw her son, in his green pyjamas, madly surging on the rocking-horse. The blaze of light suddenly lit him up, as he urged the wooden horse, and lit her up, as she stood, blonde, in her dress of pale green and crystal, in the doorway. <br> <br> ‘Paul!’ she cried. ‘Whatever are you doing?’ <br> <br> ‘It's Malabar!’ he screamed in a powerful, strange voice. ‘It's Malabar!’ <br> <br> His eyes blazed at her for one strange and senseless second, as he ceased urging his wooden horse. Then he fell with a crash to the ground, and she, all her tormented motherhood flooding upon her, rushed to gather him up. <br> <br> But he was unconscious, and unconscious he remained, with some brain-fever. He talked and tossed, and his mother sat stonily by his side. <br> <br> ‘Malabar! It's Malabar! Bassett, Bassett, I know! It's Malabar!’ <br> <br> So the child cried, trying to get up and urge the rocking-horse that gave him his inspiration. <br> <br> ‘What does he mean by Malabar?’ asked the heart-frozen mother. <br> <br> ‘I don't know,’ said the father stonily. <br> <br> ‘What does he mean by Malabar?’ she asked her brother Oscar. <br> <br> ‘It's one of the horses running for the Derby,’ was the answer. <br> <br> And, in spite of himself, Oscar Cresswell spoke to Bassett, and himself put a thousand on Malabar: at fourteen to one. <br> <br> The third day of the illness was critical: they were waiting for a change. The boy, with his rather long, curly hair, was tossing ceaselessly on the pillow. He neither slept nor regained consciousness, and his eyes were like blue stones. His mother sat, feeling her heart had gone, turned actually into a stone. <br> <br> In the evening Oscar Cresswell did not come, but Bassett sent a message, saying could he come up for one moment, just one moment? Paul's mother was very angry at the intrusion, but on second thoughts she agreed. The boy was the same. Perhaps Bassett might bring him to consciousness. <br> <br> The gardener, a shortish fellow with a little brown moustache and sharp little brown eyes, tiptoed into the room, touched his imaginary cap to Paul's mother, and stole to the bedside, staring with glittering, smallish eyes at the tossing, dying child. <br> <br> ‘Master Paul!’ he whispered. ‘Master Paul! Malabar came in first all right, a clean win. I did as you told me. You've made over seventy thousand pounds, you have; you've got over eighty thousand. Malabar came in all right, Master Paul.’ <br> <br> ‘Malabar! Malabar! Did I say Malabar, mother? Did I say Malabar? Do you think I'm lucky, mother? I knew Malabar, didn't I? Over eighty thousand pounds! I call that lucky, don't you, mother? Over eighty thousand pounds! I knew, didn't I know I knew? Malabar came in all right. If I ride my horse till I'm sure, then I tell you, Bassett, you can go as high as you like. Did you go for all you were worth, Bassett?’ <br> <br> ‘I went a thousand on it, Master Paul.’ <br> <br> ‘I never told you, mother, that if I can ride my horse, and get there, then I'm absolutely sure - oh, absolutely! Mother, did I ever tell you? I am lucky!’ <br> <br> ‘No, you never did,’ said his mother. <br> <br> But the boy died in the night. <br> <br> And even as he lay dead, his mother heard her brother's voice saying to her, ‘My God, Hester, you're eighty-odd thousand to the good, and a poor devil of a son to the bad. But, poor devil, poor devil, he's best gone out of a life where he rides his rocking-horse to find a winner.’</p><br>To her father, she was The Princess. To her Boston aunts and uncles she was just ‘Dollie Urquhart, poor little thing.’<br><br>Colin Urquhart was just a bit mad. He was of an old Scottish family, and he claimed royal blood. The blood of Scottish kings flowed in his veins. On this point, his American relatives said, he was just a bit ‘off’. They could not bear any more to be told which royal blood of Scotland blued his veins. The whole thing was rather ridiculous, and a sore point. The only fact they remembered was that it was not Stuart.<br><br>He was a handsome man, with a wide-open blue eye that seemed sometimes to be looking at nothing, soft black hair brushed rather low on his low, broad brow, and a very attractive body. Add to this a most beautiful speaking voice, usually rather hushed and diffident, but sometimes resonant and powerful like bronze, and you have the sum of his charms. He looked like some old Celtic hero. He looked as if he should have worn a greyish kilt and a sporran, and shown his knees. His voice came direct out of the hushed Ossianic past.<br><br>For the rest, he was one of those gentlemen of sufficient but not excessive means who fifty years ago wandered vaguely about, never arriving anywhere, never doing anything, and never definitely being anything, yet well received in the good society of more than one country.<br><br>He did not marry till he was nearly forty, and then it was a wealthy Miss Prescott, from New England. Hannah Prescott at twenty-two was fascinated by the man with the soft black hair not yet touched by grey, and the wide, rather vague blue eyes. Many women had been fascinated before her. But Colin Urquhart, by his very vagueness, had avoided any decisive connection.<br><br>Mrs. Urquhart lived three years in the mist and glamour of her husband's presence. And then it broke her. It was like living with a fascinating spectre. About most things he was completely, even ghostly oblivious. He was always charming, courteous, perfectly gracious in that hushed, musical voice of his. But absent. When all came to all, he just wasn't there. ‘Not all there,’ as the vulgar say.<br><br>He was the father of the little girl she bore at the end of the first year. But this did not substantiate him the more. His very beauty and his haunting musical quality became dreadful to her after the first few months. The strange echo: he was like a living echo! His very flesh, when you touched it, did not seem quite the flesh of a real man.<br><br>Perhaps it was that he was a little bit mad. She thought it definitely the night her baby was born.<br><br>‘Ah, so my little princess has come at last!’ he said, in his throaty, singing Celtic voice, like a glad chant, swaying absorbed.<br><br>It was a tiny, frail baby, with wide, amazed blue eyes. They christened it Mary Henrietta. She called the little thing My Dollie. He called it always My Princess.<br><br>It was useless to fly at him. He just opened his wide blue eyes wider, and took a child-like, silent dignity there was no getting past.<br><br>Hannah Prescott had never been robust. She had no great desire to live. So when the baby was two years old she suddenly died.<br><br>The Prescotts felt a deep but unadmitted resentment against Colin Urquhart. They said he was selfish. Therefore they discontinued Hannah's income, a month after her burial in Florence, after they had urged the father to give the child over to them, and he had courteously, musically, but quite finally refused. He treated the Prescotts as if they were not of his world, not realities to him: just casual phenomena, or gramophones, talking-machines that had to be answered. He answered them. But of their actual existence he was never once aware.<br><br>They debated having him certified unsuitable to be guardian of his own child. But that would have created a scandal. So they did the simplest thing, after all—washed their hands of him. But they wrote scrupulously to the child, and sent her modest presents of money at Christmas, and on the anniversary of the death of her mother.<br><br>To The Princess her Boston relatives were for many years just a nominal reality. She lived with her father, and he travelled continually, though in a modest way, living on his moderate income. And never going to America. The child changed nurses all the time. In Italy it was a contadina; in India she had an ayah; in Germany she had a yellow-haired peasant girl.<br><br>Father and child were inseparable. He was not a recluse. Wherever he went he was to be seen paying formal calls going out to luncheon or to tea, rarely to dinner. And always with the child. People called her Princess Urquhart, as if that were her christened name.<br><br>She was a quick, dainty little thing with dark gold hair that went a soft brown, and wide, slightly prominent blue eyes that were at once so candid and so knowing. She was always grown up; she never really grew up. Always strangely wise, and always childish.<br><br>It was her father's fault.<br><br>‘My little Princess must never take too much notice of people and the things they say and do,’ he repeated to her. ‘People don't know what they are doing and saying. They chatter-chatter, and they hurt one another, and they hurt themselves very often, till they cry. But don't take any notice, my little Princess. Because it is all nothing. Inside everybody there is another creature, a demon which doesn't care at all. You peel away all the things they say and do and feel, as cook peels away the outside of the onions. And in the middle of everybody there is a green demon which you can't peel away. And this green demon never changes, and it doesn't care at all about all the things that happen to the outside leaves of the person, all the chatter-chatter, and all the husbands and wives and children, and troubles and fusses. You peel everything away from people, and there is a green, upright demon in every man and woman; and this demon is a man's real self, and a woman's real self. It doesn't really care about anybody, it belongs to the demons and the primitive fairies, who never care. But, even so, there are big demons and mean demons, and splendid demonish fairies, and vulgar ones. But there are no royal fairy women left. Only you, my little Princess. You are the last of the royal race of the old people; the last, my Princess. There are no others. You and I are the last. When I am dead there will be only you. And that is why, darling, you will never care for any of the people in the world very much. Because their demons are all dwindled and vulgar. They are not royal. Only you are royal, after me. Always remember that. And always remember, it is a great secret. If you tell people, they will try to kill you, because they will envy you for being a Princess. It is our great secret, darling. I am a prince, and you a princess, of the old, old blood. And we keep our secret between us, all alone. And so, darling, you must treat all people very politely, because noblesse oblige. But you must never forget that you alone are the last of Princesses, and that all other are less than you are, less noble, more vulgar. Treat them politely and gently and kindly, darling. But you are the Princess, and they are commoners. Never try to think of them as if they were like you. They are not. You will find, always, that they are lacking, lacking in the royal touch, which only you have—’<br><br>The Princess learned her lesson early—the first lesson, of absolute reticence, the impossibility of intimacy with any other than her father; the second lesson, of naïve, slightly benevolent politeness. As a small child, something crystallised in her character, making her clear and finished, and as impervious as crystal.<br><br>‘Dear child!’ her hostesses said of her. ‘She is so quaint and old-fashioned; such a lady, poor little mite!’<br><br>She was erect, and very dainty. Always small, nearly tiny in physique, she seemed like a changeling beside her big, handsome, slightly mad father. She dressed very simply, usually in blue or delicate greys, with little collars of old Milan point, or very finely-worked linen. She had exquisite little hands, that made the piano sound like a spinet when she played. She was rather given to wearing cloaks and capes, instead of coats, out of doors, and little eighteenth-century sort of hats. Her complexion was pure apple-blossom.<br><br>She looked as if she had stepped out of a picture. But no one, to her dying day, ever knew exactly the strange picture her father had framed her in and from which she never stepped.<br><br>Her grandfather and grandmother and her Aunt Maud demanded twice to see her, once in Rome and once in Paris. Each time they were charmed, piqued, and annoyed. She was so exquisite and such a little virgin. At the same time so knowing and so oddly assured. That odd, assured touch of condescension, and the inward coldness, infuriated her American relations.<br><br>Only she really fascinated her grandfather. He was spellbound; in a way, in love with the little faultless thing. His wife would catch him brooding, musing over his grandchild, long months after the meeting, and craving to see her again. He cherished to the end the fond hope that she might come to live with him and her grandmother.<br><br>‘Thank you so much, grandfather. You are so very kind. But Papa and I are such an old couple, you see, such a crochety old couple, living in a world of our own.’<br><br>Her father let her see the world—from the outside. And he let her read. When she was in her teens she read Zola and Maupassant, and with the eyes of Zola and Maupassant she looked on Paris. A little later she read Tolstoi and Dostoevsky. The latter confused her. The others, she seemed to understand with a very shrewd, canny understanding, just as she understood the Decameron stories as she read them in their old Italian, or the Nibelung poems. Strange and uncanny, she seemed to understand things in a cold light perfectly, with all the flush of fire absent. She was something like a changeling, not quite human.<br><br>This earned her, also, strange antipathies. Cabmen and railway porters, especially in Paris and Rome, would suddenly treat her with brutal rudeness, when she was alone. They seemed to look on her with sudden violent antipathy. They sensed in her curious impertinence, an easy, sterile impertinence towards the things they felt most. She was so assured, and her flower of maidenhood was so scentless. She could look at a lusty, sensual Roman cabman as if he were a sort of grotesque, to make her smile. She knew all about him, in Zola. And the peculiar condescension with which she would give him her order, as if she, frail, beautiful thing, were the only reality, and he, coarse monster, was a sort of Caliban floundering in the mud on the margin of the pool of the perfect lotus, would suddenly enrage the fellow, the real Mediterranean who prided himself on his beauté male, and to whom the phallic mystery was still the only mystery. And he would turn a terrible face on her, bully her in a brutal, coarse fashion—hideous. For to him she had only the blasphemous impertinence of her own sterility.<br><br>Encounters like these made her tremble, and made her know she must have support from the outside. The power of her spirit did not extend to these low people, and they had all the physical power. She realised an implacability of hatred in their turning on her. But she did not lose her head. She quietly paid out money and turned away.<br><br>Those were dangerous moments, though, and she learned to be prepared for them. The Princess she was, and the fairy from the North, and could never understand the volcanic phallic rage with which coarse people could turn on her in a paroxysm of hatred. They never turned on her father like that. And quite early she decided it was the New England mother in her whom they hated. Never for one minute could she see with the old Roman eyes, see herself as sterility, the barren flower taking on airs and an intolerable impertinence. This was what the Roman cabman saw in her. And he longed to crush the barren blossom. Its sexless beauty and its authority put him in a passion of brutal revolt.<br><br>When she was nineteen her grandfather died, leaving her a considerable fortune in the safe hands of responsible trustees. They would deliver her her income, but only on condition that she resided for six months in the year in the United States.<br><br>‘Why should they make me conditions?’ she said to her father. ‘I refuse to be imprisoned six months in the year in the United States. We will tell them to keep their money.’<br><br>‘Let us be wise, my little Princess, let us be wise. No, we are almost poor, and we are never safe from rudeness. I cannot allow anybody to be rude to me. I hate it, I hate it!’ His eyes flamed as he said it. ‘I could kill any man or woman who is rude to me. But we are in exile in the world. We are powerless. If we were really poor, we should be quite powerless, and then I should die. No, my Princess. Let us take their money, then they will not dare to be rude to us. Let us take it, as we put on clothes, to cover ourselves from their aggressions.’<br><br>There began a new phase, when the father and daughter spent their summers on the Great Lakes or in California, or in the South-West. The father was something of a poet, the daughter something of a painter. He wrote poems about the lakes or the redwood trees, and she made dainty drawings. He was physically a strong man, and he loved the out-of-doors. He would go off with her for days, paddling in a canoe and sleeping by a camp-fire. Frail little Princess, she was always undaunted, always undaunted. She would ride with him on horseback over the mountain trails till she was so tired she was nothing but a bodiless consciousness sitting astride her pony. But she never gave in. And at night he folded her in her blanket on a bed of balsam pine twigs, and she lay and looked at the stars unmurmuring. She was fulfilling her rôle.<br><br>People said to her as the years passed, and she was a woman of twenty-five, then a woman of thirty, and always the same virgin dainty Princess, 'knowing' in a dispassionate way, like an old woman, and utterly intact:<br><br>‘Don't you ever think what you will do when your father is no longer with you?’<br><br>She looked at her interlocutor with that cold, elfin detachment of hers:<br><br>‘No, I never think of it,’ she said.<br><br>She had a tiny, but exquisite little house in London, and another small, perfect house in Connecticut, each with a faithful housekeeper. Two homes, if she chose. And she knew many interesting literary and artistic people. What more?<br><br>So the years passed imperceptibly. And she had that quality of the sexless fairies, she did not change. At thirty-three she looked twenty-three.<br><br>Her father, however, was ageing, and becoming more and more queer. It was now her task to be his guardian in his private madness. He spent the last three years of life in the house in Connecticut. He was very much estranged, sometimes had fits of violence which almost killed the little Princess. Physical violence was horrible to her; it seemed to shatter her heart. But she found a woman a few years younger than herself, well-educated and sensitive, to be a sort of nurse-companion to the mad old man. So the fact of madness was never openly admitted. Miss Cummins, the companion, had a passionate loyalty to the Princess, and a curious affection, tinged with love, for the handsome, white-haired, courteous old man, who was never at all aware of his fits of violence once they had passed.<br><br>The Princess was thirty-eight years old when her father died. And quite unchanged. She was still tiny, and like a dignified, scentless flower. Her soft brownish hair, almost the colour of beaver fur, was bobbed, and fluffed softly round her apple-blossom face, that was modelled with an arched nose like a proud old Florentine portrait. In her voice, manner and bearing she was exceedingly still, like a flower that has blossomed in a shadowy place. And from her blue eyes looked out the Princess's eternal laconic challenge, that grew almost sardonic as the years passed. She was the Princess, and sardonically she looked out on a princeless world.<br><br>She was relieved when her father died, and at the same time, it was as if everything had evaporated around her. She had lived in a sort of hot-house, in the aura of her father's madness. Suddenly the hot-house had been removed from around her, and she was in the raw, vast, vulgar open air.<br><br>Quoi faire? What was she to do? She seemed faced with absolute nothingness. Only she had Miss Cummins, who shared with her the secret, and almost the passion for her father. In fact, the Princess felt that her passion for her mad father had in some curious way transferred itself largely to Charlotte Cummins during the last years. And now Miss Cummins was the vessel that held the passion for the dead man. She herself, the Princess, was an empty vessel.<br><br>An empty vessel in the enormous warehouse of the world.<br><br>Quoi faire? What was she to do? She felt that, since she could not evaporate into nothingness, like alcohol from an unstoppered bottle, she must do something. Never before in her life had she felt the incumbency. Never, never had she felt she must do anything. That was left to the vulgar.<br><br>Now her father was dead, she found herself on the fringe of the vulgar crowd, sharing their necessity to do something. It was a little humiliating. She felt herself becoming vulgarised. At the same time she found herself looking at men with a shrewder eye: an eye to marriage. Not that she felt any sudden interest in men, or attraction towards them. No. She was still neither interested nor attracted towards men vitally. But marriage, that peculiar abstraction, had imposed a sort of spell on her. She thought that marriage, in the blank abstract, was the thing she ought to do. That marriage implied a man she also knew. She knew all the facts. But the man seemed a property of her own mind rather than a thing in himself, another thing.<br><br>Her father died in the summer, the month after her thirty-eighth birthday. When all was over, the obvious thing to do, of course, was to travel. With Miss Cummins. The two women knew each other intimately, but they were always Miss Urquhart and Miss Cummins to one another, and a certain distance was instinctively maintained. Miss Cummins, from Philadelphia, of scholastic stock, and intelligent but untravelled, four years younger than the Princess, felt herself immensely the junior of her 'lady'. She had a sort of passionate veneration for the Princess, who seemed to her ageless, timeless. She could not see the rows of tiny, dainty, exquisite shoes in the Princess's cupboard without feeling a stab at the heart, a stab of tenderness and reverence, almost of awe.<br><br>Miss Cummins also was virginal, but with a look of puzzled surprise in her brown eyes. Her skin was pale and clear, her features well modelled, but there was a certain blankness in her expression, where the Princess had an odd touch of Renaissance grandeur. Miss Cummins's voice was also hushed almost to a whisper; it was the inevitable effect of Colin Urquhart's room. But the hushedness had a hoarse quality.<br><br>The Princess did not want to go to Europe. Her face seemed turned west. Now her father was gone, she felt she would go west, westwards, as if for ever. Following, no doubt, the March of Empire, which is brought up rather short on the Pacific coast, among swarms of wallowing bathers.<br><br>No, not the Pacific coast. She would stop short of that. The South-West was less vulgar. She would go to New Mexico.<br><br>She and Miss Cummins arrived at the Rancho del Cerro Gordo towards the end of August, when the crowd was beginning to drift back east. The ranch lay by a stream on the desert some four miles from the foot of the mountains, a mile away from the Indian pueblo of San Cristobal. It was a ranch for the rich; the Princess paid thirty dollars a day for herself and Miss Cummins. But then she had a little cottage to herself, among the apple trees of the orchard, with an excellent cook. She and Miss Cummins, however, took dinner at evening in the large guest-house. For the Princess still entertained the idea of marriage.<br><br>The guests at the Rancho del Cerro Gordo were of all sorts, except the poor sort. They were practically all rich, and many were romantic. Some were charming, others were vulgar, some were movie people, quite quaint and not unattractive in their vulgarity, and many were Jews. The Princess did not care for Jews, though they were usually the most interesting to talk to. So she talked a good deal with the Jews, and painted with the artists, and rode with the young men from college, and had altogether quite a good time. And yet she felt something of a fish out of water, or a bird in the wrong forest. And marriage remained still completely in the abstract. No connecting it with any of these young men, even the nice ones.<br><br>The Princess looked just twenty-five. The freshness of her mouth, the hushed, delicate-complexioned virginity of her face gave her not a day more. Only a certain laconic look in her eyes was disconcerting. When she was forced to write her age, she put twenty-eight, making the figure two rather badly, so that it just avoided being a three.<br><br>Men hinted marriage at her. Especially boys from college suggested it from a distance. But they all failed before the look of sardonic ridicule in the Princess's eyes. It always seemed to her rather preposterous, quite ridiculous, and a tiny bit impertinent on their part.<br><br>The only man that intrigued her at all was one of the guides, a man called Romero—Domingo Romero. It was he who had sold the ranch itself to the Wilkiesons, ten years before, for two thousand dollars. He had gone away, then reappeared at the old place. For he was the son of the old Romero, the last of the Spanish family that had owned miles of land around San Cristobal. But the coming of the white man and the failure of the vast flocks of sheep, and the fatal inertia which overcomes all men, at last, on the desert near the mountains, had finished the Romero family. The last descendants were just Mexican peasants.<br><br>Domingo, the heir, had spent his two thousand dollars, and was working for white people. He was now about thirty years old, a tall, silent fellow, with a heavy closed mouth and black eyes that looked across at one almost sullenly. From behind he was handsome, with a strong, natural body, and the back of his neck very dark and well-shapen, strong with life. But his dark face was long and heavy, almost sinister, with that peculiar heavy meaninglessness in it, characteristic of the Mexicans of his own locality. They are strong, they seem healthy. They laugh and joke with one another. But their physique and their natures seem static, as if there were nowhere, nowhere at all for their energies to go, and their faces, degenerating to misshapen heaviness, seem to have no raison d'être, no radical meaning. Waiting either to die or to be aroused into passion and hope. In some of the black eyes a queer, haunting mystic quality, sombre and a bit gruesome, the skull-and-cross-bones look of the Penitentes. They had found their raison d'être in self-torture and death-worship. Unable to wrest a positive significance for themselves from the vast, beautiful, but vindictive landscape they were born into, they turned on their own selves, and worshipped death through self-torture. The mystic gloom of this showed in their eyes.<br><br>But as a rule the dark eyes of the Mexicans were heavy and half alive, sometimes hostile, sometimes kindly, often with the fatal Indian glaze on them, or the fatal Indian glint.<br><br>Domingo Romero was almost a typical Mexican to look at, with the typical heavy, dark, long face, clean-shaven, with an almost brutally heavy mouth. His eyes were black and Indian-looking. Only, at the centre of their hopelessness was a spark of pride, or self-confidence, or dauntlessness. Just a spark in the midst of the blackness of static despair.<br><br>But this spark was the difference between him and the mass of men. It gave a certain alert sensitiveness to his bearing and a certain beauty to his appearance. He wore a low-crowned black hat, instead of the ponderous headgear of the usual Mexican, and his clothes were thinnish and graceful. Silent, aloof, almost imperceptible in the landscape, he was an admirable guide, with a startling quick intelligence that anticipated difficulties about to rise. He could cook, too, crouching over the camp-fire and moving his lean deft brown hands. The only fault he had was that he was not forthcoming, he wasn't chatty and cosy.<br><br>‘Oh, don't send Romero with us,’ the Jews would say. ‘One can't get any response from him.’<br><br>Tourists come and go, but they rarely see anything, inwardly. None of them ever saw the spark at the middle of Romero's eye; they were not alive enough to see it.<br><br>The Princess caught it one day, when she had him for a guide. She was fishing for trout in the canyon, Miss Cummins was reading a book, the horses were tied under the trees, Romero was fixing a proper fly on her line. He fixed the fly and handed her the line, looking up at her. And at that moment she caught the spark in his eye. And instantly she knew that he was a gentleman, that his 'demon', as her father would have said, was a fine demon. And instantly her manner towards him changed.<br><br>He had perched her on a rock over a quiet pool, beyond the cotton-wood trees. It was early September, and the canyon already cool, but the leaves of the cottonwoods were still green. The Princess stood on her rock, a small but perfectly-formed figure, wearing a soft, close grey sweater and neatly-cut grey riding-breeches, with tall black boots, her fluffy brown hair straggling from under a little grey felt hat. A woman? Not quite. A changeling of some sort, perched in outline there on the rock, in the bristling wild canyon. She knew perfectly well how to handle a line. Her father had made a fisherman of her.<br><br>Romero, in a black shirt and with loose black trousers pushed into wide black riding-boots, was fishing a little farther down. He had put his hat on a rock behind him; his dark head was bent a little forward, watching the water. He had caught three trout. From time to time he glanced up-stream at the Princess, perched there so daintily. He saw she had caught nothing.<br><br>Soon he quietly drew in his line and came up to her. His keen eye watched her line, watched her position. Then, quietly, he suggested certain changes to her, putting his sensitive brown hand before her. And he withdrew a little, and stood in silence, leaning against a tree, watching her. He was helping her across the distance. She knew it, and thrilled. And in a moment she had a bite. In two minutes she landed a good trout. She looked round at him quickly, her eyes sparkling, the colour heightened in her cheeks. And as she met his eyes a smile of greeting went over his dark face, very sudden, with an odd sweetness.<br><br>She knew he was helping her. And she felt in his presence a subtle, insidious male kindliness she had never known before waiting upon her. Her cheek flushed, and her blue eyes darkened.<br><br>After this, she always looked for him, and for that curious dark beam of a man's kindliness which he could give her, as it were, from his chest, from his heart. It was something she had never known before.<br><br>A vague, unspoken intimacy grew up between them. She liked his voice, his appearance, his presence. His natural language was Spanish; he spoke English like a foreign language, rather slow, with a slight hesitation, but with a sad, plangent sonority lingering over from his Spanish. There was a certain subtle correctness in his appearance; he was always perfectly shaved; his hair was thick and rather long on top, but always carefully groomed behind. And his fine black cashmere shirt, his wide leather belt, his well-cut, wide black trousers going into the embroidered cowboy boots had a certain inextinguishable elegance. He wore no silver rings or buckles. Only his boots were embroidered and decorated at the top with an inlay of white suède. He seemed elegant, slender, yet he was very strong.<br><br>And at the same time, curiously, he gave her the feeling that death was not far from him. Perhaps he too was half in love with death. However that may be, the sense she had that death was not far from him made him 'possible' to her.<br><br>Small as she was, she was quite a good horsewoman. They gave her at the ranch a sorrel mare, very lovely in colour, and well-made, with a powerful broad neck and the hollow back that betokens a swift runner. Tansy, she was called. Her only fault was the usual mare's failing, she was inclined to be hysterical.<br><br>So that every day the Princess set off with Miss Cummins and Romero, on horseback, riding into the mountains. Once they went camping for several days, with two more friends in the party.<br><br>‘I think I like it better,’ the Princess said to Romero, ‘when we three go alone.’<br><br>And he gave her one of his quick, transfiguring smiles.<br><br>It was curious no white man had ever showed her this capacity for subtle gentleness, this power to help her in silence across a distance, if she were fishing without success, or tired of her horse, or if Tansy suddenly got scared. It was as if Romero could send her from his heart a dark beam of succour and sustaining. She had never known this before, and it was very thrilling.<br><br>Then the smile that suddenly creased his dark face, showing the strong white teeth. It creased his face almost into a savage grotesque. And at the same time there was in it something so warm, such a dark flame of kindliness for her, she was elated into her true Princess self.<br><br>Then that vivid, latent spark in his eye, which she had seen, and which she knew he was aware she had seen. It made an inter-recognition between them, silent and delicate. Here he was delicate as a woman in this subtle inter-recognition.<br><br>And yet his presence only put to flight in her the idée fixe of 'marriage'. For some reason, in her strange little brain, the idea of marrying him could not enter. Not for any definite reason. He was in himself a gentleman, and she had plenty of money for two. There was no actual obstacle. Nor was she conventional.<br><br>No, now she came down to it, it was as if their two 'dæmons' could marry, were perhaps married. Only their two selves, Miss Urquhart and Señor Domingo Romero, were for some reason incompatible. There was a peculiar subtle intimacy of inter-recognition between them. But she did not see in the least how it would lead to marriage. Almost she could more easily marry one of the nice boys from Harvard or Yale.<br><br>The time passed, and she let it pass. The end of September came, with aspens going yellow on the mountain heights, and oak-scrub going red. But as yet the cottonwoods in the valley and canyons had not changed.<br><br>‘When will you go away?’ Romero asked her, looking at her fixedly, with a blank black eye.<br><br>‘By the end of October,’ she said. ‘I have promised to be in Santa Barbara at the beginning of November.’<br><br>He was hiding the spark in his eye from her. But she saw the peculiar sullen thickening of his heavy mouth.<br><br>She had complained to him many times that one never saw any wild animals, except chipmunks and squirrels, and perhaps a skunk and a porcupine. Never a deer, or a bear, or a mountain lion.<br><br>‘Are there no bigger animals in these mountains?’ she asked, dissatisfied.<br><br>‘Yes,’ he said. ‘There are deer—I see their tracks. And I saw the tracks of a bear.’<br><br>‘But why can one never see the animals themselves?’ She looked dissatisfied and wistful like a child.<br><br>‘Why, it's pretty hard for you to see them. They won't let you come close. You have to keep still, in a place where they come. Or else you have to follow their tracks a long way.’<br><br>‘I can't bear to go away till I've seen them: a bear, or a deer—’<br><br>The smile came suddenly on his face, indulgent.<br><br>‘Well, what do you want? Do you want to go up into the mountains to some place, to wait till they come?’<br><br>‘Yes,’ she said, looking up at him with a sudden naïve impulse of recklessness.<br><br>And immediately his face became sombre again, responsible.<br><br>‘Well,’ he said, with slight irony, a touch of mockery of her. ‘You will have to find a house. It's very cold at night now. You would have to stay all night in a house.’<br><br>‘And there are no houses up there?’ she said.<br><br>‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘There is a little shack that belongs to me, that a miner built a long time ago, looking for gold. You can go there and stay one night, and maybe you see something. Maybe! I don't know. Maybe nothing come.’<br><br>‘How much chance is there?’<br><br>‘Well, I don't know. Last time when I was there I see three deer come down to drink at the water, and I shot two raccoons. But maybe this time we don't see anything.’<br><br>‘Is there water there?’ she asked.<br><br>‘Yes, there is a little round pond, you know, below the spruce trees. And the water from the snow runs into it.’<br><br>‘Is it far away?’ she asked.<br><br>‘Yes, pretty far. You see that ridge there’—and turning to the mountains he lifted his arm in the gesture which is somehow so moving, out in the West, pointing to the distance—’that ridge where there are no trees, only rock’—his black eyes were focussed on the distance, his face impassive, but as if in pain—’you go round that ridge, and along, then you come down through the spruce trees to where that cabin is. My father bought that placer claim from a miner who was broke, but nobody ever found any gold or anything, and nobody ever goes there. Too lonesome!’<br><br>The Princess watched the massive, heavy-sitting, beautiful bulk of the Rocky Mountains. It was early in October, and the aspens were already losing their gold leaves; high up, the spruce and pine seemed to be growing darker; the great flat patches of oak scrub on the heights were red like gore.<br><br>‘Can I go over there?’ she asked, turning to him and meeting the spark in his eye.<br><br>His face was heavy with responsibility.<br><br>‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you can go. But there'll be snow over the ridge, and it's awful cold, and awful lonesome.’<br><br>‘I should like to go,’ she said, persistent.<br><br>‘All right,’ he said. ‘You can go if you want to.’<br><br>She doubted, though, if the Wilkiesons would let her go; at least alone with Romero and Miss Cummins.<br><br>Yet an obstinacy characteristic of her nature, an obstinacy tinged perhaps with madness, had taken hold of her. She wanted to look over the mountains into their secret heart. She wanted to descend to the cabin below the spruce trees, near the tarn of bright green water. She wanted to see the wild animals move about in their wild unconsciousness.<br><br>‘Let us say to the Wilkiesons that we want to make the trip round the Frijoles canyon,’ she said.<br><br>The trip round the Frijoles canyon was a usual thing. It would not be strenuous, nor cold, nor lonely: they could sleep in the log house that was called an hotel.<br><br>Romero looked at her quickly.<br><br>‘If you want to say that,’ he replied, ‘you can tell Mrs. Wilkieson. Only I know she'll be mad with me if I take you up in the mountains to that place. And I've got to go there first with a pack-horse, to take lots of blankets and some bread. Maybe Miss Cummins can't stand it. Maybe not. It's a hard trip.’<br><br>He was speaking, and thinking, in the heavy, disconnected Mexican fashion.<br><br>‘Never mind!’ The Princess was suddenly very decisive and stiff with authority. ‘I want to do it. I will arrange with Mrs. Wilkieson. And we'll go on Saturday.’<br><br>He shook his head slowly.<br><br>‘I've got to go up on Sunday with a pack-horse and blankets,’ he said. ‘Can't do it before.’<br><br>‘Very well!’ she said, rather piqued. ‘Then we'll start on Monday.’<br><br>She hated being thwarted even the tiniest bit.<br><br>He knew that if he started with the pack on Sunday at dawn he would not be back until late at night. But he consented that they should start on Monday morning at seven. The obedient Miss Cummins was told to prepare for the Frijoles trip. On Sunday Romero had his day off. He had not put in an appearance when the Princess retired on Sunday night, but on Monday morning, as she was dressing, she saw him bringing in the three horses from the corral. She was in high spirits.<br><br>The night had been cold. There was ice at the edges of the irrigation ditch, and the chipmunks crawled into the sun and lay with wide, dumb, anxious eyes, almost too numb to run.<br><br>‘We may be away two or three days,’ said the Princess.<br><br>‘Very well. We won't begin to be anxious about you before Thursday, then,’ said Mrs. Wilkieson, who was young and capable: from Chicago. ‘Anyway,’ she added, ‘Romero will see you through. He's so trustworthy.’<br><br>The sun was already on the desert as they set off towards the mountains, making the greasewood and the sage pale as pale-grey sands, luminous the great level around them. To the right glinted the shadows of the adobe pueblo, flat and almost invisible on the plain, earth of its earth. Behind lay the ranch and the tufts of tall, plumy cottonwoods, whose summits were yellowing under the perfect blue sky.<br><br>Autumn breaking into colour in the great spaces of the South-West.<br><br>But the three trotted gently along the trail, towards the sun that sparkled yellow just above the dark bulk of the ponderous mountains. Side-slopes were already gleaming yellow, flaming with a second light, under coldish blue of the pale sky. The front slopes were in shadow, with submerged lustre of red oak scrub and dull-gold aspens, blue-black pines and grey-blue rock. While the canyon was full of a deep blueness.<br><br>They rode single file, Romero first, on a black horse. Himself in black, made a flickering black spot in the delicate pallor of the great landscape, where even pine trees at a distance take a film of blue paler than their green. Romero rode on in silence past the tufts of furry greasewood. The Princess came next, on her sorrel mare. And Miss Cummins, who was not quite happy on horseback, came last, in the pale dust that the others kicked up. Sometimes her horse sneezed, and she started.<br><br>But on they went at a gentle trot. Romero never looked round. He could hear the sound of the hoofs following, and that was all he wanted.<br><br>For the rest, he held ahead. And the Princess, with that black, unheeding figure always travelling away from her, felt strangely helpless, withal elated.<br><br>They neared the pale, round foot-hills, dotted with the round dark piñon and cedar shrubs. The horses clinked and trotted among the stones. Occasionally a big round greasewood held out fleecy tufts of flowers, pure gold. They wound into blue shadow, then up a steep stony slope, with the world lying pallid away behind and below. Then they dropped into the shadow of the San Cristobal canyon.<br><br>The stream was running full and swift. Occasionally the horses snatched at a tuft of grass. The trail narrowed and became rocky; the rocks closed in; it was dark and cool as the horses climbed and climbed upwards, and the tree trunks crowded in the shadowy, silent tightness of the canyon. They were among cottonwood trees that ran straight up and smooth and round to an extraordinary height. Above, the tips were gold, and it was sun. But away below, where the horses struggled up the rocks and wound among the trunks, there was still blue shadow by the sound of waters and an occasional grey festoon of [[W:en:Usnea|old man's beard"}
