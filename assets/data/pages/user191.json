"main_text":"Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem<br> our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight<br> hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which<br> comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and<br> when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn<br> moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still<br> larger cause of humanity.<br><br> At the dawn of history India started on her unending quest, and trackless centuries are filled with<br> her striving and the grandeur of her successes, and her failures. Through good and ill fortune<br> alike she has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals which gave her strength. We<br> end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate<br> today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that<br> await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the<br> challenge of the future ?<br><br> Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility rests upon this Assembly, a sovereign<br> body representing the sovereign people of India. Before the birth of freedom, we have endured<br> all the pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of this sorrow. Some of those<br> pains continue even now. Nevertheless, the past is over and it is the future that beckons to us<br> now. That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving so that we might fulfil the<br> pledges we have so often taken and the One we shall take today. The service of lndia means the<br> service of the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and<br> inequality of opportunity. The ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe<br> every tear from every eye. That may be beyond us but as long as there are tears and<br> suffering, so long our work will not be over.<br><br> And so we have to labour and to work and work hard to give reality to our dreams. Those<br> dreams are for India, but they are also for the world, for all the nations and peoples are too<br> closely knit together today for anyone of them to imagine that it can live apart.<br> Peace has been said to be indivisible; so is freedom, so is prosperity now, and so also is disaster<br> in this one world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments. To the people of India,<br> whose representatives we are, we appeal to join us' with faith and confidence in this great<br> adventure. This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for ill-will or blaming<br> others. We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell.<br><br> I beg to move, sir, that it be resolved that:<br> After the last stroke of midnight, all members of the Constituent Assembly present on this<br> occasion, do take the following pledge:<br> (1)At this solemn moment, when the people of India, through suffering and sacrifice, have<br> secured freedom, I a member of the Constituent Assembly of India, do dedicate myself in all<br> humility to the service of India and her people to the end that this ancient land attain her rightful<br> place in the world and make her full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and<br> the welfare of mankind.<br> (2)Members who are not present on this occasion do take the pledge (with such verbal changes<br> as the president may prescribe) at the time they next attend a session of the Assembly."}
