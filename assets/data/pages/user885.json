You listen with delight, <br><br> By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled. <br><br> You crown our distant ardours while we fight, <br><br> And mourn our laurelled memories when we're killed. <br><br> You can't believe that British troops 'retire' <br><br> When hell's last horror breaks them, and they run, <br><br> Trampling the terrible corpses--blind with blood. <br><br> O German mother dreaming by the fire, <br><br> While you are knitting socks to send your son <br><br> His face is trodden deeper in the mud.",
