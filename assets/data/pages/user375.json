				"main_text": "As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;<br>As tumbled over rim in roundy wells<br>Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's<br>Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;<br>Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:<br>Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;<br>Selves - goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,<br>Crying, What I do is me: for that I came.<br><br>I say more: the just man justices;<br>Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;<br>Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is - <br>Christ. For Christ plays in ten thousand places,<br>Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his<br>To the Father through the features of men's faces."
