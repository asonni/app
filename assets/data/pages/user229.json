In a pig's arse, friend.<br>Day comes to an end.<br>The gas fire breathes, the trees are darkly swayed.<br>And so Dear Warlock-Williams: I'm afraid -<br><br>Funny how hard it is to be alone.<br>I could spend half my evenings, if I wanted,<br>Holding a glass of washing sherry, canted<br>Over to catch the drivel of some bitch<br>Who's read nothing but Which;<br>Just think of all the spare time that has flown<br><br>Straight into nothingness by being filled<br>With forks and faces, rather than repaid<br>Under a lamp, hearing the noise of wind,<br>And looking out to see the moon thinned<br>To an air-sharpened blade.<br>A life, and yet how sternly it's instilled<br><br>All solitude is selfish. No one now<br>Believes the hermit with his gown and dish<br>Talking to God (who's gone too); the big wish<br>Is to have people nice to you, which means<br>Doing it back somehow.<br>Virtue is social. Are, then, these routines<br><br>Playing at goodness, like going to church?<br>Something that bores us, something we don't do well<br>(Asking that ass about his fool research)<br>But try to feel, because, however crudely,<br>It shows us what should be?<br>Too subtle, that. Too decent, too. Oh hell,<br><br>Only the young can be alone freely.<br>The time is shorter now for company,<br>And sitting by a lamp more often brings<br>Not peace, but other things.<br>Beyond the light stand failure and remorse<br>Whispering Dear Warlock-Williams: Why, of course -"
