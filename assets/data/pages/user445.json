				"main_text": "I wandered lonely as a cloud<br> That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br> When all at once I saw a crowd,<br> A host, of golden daffodils;<br> Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br> Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br><br> Continuous as the stars that shine<br> And twinkle on the milky way,<br> They stretched in never-ending line <br> Along the margin of a bay:<br> Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br> Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br><br> The waves beside them danced; but they<br> Out-did the sparkling waves in glee;<br> A poet could not but be gay,<br> In such a jocund company;<br> I gazed-and gazed-but little thought<br> What wealth the show to me had brought:<br><br> For oft, when on my couch I lie<br> In vacant or in pensive mood,<br> They flash upon that inward eye<br> Which is the bliss of solitude;<br> And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br> And dances with the daffodils."
