				"main_text": "A music-stand of crimson lacquer, long since brought<br>In some fast clipper-ship from China, quaintly wrought<br>With bossed and carven flowers and fruits in blackening gold,<br>The slender shaft all twined about and thickly scrolled<br>With vine leaves and young twisted tendrils, whirling, curling,<br>Flinging their new shoots over the four wings, and swirling<br>Out on the three wide feet in golden lumps and streams;<br>Petals and apples in high relief, and where the seams<br>Are worn with handling, through the polished crimson sheen,<br>Long streaks of black, the under lacquer, shine out clean.<br>Four desks, adjustable, to suit the heights of players<br>Sitting to viols or standing up to sing, four layers<br>Of music to serve every instrument, are there,<br>And on the apex a large flat-topped golden pear.<br>It burns in red and yellow, dusty, smouldering lights,<br>When the sun flares the old barn-chamber with its flights<br>And skips upon the crystal knobs of dim sideboards,<br>Legless and mouldy, and hops, glint to glint, on hoards<br>Of scythes, and spades, and dinner-horns, so the old tools<br>Are little candles throwing brightness round in pools.<br>With Oriental splendour, red and gold, the dust<br>Covering its flames like smoke and thinning as a gust<br>Of brighter sunshine makes the colours leap and range,<br>The strange old music-stand seems to strike out and change;<br>To stroke and tear the darkness with sharp golden claws;<br>To dart a forked, vermilion tongue from open jaws;<br>To puff out bitter smoke which chokes the sun; and fade<br>Back to a still, faint outline obliterate in shade.<br>Creeping up the ladder into the loft, the Boy<br>Stands watching, very still, prickly and hot with joy.<br>He sees the dusty sun-mote slit by streaks of red,<br>He sees it split and stream, and all about his head<br>Spikes and spears of gold are licking, pricking, flicking,<br>Scratching against the walls and furniture, and nicking<br>The darkness into sparks, chipping away the gloom.<br>The Boy's nose smarts with the pungence in the room.<br>The wind pushes an elm branch from before the door<br>And the sun widens out all along the floor,<br>Filling the barn-chamber with white, straightforward light,<br>So not one blurred outline can tease the mind to fright.<br>'O All ye Works of the Lord, Bless<br>ye the Lord; Praise Him, and Magnify Him<br>for ever.<br>O let the Earth Bless the Lord; Yea, let it Praise Him,<br>and Magnify Him<br>for ever.<br>O ye Mountains and Hills, Bless ye the Lord; Praise<br>Him, and Magnify Him<br>for ever.<br>O All ye Green Things upon the Earth, Bless ye the Lord;<br>Praise Him,<br>and Magnify Him for ever.'<br>The Boy will praise his God on an altar builded<br>fair,<br>Will heap it with the Works of the Lord. In the morning<br>air,<br>Spices shall burn on it, and by their pale smoke curled,<br>Like shoots of all the Green Things, the God of this bright World<br>Shall see the Boy's desire to pay his debt of praise.<br>The Boy turns round about, seeking with careful gaze<br>An altar meet and worthy, but each table and chair<br>Has some defect, each piece is needing some repair<br>To perfect it; the chairs have broken legs and backs,<br>The tables are uneven, and every highboy lacks<br>A handle or a drawer, the desks are bruised and worn,<br>And even a wide sofa has its cane seat torn.<br>Only in the gloom far in the corner there<br>The lacquer music-stand is elegant and rare,<br>Clear and slim of line, with its four wings outspread,<br>The sound of old quartets, a tenuous, faint thread,<br>Hanging and floating over it, it stands supreme --<br>Black, and gold, and crimson, in one twisted scheme!<br>A candle on the bookcase feels a draught and wavers,<br>Stippling the white-washed walls with dancing shades and quavers.<br>A bed-post, grown colossal, jigs about the ceiling,<br>And shadows, strangely altered, stain the walls, revealing<br>Eagles, and rabbits, and weird faces pulled awry,<br>And hands which fetch and carry things incessantly.<br>Under the Eastern window, where the morning sun<br>Must touch it, stands the music-stand, and on each one<br>Of its broad platforms is a pyramid of stones,<br>And metals, and dried flowers, and pine and hemlock cones,<br>An oriole's nest with the four eggs neatly blown,<br>The rattle of a rattlesnake, and three large brown<br>Butternuts uncracked, six butterflies impaled<br>With a green luna moth, a snake-skin freshly scaled,<br>Some sunflower seeds, wampum, and a bloody-tooth shell,<br>A blue jay feather, all together piled pell-mell<br>The stand will hold no more. The Boy with humming head<br>Looks once again, blows out the light, and creeps to bed.<br>The Boy keeps solemn vigil, while outside the wind<br>Blows gustily and clear, and slaps against the blind.<br>He hardly tries to sleep, so sharp his ecstasy<br>It burns his soul to emptiness, and sets it free<br>For adoration only, for worship. Dedicate,<br>His unsheathed soul is naked in its novitiate.<br>The hours strike below from the clock on the stair.<br>The Boy is a white flame suspiring in prayer.<br>Morning will bring the sun, the Golden Eye of Him<br>Whose splendour must be veiled by starry cherubim,<br>Whose Feet shimmer like crystal in the streets of Heaven.<br>Like an open rose the sun will stand up even,<br>Fronting the window-sill, and when the casement glows<br>Rose-red with the new-blown morning, then the fire which flows<br>From the sun will fall upon the altar and ignite<br>The spices, and his sacrifice will burn in perfumed light.<br>Over the music-stand the ghosts of sounds will swim,<br>'Viols d'amore' and 'hautbois' accorded to a hymn.<br>The Boy will see the faintest breath of angels' wings<br>Fanning the smoke, and voices will flower through the strings.<br>He dares no farther vision, and with scalding eyes<br>Waits upon the daylight and his great emprise.<br>The cold, grey light of dawn was whitening the<br>wall<br>When the Boy, fine-drawn by sleeplessness, started his ritual.<br>He washed, all shivering and pointed like a flame.<br>He threw the shutters open, and in the window-frame<br>The morning glimmered like a tarnished Venice glass.<br>He took his Chinese pastilles and put them in a mass<br>Upon the mantelpiece till he could seek a plate<br>Worthy to hold them burning. Alas! He had<br>been late<br>In thinking of this need, and now he could not find<br>Platter or saucer rare enough to ease his mind.<br>The house was not astir, and he dared not go down<br>Into the barn-chamber, lest some door should be blown<br>And slam before the draught he made as he went out.<br>The light was growing yellower, and still he looked about.<br>A flash of almost crimson from the gilded pear<br>Upon the music-stand, startled him waiting there.<br>The sun would rise and he would meet it unprepared,<br>Labelled a fool in having missed what he had dared.<br>He ran across the room, took his pastilles and laid<br>Them on the flat-topped pear, most carefully displayed<br>To light with ease, then stood a little to one side,<br>Focussed a burning-glass and painstakingly tried<br>To hold it angled so the bunched and prismed rays<br>Should leap upon each other and spring into a blaze.<br>Sharp as a wheeling edge of disked, carnation flame,<br>Gem-hard and cutting upward, slowly the round sun came.<br>The arrowed fire caught the burning-glass and glanced,<br>Split to a multitude of pointed spears, and lanced,<br>A deeper, hotter flame, it took the incense pile<br>Which welcomed it and broke into a little smile<br>Of yellow flamelets, creeping, crackling, thrusting up,<br>A golden, red-slashed lily in a lacquer cup.<br>'O ye Fire and Heat, Bless ye the Lord;<br>Praise Him, and Magnify Him<br>for ever.<br>O ye Winter and Summer, Bless ye the Lord; Praise Him,<br>and Magnify Him<br>for ever.<br>O ye Nights and Days, Bless ye the Lord; Praise Him,<br>and Magnify Him<br>for ever.<br>O ye Lightnings and Clouds, Bless ye the Lord; Praise<br>Him, and Magnify Him<br>for ever.'<br>A moment so it hung, wide-curved, bright-petalled,<br>seeming<br>A chalice foamed with sunrise. The Boy woke from his<br>dreaming.<br>A spike of flame had caught the card of butterflies,<br>The oriole's nest took fire, soon all four galleries<br>Where he had spread his treasures were become one tongue<br>Of gleaming, brutal fire. The Boy instantly swung<br>His pitcher off the wash-stand and turned it upside down.<br>The flames drooped back and sizzled, and all his senses grown<br>Acute by fear, the Boy grabbed the quilt from his bed<br>And flung it over all, and then with aching head<br>He watched the early sunshine glint on the remains<br>Of his holy offering. The lacquer stand had stains<br>Ugly and charred all over, and where the golden pear<br>Had been, a deep, black hole gaped miserably. His dear<br>Treasures were puffs of ashes; only the stones were there,<br>Winking in the brightness.<br><br>The clock upon the stair<br>Struck five, and in the kitchen someone shook a grate.<br>The Boy began to dress, for it was getting late."
