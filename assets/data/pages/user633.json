Why do men then now not reck his rod?<br><br> Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;<br><br> And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;<br><br> And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil<br><br> Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod. <br><br> And for all this, nature is never spent;<br><br> There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;<br><br> And though the last lights off the black West went<br><br> Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs-; <br><br> Because the Holy Ghost over the bent<br><br> World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.",
