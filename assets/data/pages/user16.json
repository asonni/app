won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.<br><br>2<br>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>Rise up-for you the flag is flung-for you the bugle trills;<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths-for you the shores a-crowding;<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>Here Captain! dear father!<br>This arm beneath your head;<br>It is some dream that on the deck,<br>You've fallen cold and dead.<br><br>3<br>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;<br>The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done; <br>From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;<br>Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!<br>But I, with mournful tread,<br>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><br>Oh! snatched away in beauty's bloom,<br>On thee shall press no ponderous tomb;<br>But on thy turf shall roses rear<br>Their leaves, the earliest of the year;<br>And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom:<br><br>And oft by yon blue gushing stream<br>Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head,<br>And feed deep thought with many a dream,<br>And lingering pause and lightly tread;<br>Fond wretch! as if her step disturbed the dead!<br><br>Away! ye know that tears are vain,<br>That death nor heeds nor hears distress:<br>Will this unteach us to complain?<br>Or make one mourner weep the less?<br>And thou -who tell'st me to forget,<br>Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet.</p><br>Because I could not stop for Death—<br>He kindly stopped for me—<br>The Carriage held but just Ourselves—<br>And Immortality.<br><br>We slowly drove—He knew no haste<br>And I had put away<br>My labor and my leisure too,<br>For His Civility—<br><br>We passed the School, where Children strove<br>At Recess—in the Ring—<br>We passed the fields of Gazing Grain—<br>We passed the Setting Sun—<br><br>Or rather—He passed Us—<br>The Dews drew quivering and chill—<br>For only Gossamer, my Gown—<br>My Tippet—only Tulle—<br><br>We paused before a House that seemed<br>A Swelling of the Ground—<br>The Roof was scarcely visible—<br>The Cornice—in the Ground—<br><br>Since then—'tis Centuries—and yet<br>Feels shorter than the Day<br>I first surmised the Horses' Heads<br>Were toward Eternity—</p><br>Stasis in darkness.<br>Then the substanceless blue<br>Pour of tor and distances.<br><br>God's lioness,<br>How one we grow,<br>Pivot of heels and knees! - The furrow<br><br>Splits and passes, sister to<br>The brown arc<br>Of the neck I cannot catch,<br><br>Nigger-eye<br>Berries cast dark<br>Hooks -<br><br>Black sweet blood mouthfuls,<br>Shadows.<br>Something else<br><br>Hauls me through air -<br>Thighs, hair;<br>Flakes from my heels.<br><br>White<br>Godiva, I unpeel -<br>Dead hands, dead stringencies.<br><br>And now I<br>Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.<br>The child's cry<br><br>Melts in the wall.<br>And I<br>Am the arrow,<br><br>The dew that flies<br>Suicidal, at one with the drive<br>Into the red<br><br>Eye, the cauldron of morning.</p><br>I have no wit, no words, no tears;<br>My heart within me like a stone<br>Is numbed too much for hopes or fears.<br>Look right, look left, I dwell alone;<br>I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief<br>No everlasting hills I see;<br>My life is in the falling leaf:<br>O Jesus, quicken me.<br><br>My life is like a faded leaf,<br>My harvest dwindled to a husk:<br>Truly my life is void and brief<br>And tedious in the barren dusk;<br>My life is like a frozen thing,<br>No bud nor greenness can I see:<br>Yet rise it shall--the sap of spring;<br>O Jesus, rise in me.<br><br>My life is like a broken bowl,<br>A broken bowl that cannot hold<br>One drop of water for my soul<br>Or cordial in the searching cold;<br>Cast in the fire the perished thing;<br>Melt and remould it, till it be<br>A royal cup for Him, my King:<br>O Jesus, drink of me</p><br>Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br>Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br>Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br>Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.<br><br>Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br>Scribbling on the sky the message He is Dead.<br>Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,<br>Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.<br><br>He was my North, my South, my East and West,<br>My working week and my Sunday rest,<br>My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;<br>I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.<br><br>The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,<br>Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,<br>Pour away the ocean and sweep up the woods;<br>For nothing now can ever come to any good.</p><br>I walk down the garden paths,<br>And all the daffodils<br>Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.<br>I walk down the patterned garden-paths<br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br>With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,<br>I too am a rare<br>Pattern. As I wander down<br>The garden paths.<br><br>My dress is richly figured,<br>And the train<br>Makes a pink and silver stain<br>On the gravel, and the thrift<br>Of the borders.<br>Just a plate of current fashion,<br>Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.<br>Not a softness anywhere about me,<br>Only whalebone and brocade.<br>And I sink on a seat in the shade<br>Of a lime tree. For my passion<br>Wars against the stiff brocade.<br>The daffodils and squills<br>Flutter in the breeze<br>As they please.<br>And I weep;<br>For the lime-tree is in blossom<br>And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.<br><br>And the plashing of waterdrops<br>In the marble fountain<br>Comes down the garden-paths.<br>The dripping never stops.<br>Underneath my stiffened gown<br>Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,<br>A basin in the midst of hedges grown<br>So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,<br>But she guesses he is near,<br>And the sliding of the water<br>Seems the stroking of a dear<br>Hand upon her.<br>What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!<br>I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.<br>All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.<br><br>I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,<br>And he would stumble after,<br>Bewildered by my laughter.<br>I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his shoes.<br>I would choose<br>To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,<br>A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,<br>Till he caught me in the shade,<br>And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,<br>Aching, melting, unafraid.<br>With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,<br>And the plopping of the waterdrops,<br>All about us in the open afternoon --<br>I am very like to swoon<br>With the weight of this brocade,For the sun sifts through the shade.<br><br>Underneath the fallen blossom<br>In my bosom,<br>Is a letter I have hid.<br>It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.<br>‘Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell<br>Died in action Thursday se'nnight.’<br>As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,<br>The letters squirmed like snakes.<br>‘Any answer, Madam,’ said my footman.<br>‘No,’ I told him.<br>‘See that the messenger takes some refreshment.<br>No, no answer.’<br>And I walked into the garden,<br>Up and down the patterned paths,<br>In my stiff, correct brocade.<br>The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,<br>Each one.<br>I stood upright too,<br>Held rigid to the pattern<br>By the stiffness of my gown.<br>Up and down I walked,<br>Up and down.<br><br>In a month he would have been my husband.<br>In a month, here, underneath this lime,<br>We would have broke the pattern;<br>He for me, and I for him,<br>He as Colonel, I as Lady,<br>On this shady seat.<br>He had a whim<br>That sunlight carried blessing.<br>And I answered, ‘It shall be as you have said.’<br>Now he is dead.<br><br>In Summer and in Winter I shall walk<br>Up and down<br>The patterned garden-paths<br>In my stiff, brocaded gown.<br>The squills and daffodils<br>Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.<br>I shall go<br>Up and down,<br>In my gown.<br>Gorgeously arrayed,<br>Boned and stayed.<br>And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace<br>By each button, hook, and lace.<br>For the man who should loose me is dead,<br>Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,<br>In a pattern called a war.<br>Christ! What are patterns for?</p><br>And death shall have no dominion.<br>Dead mean naked they shall be one<br>With the man in the wind and the west moon;<br>When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,<br>They shall have stars at elbow and foot;<br>Though they go mad they shall be sane,<br>Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;<br>Though lovers be lost love shall not;<br>And death shall have no dominion.<br><br>And death shall have no dominion.<br>Under the windings of the sea<br>They lying long shall not die windily;<br>Twisting on racks when sinews give way,<br>Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;<br>Faith in their hands shall snap in two,<br>And the unicorn evils run them through;<br>Split all ends up they shan't crack;<br>And death shall have no dominion.<br><br>And death shall have no dominion.<br>No more may gulls cry at their ears<br>Or waves break loud on the seashores;<br>Where blew a flower may a flower no more<br>Lift its head to the blows of the rain;<br>Through they be mad and dead as nails,<br>Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;<br>Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,<br>And death shall have no dominion.</p><br>I died for Beauty—but was scarce<br>Adjusted in the Tomb<br>When One who died for Truth, was lain<br>In an adjoining room—<br><br>He questioned softly 'Why I failed?'<br>'For Beauty,' I replied—<br>'And I—for Truth—Themself are One—<br>We Brethren, are,' He said—<br><br>And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night—<br>We talked between the rooms—<br>Until the moss had reached our lips—<br>And covered up—our names—</p><br>I have done it again.<br>One year in every ten<br>I manage it—<br><br>A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>My right foot<br><br>A paperweight,<br>My face a featureless, fine<br>Jew linen.<br><br>Peel off the napkin<br>O my enemy.<br>Do I terrify?—<br><br>The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>The sour breath<br>Will vanish in a day.<br><br>Soon, soon the flesh<br>The grave cave ate will be<br>At home on me<br><br>And I a smiling woman.<br>I am only thirty.<br>And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>This is Number Three.<br>What a trash<br>To annihilate each decade.<br><br>What a million filaments.<br>The peanut-crunching crowd<br>Shoves in to see<br><br>Them unwrap me hand and foot—<br>The big strip tease.<br>Gentlemen, ladies,<br><br>These are my hands,<br>My knees.I may be skin and bone,<br><br>Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br>The first time it happened I was ten.<br>It was an accident.<br><br>The second time I meant<br>To last it out and not come back at all.<br>I rocked shut<br><br>As a seashell.<br>They had to call and call<br>And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>Dying<br>Is an art, like everything else.<br>I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>I do it so it feels like hell.<br>I do it so it feels real.<br>I guess you could say I've a call.<br><br>It's easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>It's easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>It's the theatrical<br><br>Comeback in broad day<br>To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>Amused shout:<br><br>'A miracle!'<br>That knocks me out.<br>There is a charge<br><br>For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>For the hearing of my heart—<br>It really goes.<br><br>And there is a charge, very large charge,<br>For a word or a touch<br>Or a bit of blood<br><br>Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br>So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>So, Herr Enemy.<br><br>I am your opus,<br>I am your valuable,<br>The pure gold baby<br><br>That melts to a shriek.<br>I turn and burn.<br>Do not think I underestimate your great concern.<br><br>Ash, ash—<br>You poke and stir.<br>Flesh, bone, there is nothing there—<br><br>A cake of soap,<br>A wedding ring,<br>A gold filling.<br><br>Herr God, Herr Lucifer,<br>Beware<br>Beware.<br><br>Out of the ash<br>I rise with my red hair<br>And I eat men like air.</p>"}
