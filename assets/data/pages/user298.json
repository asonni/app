				"main_text": "Through throats where many rivers meet, the curlews cry<br>Under the conceiving moon, on the high chalk hill,<br>And there this night I walk in the white giant's thigh<br>Where barren as boulders women lie longing still<br><br>To labour and love though they lay down long ago.<br><br>Through throats where many rivers meet, the women pray,<br>Pleading in the waded bay for the seed to flow<br>Though the names on their weed grown stones are rained away<br><br>And alone in the night's eternal, curving act<br>They yearn with tongues of curlews for the unconceived<br>And immemorial sons of the cudgelling, hacked<br><br>Hill. Who once in gooseskin winter loved all ice leaved<br>In the courters' lanes, or twined in the ox roasting sun<br>In the wains tonned so high that the wisps of the hay<br>Clung to the pitching clouds, or gay with any one<br>Young as they in the after milking moonlight lay<br><br>Under the lighted shapes of faith and their moonshade<br>Petticoats galed high, or shy with the rough riding boys,<br>Now clasp me to their grains in the gigantic glade,<br><br>Who once, green countries since, were a hedgerow of joys.<br>Time by, their dust was flesh the swineherd rooted sly,<br>Flared in the reek of the wiving sty with the rush<br>Light of his thighs, spreadeagle to the dunghill sky,<br>Or with their orchard man in the core of the sun's bush<br>Rough as cows' tongues and trashed with brambles their buttermilk<br>Manes, under his quenchless summer barbed gold to the bone,<br><br>Or rippling soft in the spinney moon as the silk<br>And ducked and draked white lake that harps to a hail stone.<br><br>Who once were a bloom of wayside brides in the hawed house<br>And heard the lewd, wooed field flow to the coming frost,<br>The scurrying, furred small friars squeal, in the dowse<br>Of day, in the thistle aisles, till the white owl crossed<br><br>Their breast, the vaulting does roister, the horned bucks climb<br>Quick in the wood at love, where a torch of foxes foams,<br>All birds and beasts of the linked night uproar and chime<br><br>And the mole snout blunt under his pilgrimage of domes,<br>Or, butter fat goosegirls, bounced in a gambo bed,<br>Their breasts full of honey, under their gander king<br>Trounced by his wings in the hissing shippen, long dead<br>And gone that barley dark where their clogs danced in the spring,<br>And their firefly hairpins flew, and the ricks ran round -<br><br>(But nothing bore, no mouthing babe to the veined hives<br>Hugged, and barren and bare on Mother Goose's ground<br>They with the simple Jacks were a boulder of wives) -<br><br>Now curlew cry me down to kiss the mouths of their dust.<br><br>The dust of their kettles and clocks swings to and fro<br>Where the hay rides now or the bracken kitchens rust<br>As the arc of the billhooks that flashed the hedges low<br>And cut the birds' boughs that the minstrel sap ran red.<br>They from houses where the harvest bows, hold me hard,<br>Who heard the tall bell sail down the Sundays of the dead<br>And the rain wring out its tongues on the faded yard,<br>Teach me the love that is evergreen after the fall leaved<br>Grave, after Beloved on the grass gulfed cross is scrubbed<br>Off by the sun and Daughters no longer grieved<br>Save by their long desirers in the fox cubbed<br>Streets or hungering in the crumbled wood: to these<br>Hale dead and deathless do the women of the hill<br>Love for ever meridian through the courters' trees<br><br>And the daughters of darkness flame like Fawkes fires still."
