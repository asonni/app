Let me count the ways.<br> I love thee to the depth and breadth and height<br> My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight<br> For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.<br> I love thee to the level of everday's<br> Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.<br> I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;<br> I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.<br> I love thee with the passion put to use<br> In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.<br> I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br> With my lost saints,- I love thee with the breath,<br> Smiles, tears, of all my life!- and, if God choose,<br> I shall but love thee better after death."
