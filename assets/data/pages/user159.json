						},"shuffle": "true","main_text":"Introduction<br><br> <br> Here is a masterly study of the inner life by a heart thirsting after<br> God, eager to grasp at least the outskirts of His ways, the abyss of His<br> love for sinners, and the height of His unapproachable majesty--and it<br> was written by a busy pastor in Chicago!<br><br> Who could imagine David writing the twenty-third Psalm on South Halsted<br> Street, or a medieval mystic finding inspiration in a small study on the<br> second floor of a frame house on that vast, flat checker-board of<br> endless streets<br><br> Where cross the crowded ways of life<br> Where sound the cries of race and clan,<br> In haunts of wretchedness and need,<br> On shadowed threshold dark with fears,<br> And paths where hide the lures of greed ...<br><br> But even as Dr. Frank Mason North, of New York, says in his immortal<br> poem, so Mr. Tozer says in this book:<br><br> Above the noise of selfish strife<br> We hear Thy voice, O Son of Man.<br><br> My acquaintance with the author is limited to brief visits and loving<br> fellowship in his church. There I discovered a self-made scholar, an<br> omnivorous reader with a remarkable library of theological and<br> devotional books, and one who seemed to burn the midnight oil in pursuit<br> of God. His book is the result of long meditation and much prayer. It is<br> not a collection of sermons. It does not deal with the pulpit and the<br> pew but with the soul athirst for God. The chapters could be summarized<br> in Moses' prayer, ‘Show me thy glory,’ or Paul's exclamation, ‘O the<br> depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!’ It is<br> theology not of the head but of the heart.<br><br> There is deep insight, sobriety of style, and a catholicity of outlook<br> that is refreshing. The author has few quotations but he knows the<br> saints and mystics of the centuries--Augustine, Nicholas of Cusa, Thomas<br> à Kempis, von Hügel, Finney, Wesley and many more. The ten chapters are<br> heart searching and the prayers at the close of each are for closet, not<br> pulpit. _I felt the nearness of God while reading them._<br><br> Here is a book for every pastor, missionary, and devout Christian. It<br> deals with the deep things of God and the riches of His grace. Above<br> all, it has the keynote of sincerity and humility.<br><br> _Samuel M. Zwemer_<br><br> New York City<br><br> <br><br> <br> Preface<br><br> <br> In this hour of all-but-universal darkness one cheering gleam appears:<br> within the fold of conservative Christianity there are to be found<br> increasing numbers of persons whose religious lives are marked by a<br> growing hunger after God Himself. They are eager for spiritual realities<br> and will not be put off with words, nor will they be content with<br> correct ‘interpretations’ of truth. They are athirst for God, and they<br> will not be satisfied till they have drunk deep at the Fountain of<br> Living Water.<br><br> This is the only real harbinger of revival which I have been able to<br> detect anywhere on the religious horizon. It may be the cloud the size<br> of a man's hand for which a few saints here and there have been looking.<br> It can result in a resurrection of life for many souls and a recapture<br> of that radiant wonder which should accompany faith in Christ, that<br> wonder which has all but fled the Church of God in our day.<br><br> But this hunger must be recognized by our religious leaders. Current<br> evangelicalism has (to change the figure) laid the altar and divided the<br> sacrifice into parts, but now seems satisfied to count the stones and<br> rearrange the pieces with never a care that there is not a sign of fire<br> upon the top of lofty Carmel. But God be thanked that there are a few<br> who care. They are those who, while they love the altar and delight in<br> the sacrifice, are yet unable to reconcile themselves to the continued<br> absence of fire. They desire God above all. They are athirst to taste<br> for themselves the ‘piercing sweetness’ of the love of Christ about Whom<br> all the holy prophets did write and the psalmists did sing.<br><br> There is today no lack of Bible teachers to set forth correctly the<br> principles of the doctrines of Christ, but too many of these seem<br> satisfied to teach the fundamentals of the faith year after year,<br> strangely unaware that there is in their ministry no manifest Presence,<br> nor anything unusual in their personal lives. They minister constantly<br> to believers who feel within their breasts a longing which their<br> teaching simply does not satisfy.<br><br> I trust I speak in charity, but the lack in our pulpits is real.<br> Milton's terrible sentence applies to our day as accurately as it did to<br> his: ‘The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed.’ It is a solemn thing,<br> and no small scandal in the Kingdom, to see God's children starving<br> while actually seated at the Father's table. The truth of Wesley's words<br> is established before our eyes: ‘Orthodoxy, or right opinion, is, at<br> best, a very slender part of religion. Though right tempers cannot<br> subsist without right opinions, yet right opinions may subsist without<br> right tempers. There may be a right opinion of God without either love<br> or one right temper toward Him. Satan is a proof of this.’<br><br> Thanks to our splendid Bible societies and to other effective agencies<br> for the dissemination of the Word, there are today many millions of<br> people who hold ‘right opinions,’ probably more than ever before in the<br> history of the Church. Yet I wonder if there was ever a time when true<br> spiritual worship was at a lower ebb. To great sections of the Church<br> the art of worship has been lost entirely, and in its place has come<br> that strange and foreign thing called the ‘program.’ This word has been<br> borrowed from the stage and applied with sad wisdom to the type of<br> public service which now passes for worship among us.<br><br> Sound Bible exposition is an imperative _must_ in the Church of the<br> Living God. Without it no church can be a New Testament church in any<br> strict meaning of that term. But exposition may be carried on in such<br> way as to leave the hearers devoid of any true spiritual nourishment<br> whatever. For it is not mere words that nourish the soul, but God<br> Himself, and unless and until the hearers find God in personal<br> experience they are not the better for having heard the truth. The Bible<br> is not an end in itself, but a means to bring men to an intimate and<br> satisfying knowledge of God, that they may enter into Him, that they may<br> delight in His Presence, may taste and know the inner sweetness of the<br> very God Himself in the core and center of their hearts.<br><br> This book is a modest attempt to aid God's hungry children so to find<br> Him. Nothing here is new except in the sense that it is a discovery<br> which my own heart has made of spiritual realities most delightful and<br> wonderful to me. Others before me have gone much farther into these holy<br> mysteries than I have done, but if my fire is not large it is yet real,<br> and there may be those who can light their candle at its flame.<br><br> A. W. Tozer Chicago, Ill. June 16, 1948<br><br> <br><br> <br> I<br><br> _Following Hard after God_<br><br> My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth<br> me.--Psa. 63:8<br><br> <br> Christian theology teaches the doctrine of prevenient grace, which<br> briefly stated means this, that before a man can seek God, God must<br> first have sought the man.<br><br> Before a sinful man can think a right thought of God, there must have<br> been a work of enlightenment done within him; imperfect it may be, but a<br> true work nonetheless, and the secret cause of all desiring and seeking<br> and praying which may follow.<br><br> We pursue God because, and only because, He has first put an urge within<br> us that spurs us to the pursuit. ‘No man can come to me,’ said our Lord,<br> ‘except the Father which hath sent me draw him,’ and it is by this very<br> prevenient _drawing_ that God takes from us every vestige of credit for<br> the act of coming. The impulse to pursue God originates with God, but<br> the outworking of that impulse is our following hard after Him; and all<br> the time we are pursuing Him we are already in His hand: ‘Thy right hand<br> upholdeth me.’<br><br> In this divine ‘upholding’ and human ‘following’ there is no<br> contradiction. All is of God, for as von Hügel teaches, _God is always<br> previous_. In practice, however, (that is, where God's previous working<br> meets man's present response) man must pursue God. On our part there<br> must be positive reciprocation if this secret drawing of God is to<br> eventuate in identifiable experience of the Divine. In the warm language<br> of personal feeling this is stated in the Forty-second Psalm: ‘As the<br> hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O<br> God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come<br> and appear before God?’ This is deep calling unto deep, and the longing<br> heart will understand it.<br><br> The doctrine of justification by faith--a Biblical truth, and a blessed<br> relief from sterile legalism and unavailing self-effort--has in our time<br> fallen into evil company and been interpreted by many in such manner as<br> actually to bar men from the knowledge of God. The whole transaction of<br> religious conversion has been made mechanical and spiritless. Faith may<br> now be exercised without a jar to the moral life and without<br> embarrassment to the Adamic ego. Christ may be ‘received’ without<br> creating any special love for Him in the soul of the receiver. The man<br> is ‘saved,’ but he is not hungry nor thirsty after God. In fact he is<br> specifically taught to be satisfied and encouraged to be content with<br> little.<br><br> The modern scientist has lost God amid the wonders of His world; we<br> Christians are in real danger of losing God amid the wonders of His<br> Word. We have almost forgotten that God is a Person and, as such, can be<br> cultivated as any person can. It is inherent in personality to be able<br> to know other personalities, but full knowledge of one personality by<br> another cannot be achieved in one encounter. It is only after long and<br> loving mental intercourse that the full possibilities of both can be<br> explored.<br><br> All social intercourse between human beings is a response of personality<br> to personality, grading upward from the most casual brush between man<br> and man to the fullest, most intimate communion of which the human soul<br> is capable. Religion, so far as it is genuine, is in essence the<br> response of created personalities to the Creating Personality, God.<br> ‘This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and<br> Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.’<br><br> God is a Person, and in the deep of His mighty nature He thinks, wills,<br> enjoys, feels, loves, desires and suffers as any other person may. In<br> making Himself known to us He stays by the familiar pattern of<br> personality. He communicates with us through the avenues of our minds,<br> our wills and our emotions. The continuous and unembarrassed<br> interchange of love and thought between God and the soul of the redeemed<br> man is the throbbing heart of New Testament religion.<br><br> This intercourse between God and the soul is known to us in conscious<br> personal awareness. It is personal: that is, it does not come through<br> the body of believers, as such, but is known to the individual, and to<br> the body through the individuals which compose it. And it is conscious:<br> that is, it does not stay below the threshold of consciousness and work<br> there unknown to the soul (as, for instance, infant baptism is thought<br> by some to do), but comes within the field of awareness where the man<br> can ‘know’ it as he knows any other fact of experience.<br><br> You and I are in little (our sins excepted) what God is in large. Being<br> made in His image we have within us the capacity to know Him. In our<br> sins we lack only the power. The moment the Spirit has quickened us to<br> life in regeneration our whole being senses its kinship to God and leaps<br> up in joyous recognition. That is the heavenly birth without which we<br> cannot see the Kingdom of God. It is, however, not an end but an<br> inception, for now begins the glorious pursuit, the heart's happy<br> exploration of the infinite riches of the Godhead. That is where we<br> begin, I say, but where we stop no man has yet discovered, for there is<br> in the awful and mysterious depths of the Triune God neither limit nor<br> end.<br><br> Shoreless Ocean, who can sound Thee?<br> Thine own eternity is round Thee,<br> Majesty divine!<br><br> To have found God and still to pursue Him is the soul's paradox of love,<br> scorned indeed by the too-easily-satisfied religionist, but justified in<br> happy experience by the children of the burning heart. St. Bernard<br> stated this holy paradox in a musical quatrain that will be instantly<br> understood by every worshipping soul:<br><br> We taste Thee, O Thou Living Bread,<br> And long to feast upon Thee still:<br> We drink of Thee, the Fountainhead<br> And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.<br><br> Come near to the holy men and women of the past and you will soon feel<br> the heat of their desire after God. They mourned for Him, they prayed<br> and wrestled and sought for Him day and night, in season and out, and<br> when they had found Him the finding was all the sweeter for the long<br> seeking. Moses used the fact that he knew God as an argument for knowing<br> Him better. ‘Now, therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy<br> sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace<br> in thy sight’; and from there he rose to make the daring request, ‘I<br> beseech thee, show me thy glory.’ God was frankly pleased by this<br> display of ardor, and the next day called Moses into the mount, and<br> there in solemn procession made all His glory pass before him.<br><br> David's life was a torrent of spiritual desire, and his psalms ring with<br> the cry of the seeker and the glad shout of the finder. Paul confessed<br> the mainspring of his life to be his burning desire after Christ. ‘That<br> I may know Him,’ was the goal of his heart, and to this he sacrificed<br> everything. ‘Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the<br> excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have<br> suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I<br> may win Christ.’<br><br> Hymnody is sweet with the longing after God, the God whom, while the<br> singer seeks, he knows he has already found. ‘His track I see and I'll<br> pursue,’ sang our fathers only a short generation ago, but that song is<br> heard no more in the great congregation. How tragic that we in this dark<br> day have had our seeking done for us by our teachers. Everything is made<br> to center upon the initial act of ‘accepting’ Christ (a term,<br> incidentally, which is not found in the Bible) and we are not expected<br> thereafter to crave any further revelation of God to our souls. We have<br> been snared in the coils of a spurious logic which insists that if we<br> have found Him we need no more seek Him. This is set before us as the<br> last word in orthodoxy, and it is taken for granted that no Bible-taught<br> Christian ever believed otherwise. Thus the whole testimony of the<br> worshipping, seeking, singing Church on that subject is crisply set<br> aside. The experiential heart-theology of a grand army of fragrant<br> saints is rejected in favor of a smug interpretation of Scripture which<br> would certainly have sounded strange to an Augustine, a Rutherford or a<br> Brainerd.<br><br> In the midst of this great chill there are some, I rejoice to<br> acknowledge, who will not be content with shallow logic. They will admit<br> the force of the argument, and then turn away with tears to hunt some<br> lonely place and pray, ‘O God, show me thy glory.’ They want to taste,<br> to touch with their hearts, to see with their inner eyes the wonder that<br> is God.<br><br> I want deliberately to encourage this mighty longing after God. The lack<br> of it has brought us to our present low estate. The stiff and wooden<br> quality about our religious lives is a result of our lack of holy<br> desire. Complacency is a deadly foe of all spiritual growth. Acute<br> desire must be present or there will be no manifestation of Christ to<br> His people. He waits to be wanted. Too bad that with many of us He waits<br> so long, so very long, in vain.<br><br> Every age has its own characteristics. Right now we are in an age of<br> religious complexity. The simplicity which is in Christ is rarely found<br> among us. In its stead are programs, methods, organizations and a world<br> of nervous activities which occupy time and attention but can never<br> satisfy the longing of the heart. The shallowness of our inner<br> experience, the hollowness of our worship, and that servile imitation of<br> the world which marks our promotional methods all testify that we, in<br> this day, know God only imperfectly, and the peace of God scarcely at<br> all.<br><br> If we would find God amid all the religious externals we must first<br> determine to find Him, and then proceed in the way of simplicity. Now as<br> always God discovers Himself to ‘babes’ and hides Himself in thick<br> darkness from the wise and the prudent. We must simplify our approach to<br> Him. We must strip down to essentials (and they will be found to be<br> blessedly few). We must put away all effort to impress, and come with<br> the guileless candor of childhood. If we do this, without doubt God will<br> quickly respond.<br><br> When religion has said its last word, there is little that we need other<br> than God Himself. The evil habit of seeking _God-and_ effectively<br> prevents us from finding God in full revelation. In the ‘and’ lies our<br> great woe. If we omit the ‘and’ we shall soon find God, and in Him we<br> shall find that for which we have all our lives been secretly longing.<br><br> We need not fear that in seeking God only we may narrow our lives or<br> restrict the motions of our expanding hearts. The opposite is true. We<br> can well afford to make God our All, to concentrate, to sacrifice the<br> many for the One.<br><br> The author of the quaint old English classic, _The Cloud of Unknowing_,<br> teaches us how to do this. ‘Lift up thine heart unto God with a meek<br> stirring of love; and mean Himself, and none of His goods. And thereto,<br> look thee loath to think on aught but God Himself. So that nought work<br> in thy wit, nor in thy will, but only God Himself. This is the work of<br> the soul that most pleaseth God.’<br><br> Again, he recommends that in prayer we practice a further stripping down<br> of everything, even of our theology. ‘For it sufficeth enough, a naked<br> intent direct unto God without any other cause than Himself.’ Yet<br> underneath all his thinking lay the broad foundation of New Testament<br> truth, for he explains that by ‘Himself’ he means ‘God that made thee,<br> and bought thee, and that graciously called thee to thy degree.’ And he<br> is all for simplicity: If we would have religion ‘lapped and folden in<br> one word, for that thou shouldst have better hold thereupon, take thee<br> but a little word of one syllable: for so it is better than of two, for<br> even the shorter it is the better it accordeth with the work of the<br> Spirit. And such a word is this word GOD or this word LOVE.’<br><br> When the Lord divided Canaan among the tribes of Israel Levi received no<br> share of the land. God said to him simply, ‘I am thy part and thine<br> inheritance,’ and by those words made him richer than all his brethren,<br> richer than all the kings and rajas who have ever lived in the world.<br> And there is a spiritual principle here, a principle still valid for<br> every priest of the Most High God.<br><br> The man who has God for his treasure has all things in One. Many<br> ordinary treasures may be denied him, or if he is allowed to have them,<br> the enjoyment of them will be so tempered that they will never be<br> necessary to his happiness. Or if he must see them go, one after one, he<br> will scarcely feel a sense of loss, for having the Source of all things<br> he has in One all satisfaction, all pleasure, all delight. Whatever he<br> may lose he has actually lost nothing, for he now has it all in One, and<br> he has it purely, legitimately and forever.<br><br> _O God, I have tasted Thy goodness, and it has both satisfied me and<br> made me thirsty for more. I am painfully conscious of my need of further<br> grace. I am ashamed of my lack of desire. O God, the Triune God, I want<br> to want Thee; I long to be filled with longing; I thirst to be made more<br> thirsty still. Show me Thy glory, I pray Thee, that so I may know Thee<br> indeed. Begin in mercy a new work of love within me. Say to my soul,<br> ‘Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.’ Then give me grace to<br> rise and follow Thee up from this misty lowland where I have wandered so<br> long. In Jesus' Name, Amen._<br><br> <br><br> <br> II<br><br> _The Blessedness of Possessing Nothing_<br><br> Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of<br> heaven.--Matt. 5:3<br><br> <br> Before the Lord God made man upon the earth He first prepared for him by<br> creating a world of useful and pleasant things for his sustenance and<br> delight. In the Genesis account of the creation these are called simply<br> ‘things.’ They were made for man's uses, but they were meant always to<br> be external to the man and subservient to him. In the deep heart of the<br> man was a shrine where none but God was worthy to come. Within him was<br> God; without, a thousand gifts which God had showered upon him.<br><br> But sin has introduced complications and has made those very gifts of<br> God a potential source of ruin to the soul.<br><br> Our woes began when God was forced out of His central shrine and<br> ‘things’ were allowed to enter. Within the human heart ‘things’ have<br> taken over. Men have now by nature no peace within their hearts, for God<br> is crowned there no longer, but there in the moral dusk stubborn and<br> aggressive usurpers fight among themselves for first place on the<br> throne.<br><br> This is not a mere metaphor, but an accurate analysis of our real<br> spiritual trouble. There is within the human heart a tough fibrous root<br> of fallen life whose nature is to possess, always to possess. It covets<br> ‘things’ with a deep and fierce passion. The pronouns ‘my’ and ‘mine’<br> look innocent enough in print, but their constant and universal use is<br> significant. They express the real nature of the old Adamic man better<br> than a thousand volumes of theology could do. They are verbal symptoms<br> of our deep disease. The roots of our hearts have grown down into<br> _things_, and we dare not pull up one rootlet lest we die. Things have<br> become necessary to us, a development never originally intended. God's<br> gifts now take the place of God, and the whole course of nature is upset<br> by the monstrous substitution.<br><br> Our Lord referred to this tyranny of _things_ when He said to His<br> disciples, ‘If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and<br> take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall<br> lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.’<br><br> Breaking this truth into fragments for our better understanding, it<br> would seem that there is within each of us an enemy which we tolerate at<br> our peril. Jesus called it ‘life’ and ‘self,’ or as we would say, the<br> _self-life_. Its chief characteristic is its possessiveness: the words<br> ‘gain’ and ‘profit’ suggest this. To allow this enemy to live is in the<br> end to lose everything. To repudiate it and give up all for Christ's<br> sake is to lose nothing at last, but to preserve everything unto life<br> eternal. And possibly also a hint is given here as to the only effective<br> way to destroy this foe: it is by the Cross. ‘Let him take up his cross<br> and follow me.’<br><br> The way to deeper knowledge of God is through the lonely valleys of soul<br> poverty and abnegation of all things. The blessed ones who possess the<br> Kingdom are they who have repudiated every external thing and have<br> rooted from their hearts all sense of possessing. These are the ‘poor in<br> spirit.’ They have reached an inward state paralleling the outward<br> circumstances of the common beggar in the streets of Jerusalem; that is<br> what the word ‘poor’ as Christ used it actually means. These blessed<br> poor are no longer slaves to the tyranny of _things_. They have broken<br> the yoke of the oppressor; and this they have done not by fighting but<br> by surrendering. Though free from all sense of possessing, they yet<br> possess all things. ‘Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.’<br><br> Let me exhort you to take this seriously. It is not to be understood as<br> mere Bible teaching to be stored away in the mind along with an inert<br> mass of other doctrines. It is a marker on the road to greener pastures,<br> a path chiseled against the steep sides of the mount of God. We dare not<br> try to by-pass it if we would follow on in this holy pursuit. We must<br> ascend a step at a time. If we refuse one step we bring our progress to<br> an end.<br><br> As is frequently true, this New Testament principle of spiritual life<br> finds its best illustration in the Old Testament. In the story of<br> Abraham and Isaac we have a dramatic picture of the surrendered life as<br> well as an excellent commentary on the first Beatitude.<br><br> Abraham was old when Isaac was born, old enough indeed to have been his<br> grandfather, and the child became at once the delight and idol of his<br> heart. From that moment when he first stooped to take the tiny form<br> awkwardly in his arms he was an eager love slave of his son. God went<br> out of His way to comment on the strength of this affection. And it is<br> not hard to understand. The baby represented everything sacred to his<br> father's heart: the promises of God, the covenants, the hopes of the<br> years and the long messianic dream. As he watched him grow from babyhood<br> to young manhood the heart of the old man was knit closer and closer<br> with the life of his son, till at last the relationship bordered upon<br> the perilous. It was then that God stepped in to save both father and<br> son from the consequences of an uncleansed love.<br><br> ‘Take now thy son,’ said God to Abraham, ‘thine only son Isaac, whom<br> thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there<br> for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee<br> of.’ The sacred writer spares us a close-up of the agony that night on<br> the slopes near Beersheba when the aged man had it out with his God, but<br> respectful imagination may view in awe the bent form and convulsive<br> wrestling alone under the stars. Possibly not again until a Greater than<br> Abraham wrestled in the Garden of Gethsemane did such mortal pain visit<br> a human soul. If only the man himself might have been allowed to die.<br> That would have been easier a thousand times, for he was old now, and to<br> die would have been no great ordeal for one who had walked so long with<br> God. Besides, it would have been a last sweet pleasure to let his<br> dimming vision rest upon the figure of his stalwart son who would live<br> to carry on the Abrahamic line and fulfill in himself the promises of<br> God made long before in Ur of the Chaldees.<br><br> How should he slay the lad! Even if he could get the consent of his<br> wounded and protesting heart, how could he reconcile the act with the<br> promise, ‘In Isaac shall thy seed be called’? This was Abraham's trial<br> by fire, and he did not fail in the crucible. While the stars still<br> shone like sharp white points above the tent where the sleeping Isaac<br> lay, and long before the gray dawn had begun to lighten the east, the<br> old saint had made up his mind. He would offer his son as God had<br> directed him to do, and _then trust God to raise him from the dead_.<br> This, says the writer to the Hebrews, was the solution his aching heart<br> found sometime in the dark night, and he rose ‘early in the morning’ to<br> carry out the plan. It is beautiful to see that, while he erred as to<br> God's method, he had correctly sensed the secret of His great heart. And<br> the solution accords well with the New Testament Scripture, ‘Whosoever<br> will lose for my sake shall find.’<br><br> God let the suffering old man go through with it up to the point where<br> He knew there would be no retreat, and then forbade him to lay a hand<br> upon the boy. To the wondering patriarch He now says in effect, ‘It's<br> all right, Abraham. I never intended that you should actually slay the<br> lad. I only wanted to remove him from the temple of your heart that I<br> might reign unchallenged there. I wanted to correct the perversion that<br> existed in your love. Now you may have the boy, sound and well. Take him<br> and go back to your tent. Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that<br> thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.’<br><br> Then heaven opened and a voice was heard saying to him, ‘By myself have<br> I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast<br> not withheld thy son, thine only son: that in blessing I will bless<br> thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the<br> heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall<br> possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations<br> of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.’<br><br> The old man of God lifted his head to respond to the Voice, and stood<br> there on the mount strong and pure and grand, a man marked out by the<br> Lord for special treatment, a friend and favorite of the Most High. Now<br> he was a man wholly surrendered, a man utterly obedient, a man who<br> possessed nothing. He had concentrated his all in the person of his dear<br> son, and God had taken it from him. God could have begun out on the<br> margin of Abraham's life and worked inward to the center; He chose<br> rather to cut quickly to the heart and have it over in one sharp act of<br> separation. In dealing thus He practiced an economy of means and time.<br> It hurt cruelly, but it was effective.<br><br> I have said that Abraham possessed nothing. Yet was not this poor man<br> rich? Everything he had owned before was his still to enjoy: sheep,<br> camels, herds, and goods of every sort. He had also his wife and his<br> friends, and best of all he had his son Isaac safe by his side. He had<br> everything, but _he possessed nothing_. There is the spiritual secret.<br> There is the sweet theology of the heart which can be learned only in<br> the school of renunciation. The books on systematic theology overlook<br> this, but the wise will understand.<br><br> After that bitter and blessed experience I think the words ‘my’ and<br> ‘mine’ never had again the same meaning for Abraham. The sense of<br> possession which they connote was gone from his heart. _Things_ had been<br> cast out forever. They had now become external to the man. His inner<br> heart was free from them. The world said, ‘Abraham is rich,’ but the<br> aged patriarch only smiled. He could not explain it to them, but he knew<br> that he owned nothing, that his real treasures were inward and eternal.<br><br> There can be no doubt that this possessive clinging to things is one of<br> the most harmful habits in the life. Because it is so natural it is<br> rarely recognized for the evil that it is; but its outworkings are<br> tragic.<br><br> We are often hindered from giving up our treasures to the Lord out of<br> fear for their safety; this is especially true when those treasures are<br> loved relatives and friends. But we need have no such fears. Our Lord<br> came not to destroy but to save. Everything is safe which we commit to<br> Him, and nothing is really safe which is not so committed.<br><br> Our gifts and talents should also be turned over to Him. They should be<br> recognized for what they are, God's loan to us, and should never be<br> considered in any sense our own. We have no more right to claim credit<br> for special abilities than for blue eyes or strong muscles. ‘For who<br> maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst<br> not receive?’<br><br> The Christian who is alive enough to know himself even slightly will<br> recognize the symptoms of this possession malady, and will grieve to<br> find them in his own heart. If the longing after God is strong enough<br> within him he will want to do something about the matter. Now, what<br> should he do?<br><br> First of all he should put away all defense and make no attempt to<br> excuse himself either in his own eyes or before the Lord. Whoever<br> defends himself will have himself for his defense, and he will have no<br> other; but let him come defenseless before the Lord and he will have for<br> his defender no less than God Himself. Let the inquiring Christian<br> trample under foot every slippery trick of his deceitful heart and<br> insist upon frank and open relations with the Lord.<br><br> Then he should remember that this is holy business. No careless or<br> casual dealings will suffice. Let him come to God in full determination<br> to be heard. Let him insist that God accept his all, that He take<br> _things_ out of his heart and Himself reign there in power. It may be he<br> will need to become specific, to name things and people by their names<br> one by one. If he will become drastic enough he can shorten the time of<br> his travail from years to minutes and enter the good land long before<br> his slower brethren who coddle their feelings and insist upon caution in<br> their dealings with God.<br><br> Let us never forget that such a truth as this cannot be learned by rote<br> as one would learn the facts of physical science. They must be<br> _experienced_ before we can really know them. We must in our hearts live<br> through Abraham's harsh and bitter experiences if we would know the<br> blessedness which follows them. The ancient curse will not go out<br> painlessly; the tough old miser within us will not lie down and die<br> obedient to our command. He must be torn out of our heart like a plant<br> from the soil; he must be extracted in agony and blood like a tooth from<br> the jaw. He must be expelled from our soul by violence as Christ<br> expelled the money changers from the temple. And we shall need to steel<br> ourselves against his piteous begging, and to recognize it as springing<br> out of self-pity, one of the most reprehensible sins of the human heart.<br><br> If we would indeed know God in growing intimacy we must go this way of<br> renunciation. And if we are set upon the pursuit of God He will sooner<br> or later bring us to this test. Abraham's testing was, at the time, not<br> known to him as such, yet if he had taken some course other than the one<br> he did, the whole history of the Old Testament would have been<br> different. God would have found His man, no doubt, but the loss to<br> Abraham would have been tragic beyond the telling. So we will be brought<br> one by one to the testing place, and we may never know when we are<br> there. At that testing place there will be no dozen possible choices<br> for us; just one and an alternative, but our whole future will be<br> conditioned by the choice we make.<br><br> _Father, I want to know Thee, but my coward heart fears to give up its<br> toys. I cannot part with them without inward bleeding, and I do not try<br> to hide from Thee the terror of the parting. I come trembling, but I do<br> come. Please root from my heart all those things which I have cherished<br> so long and which have become a very part of my living self, so that<br> Thou mayest enter and dwell there without a rival. Then shalt Thou make<br> the place of Thy feet glorious. Then shall my heart have no need of the<br> sun to shine in it, for Thyself wilt be the light of it, and there shall<br> be no night there. In Jesus' Name, Amen._<br><br> <br><br> <br> III<br><br> _Removing the Veil_<br><br> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by<br> the blood of Jesus.--Heb. 10:19<br><br> <br> Among the famous sayings of the Church fathers none is better known than<br> Augustine's, ‘Thou hast formed us for Thyself, and our hearts are<br> restless till they find rest in Thee.’<br><br> The great saint states here in few words the origin and interior history<br> of the human race. God made us for Himself: that is the only explanation<br> that satisfies the _heart_ of a thinking man, whatever his wild reason<br> may say. Should faulty education and perverse reasoning lead a man to<br> conclude otherwise, there is little that any Christian can do for him.<br> For such a man I have no message. My appeal is addressed to those who<br> have been previously taught in secret by the wisdom of God; I speak to<br> thirsty hearts whose longings have been wakened by the touch of God<br> within them, and such as they need no reasoned proof. Their restless<br> hearts furnish all the proof they need.<br><br> God formed us for Himself. The _Shorter Catechism_, ‘Agreed upon by the<br> Reverend Assembly of Divines at Westminster,’ as the old _New-England<br> Primer_ has it, asks the ancient questions _what_ and _why_ and answers<br> them in one short sentence hardly matched in any uninspired work.<br> ‘_Question_: What is the chief End of Man? _Answer_: Man's chief End is<br> to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.’ With this agree the four and<br> twenty elders who fall on their faces to worship Him that liveth for<br> ever and ever, saying, ‘Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and<br> honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure<br> they are and were created.’<br><br> God formed us for His pleasure, and so formed us that we as well as He<br> can in divine communion enjoy the sweet and mysterious mingling of<br> kindred personalities. He meant us to see Him and live with Him and draw<br> our life from His smile. But we have been guilty of that ‘foul revolt’<br> of which Milton speaks when describing the rebellion of Satan and his<br> hosts. We have broken with God. We have ceased to obey Him or love Him<br> and in guilt and fear have fled as far as possible from His Presence.<br><br> Yet who can flee from His Presence when the heaven and the heaven of<br> heavens cannot contain Him? when as the wisdom of Solomon testifies,<br> ‘the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world?’ The omnipresence of the Lord<br> is one thing, and is a solemn fact necessary to His perfection; the<br> _manifest_ Presence is another thing altogether, and from that Presence<br> we have fled, like Adam, to hide among the trees of the garden, or like<br> Peter to shrink away crying, ‘Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O<br> Lord.’<br><br> So the life of man upon the earth is a life away from the Presence,<br> wrenched loose from that ‘blissful center’ which is our right and proper<br> dwelling place, our first estate which we kept not, the loss of which is<br> the cause of our unceasing restlessness.<br><br> The whole work of God in redemption is to undo the tragic effects of<br> that foul revolt, and to bring us back again into right and eternal<br> relationship with Himself. This required that our sins be disposed of<br> satisfactorily, that a full reconciliation be effected and the way<br> opened for us to return again into conscious communion with God and to<br> live again in the Presence as before. Then by His prevenient working<br> within us He moves us to return. This first comes to our notice when our<br> restless hearts feel a yearning for the Presence of God and we say<br> within ourselves, ‘I will arise and go to my Father.’ That is the first<br> step, and as the Chinese sage Lao-tze has said, ‘The journey of a<br> thousand miles begins with a first step.’<br><br> The interior journey of the soul from the wilds of sin into the enjoyed<br> Presence of God is beautifully illustrated in the Old Testament<br> tabernacle. The returning sinner first entered the outer court where he<br> offered a blood sacrifice on the brazen altar and washed himself in the<br> laver that stood near it. Then through a veil he passed into the holy<br> place where no natural light could come, but the golden candlestick<br> which spoke of Jesus the Light of the World threw its soft glow over<br> all. There also was the shewbread to tell of Jesus, the Bread of Life,<br> and the altar of incense, a figure of unceasing prayer.<br><br> Though the worshipper had enjoyed so much, still he had not yet entered<br> the Presence of God. Another veil separated from the Holy of Holies<br> where above the mercy seat dwelt the very God Himself in awful and<br> glorious manifestation. While the tabernacle stood, only the high priest<br> could enter there, and that but once a year, with blood which he offered<br> for his sins and the sins of the people. It was this last veil which was<br> rent when our Lord gave up the ghost on Calvary, and the sacred writer<br> explains that this rending of the veil opened the way for every<br> worshipper in the world to come by the new and living way straight into<br> the divine Presence.<br><br> Everything in the New Testament accords with this Old Testament picture.<br> Ransomed men need no longer pause in fear to enter the Holy of Holies.<br> _God wills that we should push on into His Presence and live our whole<br> life there._ This is to be known to us in conscious experience. It is<br> more than a doctrine to be held, it is a life to be enjoyed every moment<br> of every day.<br><br> This Flame of the Presence was the beating heart of the Levitical order.<br> Without it all the appointments of the tabernacle were characters of<br> some unknown language; they had no meaning for Israel or for us. The<br> greatest fact of the tabernacle was that _Jehovah was there_; a Presence<br> was waiting within the veil. Similarly the Presence of God is the<br> central fact of Christianity. At the heart of the Christian message is<br> God Himself waiting for His redeemed children to push in to conscious<br> awareness of His Presence. That type of Christianity which happens now<br> to be the vogue knows this Presence only in theory. It fails to stress<br> the Christian's privilege of present realization. According to its<br> teachings we are in the Presence of God positionally, and nothing is<br> said about the need to experience that Presence actually. The fiery urge<br> that drove men like McCheyne is wholly missing. And the present<br> generation of Christians measures itself by this imperfect rule. Ignoble<br> contentment takes the place of burning zeal. We are satisfied to rest in<br> our _judicial_ possessions and for the most part we bother ourselves<br> very little about the absence of personal experience.<br><br> Who is this within the veil who dwells in fiery manifestations? It is<br> none other than God Himself, ‘One God the Father Almighty, Maker of<br> heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible,’ and ‘One<br> Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God; begotten of His Father<br> before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God;<br> begotten, not made; being of one substance with the Father,’ and ‘the<br> Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, Who proceedeth from the Father<br> and the Son, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and<br> glorified.’ Yet this holy Trinity is One God, for ‘we worship one God in<br> Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor<br> dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another<br> of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the<br> Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one: the glory equal<br> and the majesty co-eternal.’ So in part run the ancient creeds, and so<br> the inspired Word declares.<br><br> Behind the veil is God, that God after Whom the world, with strange<br> inconsistency, has felt, ‘if haply they might find Him.’ He has<br> discovered Himself to some extent in nature, but more perfectly in the<br> Incarnation; now He waits to show Himself in ravishing fulness to the<br> humble of soul and the pure in heart.<br><br> The world is perishing for lack of the knowledge of God and the Church<br> is famishing for want of His Presence. The instant cure of most of our<br> religious ills would be to enter the Presence in spiritual experience,<br> to become suddenly aware that we are in God and that God is in us. This<br> would lift us out of our pitiful narrowness and cause our hearts to be<br> enlarged. This would burn away the impurities from our lives as the bugs<br> and fungi were burned away by the fire that dwelt in the bush.<br><br> What a broad world to roam in, what a sea to swim in is this God and<br> Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is _eternal_, which means that He<br> antedates time and is wholly independent of it. Time began in Him and<br> will end in Him. To it He pays no tribute and from it He suffers no<br> change. He is _immutable_, which means that He has never changed and can<br> never change in any smallest measure. To change He would need to go from<br> better to worse or from worse to better. He cannot do either, for being<br> perfect He cannot become more perfect, and if He were to become less<br> perfect He would be less than God. He is _omniscient_, which means that<br> He knows in one free and effortless act all matter, all spirit, all<br> relationships, all events. He has no past and He has no future. He _is_,<br> and none of the limiting and qualifying terms used of creatures can<br> apply to Him. _Love_ and _mercy_ and _righteousness_ are His, and<br> _holiness_ so ineffable that no comparisons or figures will avail to<br> express it. Only fire can give even a remote conception of it. In fire<br> He appeared at the burning bush; in the pillar of fire He dwelt through<br> all the long wilderness journey. The fire that glowed between the wings<br> of the cherubim in the holy place was called the ‘shekinah,’ the<br> Presence, through the years of Israel's glory, and when the Old had<br> given place to the New, He came at Pentecost as a fiery flame and rested<br> upon each disciple.<br><br> Spinoza wrote of the intellectual love of God, and he had a measure of<br> truth there; but the highest love of God is not intellectual, it is<br> spiritual. God is spirit and only the spirit of man can know Him really.<br> In the deep spirit of a man the fire must glow or his love is not the<br> true love of God. The great of the Kingdom have been those who loved God<br> more than others did. We all know who they have been and gladly pay<br> tribute to the depths and sincerity of their devotion. We have but to<br> pause for a moment and their names come trooping past us smelling of<br> myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces.<br><br> Frederick Faber was one whose soul panted after God as the roe pants<br> after the water brook, and the measure in which God revealed Himself to<br> his seeking heart set the good man's whole life afire with a burning<br> adoration rivaling that of the seraphim before the throne. His love for<br> God extended to the three Persons of the Godhead equally, yet he seemed<br> to feel for each One a special kind of love reserved for Him alone. Of<br> God the Father he sings:<br><br> Only to sit and think of God,<br> Oh what a joy it is!<br> To think the thought, to breathe the Name;<br> Earth has no higher bliss.<br><br> Father of Jesus, love's reward!<br> What rapture will it be,<br> Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,<br> And gaze and gaze on Thee!<br><br> His love for the Person of Christ was so intense that it threatened to<br> consume him; it burned within him as a sweet and holy madness and flowed<br> from his lips like molten gold. In one of his sermons he says, ‘Wherever<br> we turn in the church of God, there is Jesus. He is the beginning,<br> middle and end of everything to us.... There is nothing good, nothing<br> holy, nothing beautiful, nothing joyous which He is not to His servants.<br> No one need be poor, because, if he chooses, he can have Jesus for his<br> own property and possession. No one need be downcast, for Jesus is the<br> joy of heaven, and it is His joy to enter into sorrowful hearts. We can<br> exaggerate about many things; but we can never exaggerate our obligation<br> to Jesus, or the compassionate abundance of the love of Jesus to us. All<br> our lives long we might talk of Jesus, and yet we should never come to<br> an end of the sweet things that might be said of Him. Eternity will not<br> be long enough to learn all He is, or to praise Him for all He has done,<br> but then, that matters not; for we shall be always with Him, and we<br> desire nothing more.’ And addressing our Lord directly he says to Him:<br><br> I love Thee so, I know not how<br> My transports to control;<br> Thy love is like a burning fire<br> Within my very soul.<br><br> Faber's blazing love extended also to the Holy Spirit. Not only in his<br> theology did he acknowledge His deity and full equality with the Father<br> and the Son, but he celebrated it constantly in his songs and in his<br> prayers. He literally pressed his forehead to the ground in his eager<br> fervid worship of the Third Person of the Godhead. In one of his great<br> hymns to the Holy Spirit he sums up his burning devotion thus:<br><br> O Spirit, beautiful and dread!<br> My heart is fit to break<br> With love of all Thy tenderness<br> For us poor sinners' sake.<br><br> I have risked the tedium of quotation that I might show by pointed<br> example what I have set out to say, viz., that God is so vastly<br> wonderful, so utterly and completely delightful that He can, without<br> anything other than Himself, meet and overflow the deepest demands of<br> our total nature, mysterious and deep as that nature is. Such worship as<br> Faber knew (and he is but one of a great company which no man can<br> number) can never come from a mere doctrinal knowledge of God. Hearts<br> that are ‘fit to break’ with love for the Godhead are those who have<br> been in the Presence and have looked with opened eye upon the majesty<br> of Deity. Men of the breaking hearts had a quality about them not known<br> to or understood by common men. They habitually spoke with spiritual<br> authority. They had been in the Presence of God and they reported what<br> they saw there. They were prophets, not scribes, for the scribe tells us<br> what he has read, and the prophet tells what he has seen.<br><br> The distinction is not an imaginary one. Between the scribe who has read<br> and the prophet who has seen there is a difference as wide as the sea.<br> We are today overrun with orthodox scribes, but the prophets, where are<br> they? The hard voice of the scribe sounds over evangelicalism, but the<br> Church waits for the tender voice of the saint who has penetrated the<br> veil and has gazed with inward eye upon the Wonder that is God. And yet,<br> thus to penetrate, to push in sensitive living experience into the holy<br> Presence, is a privilege open to every child of God.<br><br> With the veil removed by the rending of Jesus' flesh, with nothing on<br> God's side to prevent us from entering, why do we tarry without? Why do<br> we consent to abide all our days just outside the Holy of Holies and<br> never enter at all to look upon God? We hear the Bridegroom say, ‘Let me<br> see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice and<br> thy countenance is comely.’ We sense that the call is for us, but still<br> we fail to draw near, and the years pass and we grow old and tired in<br> the outer courts of the tabernacle. What doth hinder us?<br><br> The answer usually given, simply that we are ‘cold,’ will not explain<br> all the facts. There is something more serious than coldness of heart,<br> something that may be back of that coldness and be the cause of its<br> existence. What is it? What but the presence of _a veil in our hearts_?<br> a veil not taken away as the first veil was, but which remains there<br> still shutting out the light and hiding the face of God from us. It is<br> the veil of our fleshly fallen nature living on, unjudged within us,<br> uncrucified and unrepudiated. It is the close-woven veil of the<br> self-life which we have never truly acknowledged, of which we have been<br> secretly ashamed, and which for these reasons we have never brought to<br> the judgment of the cross. It is not too mysterious, this opaque veil,<br> nor is it hard to identify. We have but to look in our own hearts and we<br> shall see it there, sewn and patched and repaired it may be, but there<br> nevertheless, an enemy to our lives and an effective block to our<br> spiritual progress.<br><br> This veil is not a beautiful thing and it is not a thing about which we<br> commonly care to talk, but I am addressing the thirsting souls who are<br> determined to follow God, and I know they will not turn back because the<br> way leads temporarily through the blackened hills. The urge of God<br> within them will assure their continuing the pursuit. They will face the<br> facts however unpleasant and endure the cross for the joy set before<br> them. So I am bold to name the threads out of which this inner veil is<br> woven.<br><br> It is woven of the fine threads of the self-life, the hyphenated sins of<br> the human spirit. They are not something we do, they are something we<br> _are_, and therein lies both their subtlety and their power.<br><br> To be specific, the self-sins are these: self-righteousness, self-pity,<br> self-confidence, self-sufficiency, self-admiration, self-love and a host<br> of others like them. They dwell too deep within us and are too much a<br> part of our natures to come to our attention till the light of God is<br> focused upon them. The grosser manifestations of these sins, egotism,<br> exhibitionism, self-promotion, are strangely tolerated in Christian<br> leaders even in circles of impeccable orthodoxy. They are so much in<br> evidence as actually, for many people, to become identified with the<br> gospel. I trust it is not a cynical observation to say that they appear<br> these days to be a requisite for popularity in some sections of the<br> Church visible. Promoting self under the guise of promoting Christ is<br> currently so common as to excite little notice.<br><br> One should suppose that proper instruction in the doctrines of man's<br> depravity and the necessity for justification through the righteousness<br> of Christ alone would deliver us from the power of the self-sins; but it<br> does not work out that way. Self can live unrebuked at the very altar.<br> It can watch the bleeding Victim die and not be in the least affected by<br> what it sees. It can fight for the faith of the Reformers and preach<br> eloquently the creed of salvation by grace, and gain strength by its<br> efforts. To tell all the truth, it seems actually to feed upon orthodoxy<br> and is more at home in a Bible Conference than in a tavern. Our very<br> state of longing after God may afford it an excellent condition under<br> which to thrive and grow.<br><br> Self is the opaque veil that hides the Face of God from us. It can be<br> removed only in spiritual experience, never by mere instruction. As well<br> try to instruct leprosy out of our system. There must be a work of God<br> in destruction before we are free. We must invite the cross to do its<br> deadly work within us. We must bring our self-sins to the cross for<br> judgment. We must prepare ourselves for an ordeal of suffering in some<br> measure like that through which our Saviour passed when He suffered<br> under Pontius Pilate.<br><br> Let us remember: when we talk of the rending of the veil we are speaking<br> in a figure, and the thought of it is poetical, almost pleasant; but in<br> actuality there is nothing pleasant about it. In human experience that<br> veil is made of living spiritual tissue; it is composed of the sentient,<br> quivering stuff of which our whole beings consist, and to touch it is to<br> touch us where we feel pain. To tear it away is to injure us, to hurt us<br> and make us bleed. To say otherwise is to make the cross no cross and<br> death no death at all. It is never fun to die. To rip through the dear<br> and tender stuff of which life is made can never be anything but deeply<br> painful. Yet that is what the cross did to Jesus and it is what the<br> cross would do to every man to set him free.<br><br> Let us beware of tinkering with our inner life in hope ourselves to rend<br> the veil. God must do everything for us. Our part is to yield and trust.<br> We must confess, forsake, repudiate the self-life, and then reckon it<br> crucified. But we must be careful to distinguish lazy ‘acceptance’ from<br> the real work of God. We must insist upon the work being done. We dare<br> not rest content with a neat doctrine of self-crucifixion. That is to<br> imitate Saul and spare the best of the sheep and the oxen.<br><br> Insist that the work be done in very truth and it will be done. The<br> cross is rough, and it is deadly, but it is effective. It does not keep<br> its victim hanging there forever. There comes a moment when its work is<br> finished and the suffering victim dies. After that is resurrection glory<br> and power, and the pain is forgotten for joy that the veil is taken away<br> and we have entered in actual spiritual experience the Presence of the<br> living God.<br><br> _Lord, how excellent are Thy ways, and how devious and dark are the ways<br> of man. Show us how to die, that we may rise again to newness of life.<br> Rend the veil of our self-life from the top down as Thou didst rend the<br> veil of the Temple. We would draw near in full assurance of faith. We<br> would dwell with Thee in daily experience here on this earth so that we<br> may be accustomed to the glory when we enter Thy heaven to dwell with<br> Thee there. In Jesus' name, Amen._<br><br> <br><br> <br> IV<br><br> _Apprehending God_<br><br> O taste and see.--Psa. 34:8<br><br> <br> It was Canon Holmes, of India, who more than twenty-five years ago<br> called attention to the inferential character of the average man's faith<br> in God. To most people God is an inference, not a reality. He is a<br> deduction from evidence which they consider adequate; but He remains<br> personally unknown to the individual. ‘He _must_ be,’ they say,<br> ‘therefore we believe He is.’ Others do not go even so far as this; they<br> know of Him only by hearsay. They have never bothered to think the<br> matter out for themselves, but have heard about Him from others, and<br> have put belief in Him into the back of their minds along with the<br> various odds and ends that make up their total creed. To many others God<br> is but an ideal, another name for goodness, or beauty, or truth; or He<br> is law, or life, or the creative impulse back of the phenomena of<br> existence.<br><br> These notions about God are many and varied, but they who hold them have<br> one thing in common: they do not know God in personal experience. The<br> possibility of intimate acquaintance with Him has not entered their<br> minds. While admitting His existence they do not think of Him as<br> knowable in the sense that we know things or people.<br><br> Christians, to be sure, go further than this, at least in theory. Their<br> creed requires them to believe in the personality of God, and they have<br> been taught to pray, ‘Our Father, which art in heaven.’ Now personality<br> and fatherhood carry with them the idea of the possibility of personal<br> acquaintance. This is admitted, I say, in theory, but for millions of<br> Christians, nevertheless, God is no more real than He is to the<br> non-Christian. They go through life trying to love an ideal and be loyal<br> to a mere principle.<br><br> Over against all this cloudy vagueness stands the clear scriptural<br> doctrine that God can be known in personal experience. A loving<br> Personality dominates the Bible, walking among the trees of the garden<br> and breathing fragrance over every scene. Always a living Person is<br> present, speaking, pleading, loving, working, and manifesting Himself<br> whenever and wherever His people have the receptivity necessary to<br> receive the manifestation.<br><br> The Bible assumes as a self-evident fact that men can know God with at<br> least the same degree of immediacy as they know any other person or<br> thing that comes within the field of their experience. The same terms<br> are used to express the knowledge of God as are used to express<br> knowledge of physical things. ‘O _taste_ and see that the Lord is good.’<br> ‘All thy garments _smell_ of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the<br> ivory palaces.’ ‘My sheep _hear_ my voice.’ ‘Blessed are the pure in<br> heart, for they shall _see_ God.’ These are but four of countless such<br> passages from the Word of God. And more important than any proof text is<br> the fact that the whole import of the Scripture is toward this belief.<br><br> What can all this mean except that we have in our hearts organs by means<br> of which we can know God as certainly as we know material things through<br> our familiar five senses? We apprehend the physical world by exercising<br> the faculties given us for the purpose, and we possess spiritual<br> faculties by means of which we can know God and the spiritual world if<br> we will obey the Spirit's urge and begin to use them.<br><br> That a saving work must first be done in the heart is taken for granted<br> here. The spiritual faculties of the unregenerate man lie asleep in his<br> nature, unused and for every purpose dead; that is the stroke which has<br> fallen upon us by sin. They may be quickened to active life again by the<br> operation of the Holy Spirit in regeneration; that is one of the<br> immeasurable benefits which come to us through Christ's atoning work on<br> the cross.<br><br> But the very ransomed children of God themselves: why do they know so<br> little of that habitual conscious communion with God which the<br> Scriptures seem to offer? The answer is our chronic unbelief. Faith<br> enables our spiritual sense to function. Where faith is defective the<br> result will be inward insensibility and numbness toward spiritual<br> things. This is the condition of vast numbers of Christians today. No<br> proof is necessary to support that statement. We have but to converse<br> with the first Christian we meet or enter the first church we find open<br> to acquire all the proof we need.<br><br> A spiritual kingdom lies all about us, enclosing us, embracing us,<br> altogether within reach of our inner selves, waiting for us to recognize<br> it. God Himself is here waiting our response to His Presence. This<br> eternal world will come alive to us the moment we begin to reckon upon<br> its reality.<br><br> I have just now used two words which demand definition; or if definition<br> is impossible, I must at least make clear what I mean when I use them.<br> They are ‘reckon’ and ‘reality.’<br><br> What do I mean by _reality_? I mean that which has existence apart from<br> any idea any mind may have of it, and which would exist if there were no<br> mind anywhere to entertain a thought of it. That which is real has being<br> in itself. It does not depend upon the observer for its validity.<br><br> I am aware that there are those who love to poke fun at the plain man's<br> idea of reality. They are the idealists who spin endless proofs that<br> nothing is real outside of the mind. They are the relativists who like<br> to show that there are no fixed points in the universe from which we can<br> measure anything. They smile down upon us from their lofty intellectual<br> peaks and settle us to their own satisfaction by fastening upon us the<br> reproachful term ‘absolutist.’ The Christian is not put out of<br> countenance by this show of contempt. He can smile right back at them,<br> for he knows that there is only One who is Absolute, that is God. But he<br> knows also that the Absolute One has made this world for man's uses,<br> and, while there is nothing fixed or real in the last meaning of the<br> words (the meaning as applied to God) _for every purpose of human life<br> we are permitted to act as if there were_. And every man does act thus<br> except the mentally sick. These unfortunates also have trouble with<br> reality, but they are consistent; they insist upon living in accordance<br> with their ideas of things. They are honest, and it is their very<br> honesty that constitutes them a social problem.<br><br> The idealists and relativists are not mentally sick. They prove their<br> soundness by living their lives according to the very notions of reality<br> which they in theory repudiate and by counting upon the very fixed<br> points which they prove are not there. They could earn a lot more<br> respect for their notions if they were willing to live by them; but<br> this they are careful not to do. Their ideas are brain-deep, not<br> life-deep. Wherever life touches them they repudiate their theories and<br> live like other men.<br><br> The Christian is too sincere to play with ideas for their own sake. He<br> takes no pleasure in the mere spinning of gossamer webs for display. All<br> his beliefs are practical. They are geared into his life. By them he<br> lives or dies, stands or falls for this world and for all time to come.<br> From the insincere man he turns away.<br><br> The sincere plain man knows that the world is real. He finds it here<br> when he wakes to consciousness, and he knows that he did not think it<br> into being. It was here waiting for him when he came, and he knows that<br> when he prepares to leave this earthly scene it will be here still to<br> bid him good-bye as he departs. By the deep wisdom of life he is wiser<br> than a thousand men who doubt. He stands upon the earth and feels the<br> wind and rain in his face and he knows that they are real. He sees the<br> sun by day and the stars by night. He sees the hot lightning play out of<br> the dark thundercloud. He hears the sounds of nature and the cries of<br> human joy and pain. These he knows are real. He lies down on the cool<br> earth at night and has no fear that it will prove illusory or fail him<br> while he sleeps. In the morning the firm ground will be under him, the<br> blue sky above him and the rocks and trees around him as when he closed<br> his eyes the night before. So he lives and rejoices in a world of<br> reality.<br><br> With his five senses he engages this real world. All things necessary to<br> his physical existence he apprehends by the faculties with which he has<br> been equipped by the God who created him and placed him in such a world<br> as this.<br><br> Now, by our definition also God is real. He is real in the absolute and<br> final sense that nothing else is. All other reality is contingent upon<br> His. The great Reality is God who is the Author of that lower and<br> dependent reality which makes up the sum of created things, including<br> ourselves. God has objective existence independent of and apart from any<br> notions which we may have concerning Him. The worshipping heart does not<br> create its Object. It finds Him here when it wakes from its moral<br> slumber in the morning of its regeneration.<br><br> Another word that must be cleared up is the word _reckon_. This does not<br> mean to visualize or imagine. Imagination is not faith. The two are not<br> only different from, but stand in sharp opposition to, each other.<br> Imagination projects unreal images out of the mind and seeks to attach<br> reality to them. Faith creates nothing; it simply reckons upon that<br> which is already _there_.<br><br> God and the spiritual world are real. We can reckon upon them with as<br> much assurance as we reckon upon the familiar world around us.<br> Spiritual things are there (or rather we should say _here_) inviting<br> our attention and challenging our trust.<br><br> Our trouble is that we have established bad thought habits. We<br> habitually think of the visible world as real and doubt the reality of<br> any other. We do not deny the existence of the spiritual world but we<br> doubt that it is real in the accepted meaning of the word.<br><br> The world of sense intrudes upon our attention day and night for the<br> whole of our lifetime. It is clamorous, insistent and<br> self-demonstrating. It does not appeal to our faith; it is here,<br> assaulting our five senses, demanding to be accepted as real and final.<br> But sin has so clouded the lenses of our hearts that we cannot see that<br> other reality, the City of God, shining around us. The world of sense<br> triumphs. The visible becomes the enemy of the invisible; the temporal,<br> of the eternal. That is the curse inherited by every member of Adam's<br> tragic race.<br><br> At the root of the Christian life lies belief in the invisible. The<br> object of the Christian's faith is unseen reality.<br><br> Our uncorrected thinking, influenced by the blindness of our natural<br> hearts and the intrusive ubiquity of visible things, tends to draw a<br> contrast between the spiritual and the real; but actually no such<br> contrast exists. The antithesis lies elsewhere: between the real and the<br> imaginary, between the spiritual and the material, between the temporal<br> and the eternal; but between the spiritual and the real, never. The<br> spiritual _is_ real.<br><br> If we would rise into that region of light and power plainly beckoning<br> us through the Scriptures of truth we must break the evil habit of<br> ignoring the spiritual. We must shift our interest from the seen to the<br> unseen. For the great unseen Reality is God. ‘He that cometh to God must<br> believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently<br> seek him.’ This is basic in the life of faith. From there we can rise to<br> unlimited heights. ‘Ye believe in God,’ said our Lord Jesus Christ,<br> ‘believe also in me.’ Without the first there can be no second.<br><br> If we truly want to follow God we must seek to be other-worldly. This I<br> say knowing well that that word has been used with scorn by the sons of<br> this world and applied to the Christian as a badge of reproach. So be<br> it. Every man must choose his world. If we who follow Christ, with all<br> the facts before us and knowing what we are about, deliberately choose<br> the Kingdom of God as our sphere of interest I see no reason why anyone<br> should object. If we lose by it, the loss is our own; if we gain, we rob<br> no one by so doing. The ‘other world,’ which is the object of this<br> world's disdain and the subject of the drunkard's mocking song, is our<br> carefully chosen goal and the object of our holiest longing.<br><br> But we must avoid the common fault of pushing the ‘other world’ into the<br> future. It is not future, but present. It parallels our familiar<br> physical world, and the doors between the two worlds are open. ‘Ye are<br> come,’ says the writer to the Hebrews (and the tense is plainly<br> present), ‘unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the<br> heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the<br> general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in<br> heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made<br> perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood<br> of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.’ All these<br> things are contrasted with ‘the mount that might be touched’ and ‘the<br> sound of a trumpet and the voice of words’ that might be heard. May we<br> not safely conclude that, as the realities of Mount Sinai were<br> apprehended by the senses, so the realities of Mount Zion are to be<br> grasped by the soul? And this not by any trick of the imagination, but<br> in downright actuality. The soul has eyes with which to see and ears<br> with which to hear. Feeble they may be from long disuse, but by the<br> life-giving touch of Christ alive now and capable of sharpest sight and<br> most sensitive hearing.<br><br> As we begin to focus upon God the things of the spirit will take shape<br> before our inner eyes. Obedience to the word of Christ will bring an<br> inward revelation of the Godhead (John 14:21-23). It will give acute<br> perception enabling us to see God even as is promised to the pure in<br> heart. A new God consciousness will seize upon us and we shall begin to<br> taste and hear and inwardly feel the God who is our life and our all.<br> There will be seen the constant shining of the light that lighteth every<br> man that cometh into the world. More and more, as our faculties grow<br> sharper and more sure, God will become to us the great All, and His<br> Presence the glory and wonder of our lives.<br><br> _O God, quicken to life every power within me, that I may lay hold on<br> eternal things. Open my eyes that I may see; give me acute spiritual<br> perception; enable me to taste Thee and know that Thou art good. Make<br> heaven more real to me than any earthly thing has ever been. Amen._<br><br> <br><br> <br> V<br><br> _The Universal Presence_<br><br> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from<br> thy presence?--Psa. 139:7<br><br> <br> In all Christian teaching certain basic truths are found, hidden at<br> times, and rather assumed than asserted, but necessary to all truth as<br> the primary colors are found in and necessary to the finished painting.<br> Such a truth is the divine immanence.<br><br> God dwells in His creation and is everywhere indivisibly present in all<br> His works. This is boldly taught by prophet and apostle and is accepted<br> by Christian theology generally. That is, it appears in the books, but<br> for some reason it has not sunk into the average Christian's heart so as<br> to become a part of his believing self. Christian teachers shy away from<br> its full implications, and, if they mention it at all, mute it down till<br> it has little meaning. I would guess the reason for this to be the fear<br> of being charged with pantheism; but the doctrine of the divine Presence<br> is definitely not pantheism.<br><br> Pantheism's error is too palpable to deceive anyone. It is that God is<br> the sum of all created things. Nature and God are one, so that whoever<br> touches a leaf or a stone touches God. That is of course to degrade the<br> glory of the incorruptible Deity and, in an effort to make all things<br> divine, banish all divinity from the world entirely.<br><br> The truth is that while God dwells in His world He is separated from it<br> by a gulf forever impassable. However closely He may be identified with<br> the work of His hands _they_ are and must eternally be _other than He_,<br> and He is and must be antecedent to and independent of them. He is<br> transcendent above all His works even while He is immanent within them.<br><br> What now does the divine immanence mean in direct Christian experience?<br> It means simply that _God is here_. Wherever we are, God is here. There<br> is no place, there can be no place, where He is not. Ten million<br> intelligences standing at as many points in space and separated by<br> incomprehensible distances can each one say with equal truth, God is<br> here. No point is nearer to God than any other point. It is exactly as<br> near to God from any place as it is from any other place. No one is in<br> mere distance any further from or any nearer to God than any other<br> person is.<br><br> These are truths believed by every instructed Christian. It remains for<br> us to think on them and pray over them until they begin to glow within<br> us.<br><br> ‘In the beginning God.’ Not _matter_, for matter is not self-causing. It<br> requires an antecedent cause, and God is that Cause. Not _law_, for law<br> is but a name for the course which all creation follows. That course had<br> to be planned, and the Planner is God. Not _mind_, for mind also is a<br> created thing and must have a Creator back of it. In the beginning God,<br> the uncaused Cause of matter, mind and law. There we must begin.<br><br> Adam sinned and, in his panic, frantically tried to do the impossible:<br> he tried to hide from the Presence of God. David also must have had wild<br> thoughts of trying to escape from the Presence, for he wrote, ‘Whither<br> shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?’<br> Then he proceeded through one of his most beautiful psalms to celebrate<br> the glory of the divine immanence. ‘If I ascend up into heaven, thou art<br> there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the<br> wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even<br> there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.’ And he<br> knew that God's _being_ and God's _seeing_ are the same, that the seeing<br> Presence had been with him even before he was born, watching the mystery<br> of unfolding life. Solomon exclaimed, ‘But will God indeed dwell on the<br> earth? behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee:<br> how much less this house which I have builded.’ Paul assured the<br> Athenians that ‘God is not far from any one of us: for in him we live,<br> and move, and have our being.’<br><br> If God is present at every point in space, if we cannot go where He is<br> not, cannot even conceive of a place where He is not, why then has not<br> that Presence become the one universally celebrated fact of the world?<br> The patriarch Jacob, ‘in the waste howling wilderness,’ gave the answer<br> to that question. He saw a vision of God and cried out in wonder,<br> ‘Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.’ Jacob had never<br> been for one small division of a moment outside the circle of that<br> all-pervading Presence. But he knew it not. That was his trouble, and it<br> is ours. Men do not know that God is here. What a difference it would<br> make if they knew.<br><br> The Presence and the manifestation of the Presence are not the same.<br> There can be the one without the other. God is here when we are wholly<br> unaware of it. He is _manifest_ only when and as we are aware of His<br> Presence. On our part there must be surrender to the Spirit of God, for<br> His work it is to show us the Father and the Son. If we co-operate with<br> Him in loving obedience God will manifest Himself to us, and that<br> manifestation will be the difference between a nominal Christian life<br> and a life radiant with the light of His face.<br><br> Always, everywhere God is present, and always He seeks to discover<br> Himself. To each one he would reveal not only that He is, but _what_ He<br> is as well. He did not have to be persuaded to discover Himself to<br> Moses. ‘And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,<br> and proclaimed the name of the Lord.’ He not only made a verbal<br> proclamation of His nature but He revealed His very Self to Moses so<br> that the skin of Moses' face shone with the supernatural light. It will<br> be a great moment for some of us when we begin to believe that God's<br> promise of self-revelation is literally true: that He promised much, but<br> promised no more than He intends to fulfill.<br><br> Our pursuit of God is successful just because He is forever seeking to<br> manifest Himself to us. The revelation of God to any man is not God<br> coming from a distance upon a time to pay a brief and momentous visit to<br> the man's soul. Thus to think of it is to misunderstand it all. The<br> approach of God to the soul or of the soul to God is not to be thought<br> of in spatial terms at all. There is no idea of physical distance<br> involved in the concept. It is not a matter of miles but of experience.<br><br> To speak of being near to or far from God is to use language in a sense<br> always understood when applied to our ordinary human relationships. A<br> man may say, ‘I feel that my son is coming nearer to me as he gets<br> older,’ and yet that son has lived by his father's side since he was<br> born and has never been away from home more than a day or so in his<br> entire life. What then can the father mean? Obviously he is speaking of<br> _experience_. He means that the boy is coming to know him more<br> intimately and with deeper understanding, that the barriers of thought<br> and feeling between the two are disappearing, that father and son are<br> becoming more closely united in mind and heart.<br><br> So when we sing, ‘Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,’ we are not<br> thinking of the nearness of place, but of the nearness of relationship.<br> It is for increasing degrees of awareness that we pray, for a more<br> perfect consciousness of the divine Presence. We need never shout across<br> the spaces to an absent God. He is nearer than our own soul, closer than<br> our most secret thoughts.<br><br> Why do some persons ‘find’ God in a way that others do not? Why does God<br> manifest His Presence to some and let multitudes of others struggle<br> along in the half-light of imperfect Christian experience? Of course the<br> will of God is the same for all. He has no favorites within His<br> household. All He has ever done for any of His children He will do for<br> all of His children. The difference lies not with God but with us.<br><br> Pick at random a score of great saints whose lives and testimonies are<br> widely known. Let them be Bible characters or well known Christians of<br> post-Biblical times. You will be struck instantly with the fact that<br> the saints were not alike. Sometimes the unlikenesses were so great as<br> to be positively glaring. How different for example was Moses from<br> Isaiah; how different was Elijah from David; how unlike each other were<br> John and Paul, St. Francis and Luther, Finney and Thomas à Kempis. The<br> differences are as wide as human life itself: differences of race,<br> nationality, education, temperament, habit and personal qualities. Yet<br> they all walked, each in his day, upon a high road of spiritual living<br> far above the common way.<br><br> Their differences must have been incidental and in the eyes of God of no<br> significance. In some vital quality they must have been alike. What was<br> it?<br><br> I venture to suggest that the one vital quality which they had in common<br> was _spiritual receptivity_. Something in them was open to heaven,<br> something which urged them Godward. Without attempting anything like a<br> profound analysis I shall say simply that they had spiritual awareness<br> and that they went on to cultivate it until it became the biggest thing<br> in their lives. They differed from the average person in that when they<br> felt the inward longing they _did something about it_. They acquired the<br> lifelong habit of spiritual response. They were not disobedient to the<br> heavenly vision. As David put it neatly, ‘When thou saidst, Seek ye my<br> face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.’<br><br> As with everything good in human life, back of this receptivity is God.<br> The sovereignty of God is here, and is felt even by those who have not<br> placed particular stress upon it theologically. The pious Michael Angelo<br> confessed this in a sonnet:<br><br> My unassisted heart is barren clay,<br> That of its native self can nothing feed:<br> Of good and pious works Thou art the seed,<br> That quickens only where Thou sayest it may:<br> Unless Thou show to us Thine own true way<br> No man can find it: Father! Thou must lead.<br><br> These words will repay study as the deep and serious testimony of a<br> great Christian.<br><br> Important as it is that we recognize God working in us, I would yet warn<br> against a too-great preoccupation with the thought. It is a sure road to<br> sterile passivity. God will not hold us responsible to understand the<br> mysteries of election, predestination and the divine sovereignty. The<br> best and safest way to deal with these truths is to raise our eyes to<br> God and in deepest reverence say, ‘O Lord, Thou knowest.’ Those things<br> belong to the deep and mysterious Profound of God's omniscience. Prying<br> into them may make theologians, but it will never make saints.<br><br> Receptivity is not a single thing; it is a compound rather, a blending<br> of several elements within the soul. It is an affinity for, a bent<br> toward, a sympathetic response to, a desire to have. From this it may be<br> gathered that it can be present in degrees, that we may have little or<br> more or less, depending upon the individual. It may be increased by<br> exercise or destroyed by neglect. It is not a sovereign and irresistible<br> force which comes upon us as a seizure from above. It is a gift of God,<br> indeed, but one which must be recognized and cultivated as any other<br> gift if it is to realize the purpose for which it was given.<br><br> Failure to see this is the cause of a very serious breakdown in modern<br> evangelicalism. The idea of cultivation and exercise, so dear to the<br> saints of old, has now no place in our total religious picture. It is<br> too slow, too common. We now demand glamour and fast flowing dramatic<br> action. A generation of Christians reared among push buttons and<br> automatic machines is impatient of slower and less direct methods of<br> reaching their goals. We have been trying to apply machine-age methods<br> to our relations with God. We read our chapter, have our short devotions<br> and rush away, hoping to make up for our deep inward bankruptcy by<br> attending another gospel meeting or listening to another thrilling story<br> told by a religious adventurer lately returned from afar.<br><br> The tragic results of this spirit are all about us. Shallow lives,<br> hollow religious philosophies, the preponderance of the element of fun<br> in gospel meetings, the glorification of men, trust in religious<br> externalities, quasi-religious fellowships, salesmanship methods, the<br> mistaking of dynamic personality for the power of the Spirit: these and<br> such as these are the symptoms of an evil disease, a deep and serious<br> malady of the soul.<br><br> For this great sickness that is upon us no one person is responsible,<br> and no Christian is wholly free from blame. We have all contributed,<br> directly or indirectly, to this sad state of affairs. We have been too<br> blind to see, or too timid to speak out, or too self-satisfied to desire<br> anything better than the poor average diet with which others appear<br> satisfied. To put it differently, we have accepted one another's<br> notions, copied one another's lives and made one another's experiences<br> the model for our own. And for a generation the trend has been downward.<br> Now we have reached a low place of sand and burnt wire grass and, worst<br> of all, we have made the Word of Truth conform to our experience and<br> accepted this low plane as the very pasture of the blessed.<br><br> It will require a determined heart and more than a little courage to<br> wrench ourselves loose from the grip of our times and return to Biblical<br> ways. But it can be done. Every now and then in the past Christians have<br> had to do it. History has recorded several large-scale returns led by<br> such men as St. Francis, Martin Luther and George Fox. Unfortunately<br> there seems to be no Luther or Fox on the horizon at present. Whether or<br> not another such return may be expected before the coming of Christ is a<br> question upon which Christians are not fully agreed, but that is not of<br> too great importance to us now.<br><br> What God in His sovereignty may yet do on a world-scale I do not claim<br> to know: but what He will do for the plain man or woman who seeks His<br> face I believe I do know and can tell others. Let any man turn to God in<br> earnest, let him begin to exercise himself unto godliness, let him seek<br> to develop his powers of spiritual receptivity by trust and obedience<br> and humility, and the results will exceed anything he may have hoped in<br> his leaner and weaker days.<br><br> Any man who by repentance and a sincere return to God will break himself<br> out of the mold in which he has been held, and will go to the Bible<br> itself for his spiritual standards, will be delighted with what he finds<br> there.<br><br> Let us say it again: The Universal Presence is a fact. God is here. The<br> whole universe is alive with His life. And He is no strange or foreign<br> God, but the familiar Father of our Lord Jesus Christ whose love has for<br> these thousands of years enfolded the sinful race of men. And always He<br> is trying to get our attention, to reveal Himself to us, to communicate<br> with us. We have within us the ability to know Him if we will but<br> respond to His overtures. (And this we call pursuing God!) We will know<br> Him in increasing degree as our receptivity becomes more perfect by<br> faith and love and practice.<br><br> _O God and Father, I repent of my sinful preoccupation with visible<br> things. The world has been too much with me. Thou hast been here and I<br> knew it not. I have been blind to Thy Presence. Open my eyes that I may<br> behold Thee in and around me. For Christ's sake, Amen._<br><br> <br><br> <br> VI<br><br> _The Speaking Voice_<br><br> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the<br> Word was God.--John 1:1<br><br> <br> An intelligent plain man, untaught in the truths of Christianity, coming<br> upon this text, would likely conclude that John meant to teach that it<br> is the nature of God to speak, to communicate His thoughts to others.<br> And he would be right. A word is a medium by which thoughts are<br> expressed, and the application of term to the Eternal Son leads us to<br> believe that self-expression is inherent in the Godhead, that God is<br> forever seeking to speak Himself out to His creation. The whole Bible<br> supports the idea. God is speaking. Not God spoke, but _God is<br> speaking_. He is by His nature continuously articulate. He fills the<br> world with His speaking Voice.<br><br> One of the great realities with which we have to deal is the Voice of<br> God in His world. The briefest and only satisfying cosmogony is this:<br> ‘He spake and it was done.’ The _why_ of natural law is the living Voice<br> of God immanent in His creation. And this word of God which brought all<br> worlds into being cannot be understood to mean the Bible, for it is not<br> a written or printed word at all, but the expression of the will of God<br> spoken into the structure of all things. This word of God is the breath<br> of God filling the world with living potentiality. The Voice of God is<br> the most powerful force in nature, indeed the only force in nature, for<br> all energy is here only because the power-filled Word is being spoken.<br><br> The Bible is the written word of God, and because it is written it is<br> confined and limited by the necessities of ink and paper and leather.<br> The Voice of God, however, is alive and free as the sovereign God is<br> free. ‘The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are<br> life.’ The life is in the speaking words. God's word in the Bible can<br> have power only because it corresponds to God's word in the universe. It<br> is the present Voice which makes the written Word all-powerful.<br> Otherwise it would lie locked in slumber within the covers of a book.<br><br> We take a low and primitive view of things when we conceive of God at<br> the creation coming into physical contact with things, shaping and<br> fitting and building like a carpenter. The Bible teaches otherwise: ‘By<br> the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by<br> the breath of his mouth.... For he spake, and it was done; he commanded,<br> and it stood fast.’ ‘Through faith we understand that the worlds were<br> framed by the word of God.’ Again we must remember that God is referring<br> here not to His written Word, but to His speaking Voice. His<br> world-filling Voice is meant, that Voice which antedates the Bible by<br> uncounted centuries, that Voice which has not been silent since the dawn<br> of creation, but is sounding still throughout the full far reaches of<br> the universe.<br><br> The Word of God is quick and powerful. In the beginning He spoke to<br> nothing, and it became _something_. Chaos heard it and became order,<br> darkness heard it and became light. ‘And God said--and it was so.’ These<br> twin phrases, as cause and effect, occur throughout the Genesis story of<br> the creation. The _said_ accounts for the _so_. The _so_ is the _said_<br> put into the continuous present.<br><br> That God is here and that He is speaking--these truths are back of all<br> other Bible truths; without them there could be no revelation at all.<br> God did not write a book and send it by messenger to be read at a<br> distance by unaided minds. He spoke a Book and lives in His spoken<br> words, constantly speaking His words and causing the power of them to<br> persist across the years. God breathed on clay and it became a man; He<br> breathes on men and they become clay. ‘Return ye children of men’ was<br> the word spoken at the Fall by which God decreed the death of every man,<br> and no added word has He needed to speak. The sad procession of mankind<br> across the face of the earth from birth to the grave is proof that His<br> original Word was enough.<br><br> We have not given sufficient attention to that deep utterance in the<br> Book of John, ‘That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that<br> cometh into the world.’ Shift the punctuation around as we will and the<br> truth is still there: the Word of God affects the hearts of all men as<br> light in the soul. In the hearts of all men the light shines, the Word<br> sounds, and there is no escaping them. Something like this would of<br> necessity be so if God is alive and in His world. And John says that it<br> is so. Even those persons who have never heard of the Bible have still<br> been preached to with sufficient clarity to remove every excuse from<br> their hearts forever. ‘Which show the work of the law written in their<br> hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the<br> mean while either accusing or else excusing one another.’ ‘For the<br> invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen,<br> being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and<br> Godhead; so that they are without excuse.’<br><br> This universal Voice of God was by the ancient Hebrews often called<br> Wisdom, and was said to be everywhere sounding and searching throughout<br> the earth, seeking some response from the sons of men. The eighth<br> chapter of the Book of Proverbs begins, ‘Doth not wisdom cry? and<br> understanding put forth her voice?’ The writer then pictures wisdom as a<br> beautiful woman standing ‘in the top of the high places, by the way in<br> the places of the paths.’ She sounds her voice from every quarter so<br> that no one may miss hearing it. ‘Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice<br> is to the sons of men.’ Then she pleads for the simple and the foolish<br> to give ear to her words. It is spiritual response for which this Wisdom<br> of God is pleading, a response which she has always sought and is but<br> rarely able to secure. The tragedy is that our eternal welfare depends<br> upon our hearing, and we have trained our ears not to hear.<br><br> This universal Voice has ever sounded, and it has often troubled men<br> even when they did not understand the source of their fears. Could it be<br> that this Voice distilling like a living mist upon the hearts of men has<br> been the undiscovered cause of the troubled conscience and the longing<br> for immortality confessed by millions since the dawn of recorded<br> history? We need not fear to face up to this. The speaking Voice is a<br> fact. How men have reacted to it is for any observer to note.<br><br> When God spoke out of heaven to our Lord, self-centered men who heard it<br> explained it by natural causes: they said, ‘It thundered.’ This habit<br> of explaining the Voice by appeals to natural law is at the very root of<br> modern science. In the living breathing cosmos there is a mysterious<br> Something, too wonderful, too awful for any mind to understand. The<br> believing man does not claim to understand. He falls to his knees and<br> whispers, ‘God.’ The man of earth kneels also, but not to worship. He<br> kneels to examine, to search, to find the cause and the how of things.<br> Just now we happen to be living in a secular age. Our thought habits are<br> those of the scientist, not those of the worshipper. We are more likely<br> to explain than to adore. ‘It thundered,’ we exclaim, and go our earthly<br> way. But still the Voice sounds and searches. The order and life of the<br> world depend upon that Voice, but men are mostly too busy or too<br> stubborn to give attention.<br><br> Everyone of us has had experiences which we have not been able to<br> explain: a sudden sense of loneliness, or a feeling of wonder or awe in<br> the face of the universal vastness. Or we have had a fleeting visitation<br> of light like an illumination from some other sun, giving us in a quick<br> flash an assurance that we are from another world, that our origins are<br> divine. What we saw there, or felt, or heard, may have been contrary to<br> all that we had been taught in the schools and at wide variance with all<br> our former beliefs and opinions. We were forced to suspend our acquired<br> doubts while, for a moment, the clouds were rolled back and we saw and<br> heard for ourselves. Explain such things as we will, I think we have not<br> been fair to the facts until we allow at least the possibility that such<br> experiences may arise from the Presence of God in the world and His<br> persistent effort to communicate with mankind. Let us not dismiss such<br> an hypothesis too flippantly.<br><br> It is my own belief (and here I shall not feel bad if no one follows me)<br> that every good and beautiful thing which man has produced in the world<br> has been the result of his faulty and sin-blocked response to the<br> creative Voice sounding over the earth. The moral philosophers who<br> dreamed their high dreams of virtue, the religious thinkers who<br> speculated about God and immortality, the poets and artists who created<br> out of common stuff pure and lasting beauty: how can we explain them? It<br> is not enough to say simply, ‘It was genius.’ What then is genius? Could<br> it be that a genius is a man haunted by the speaking Voice, laboring and<br> striving like one possessed to achieve ends which he only vaguely<br> understands? That the great man may have missed God in his labors, that<br> he may even have spoken or written against God does not destroy the idea<br> I am advancing. God's redemptive revelation in the Holy Scriptures is<br> necessary to saving faith and peace with God. Faith in a risen Saviour<br> is necessary if the vague stirrings toward immortality are to bring us<br> to restful and satisfying communion with God. To me this is a plausible<br> explanation of all that is best out of Christ. But you can be a good<br> Christian and not accept my thesis.<br><br> The Voice of God is a friendly Voice. No one need fear to listen to it<br> unless he has already made up his mind to resist it. The blood of Jesus<br> has covered not only the human race but all creation as well. ‘And<br> having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile<br> all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth,<br> or things in heaven.’ We may safely preach a friendly Heaven. The<br> heavens as well as the earth are filled with the good will of Him that<br> dwelt in the bush. The perfect blood of atonement secures this forever.<br><br> Whoever will listen will hear the speaking Heaven. This is definitely<br> not the hour when men take kindly to an exhortation to _listen_, for<br> listening is not today a part of popular religion. We are at the<br> opposite end of the pole from there. Religion has accepted the monstrous<br> heresy that noise, size, activity and bluster make a man dear to God.<br> But we may take heart. To a people caught in the tempest of the last<br> great conflict God says, ‘Be still, and know that I am God,’ and still<br> He says it, as if He means to tell us that our strength and safety lie<br> not in noise but in silence.<br><br> It is important that we get still to wait on God. And it is best that we<br> get alone, preferably with our Bible outspread before us. Then if we<br> will we may draw near to God and begin to hear Him speak to us in our<br> hearts. I think for the average person the progression will be something<br> like this: First a sound as of a Presence walking in the garden. Then a<br> voice, more intelligible, but still far from clear. Then the happy<br> moment when the Spirit begins to illuminate the Scriptures, and that<br> which had been only a sound, or at best a voice, now becomes an<br> intelligible word, warm and intimate and clear as the word of a dear<br> friend. Then will come life and light, and best of all, ability to see<br> and rest in and embrace Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord and All.<br><br> The Bible will never be a living Book to us until we are convinced that<br> God is articulate in His universe. To jump from a dead, impersonal world<br> to a dogmatic Bible is too much for most people. They may admit that<br> they _should_ accept the Bible as the Word of God, and they may try to<br> think of it as such, but they find it impossible to believe that the<br> words there on the page are actually for them. A man may _say_, ‘These<br> words are addressed to me,’ and yet in his heart not feel and know that<br> they are. He is the victim of a divided psychology. He tries to think of<br> God as mute everywhere else and vocal only in a book.<br><br> I believe that much of our religious unbelief is due to a wrong<br> conception of and a wrong feeling for the Scriptures of Truth. A silent<br> God suddenly began to speak in a book and when the book was finished<br> lapsed back into silence again forever. Now we read the book as the<br> record of what God said when He was for a brief time in a speaking mood.<br> With notions like that in our heads how can we believe? The facts are<br> that God is not silent, has never been silent. It is the nature of God<br> to speak. The second Person of the Holy Trinity is called the _Word_.<br> The Bible is the inevitable outcome of God's continuous speech. It is<br> the infallible declaration of His mind for us put into our familiar<br> human words.<br><br> I think a new world will arise out of the religious mists when we<br> approach our Bible with the idea that it is not only a book which was<br> once spoken, but a book which is _now speaking_. The prophets habitually<br> said, ‘Thus _saith_ the Lord.’ They meant their hearers to understand<br> that God's speaking is in the continuous present. We may use the past<br> tense properly to indicate that at a certain time a certain word of God<br> was spoken, but a word of God once spoken continues to be spoken, as a<br> child once born continues to be alive, or a world once created continues<br> to exist. And those are but imperfect illustrations, for children die<br> and worlds burn out, but the Word of our God endureth forever.<br><br> If you would follow on to know the Lord, come at once to the open Bible<br> expecting it to speak to you. Do not come with the notion that it is a<br> _thing_ which you may push around at your convenience. It is more than<br> a thing, it is a voice, a word, the very Word of the living God.<br><br> _Lord, teach me to listen. The times are noisy and my ears are weary<br> with the thousand raucous sounds which continuously assault them. Give<br> me the spirit of the boy Samuel when he said to Thee, ‘Speak, for thy<br> servant heareth.’ Let me hear Thee speaking in my heart. Let me get used<br> to the sound of Thy Voice, that its tones may be familiar when the<br> sounds of earth die away and the only sound will be the music of Thy<br> speaking Voice. Amen._<br><br> <br><br> <br> VII<br><br> _The Gaze of the Soul_<br><br> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.--Heb. 12:2<br><br> <br> Let us think of our intelligent plain man mentioned in chapter six<br> coming for the first time to the reading of the Scriptures. He<br> approaches the Bible without any previous knowledge of what it contains.<br> He is wholly without prejudice; he has nothing to prove and nothing to<br> defend.<br><br> Such a man will not have read long until his mind begins to observe<br> certain truths standing out from the page. They are the spiritual<br> principles behind the record of God's dealings with men, and woven into<br> the writings of holy men as they ‘were moved by the Holy Ghost.’ As he<br> reads on he might want to number these truths as they become clear to<br> him and make a brief summary under each number. These summaries will be<br> the tenets of his Biblical creed. Further reading will not affect these<br> points except to enlarge and strengthen them. Our man is finding out<br> what the Bible actually teaches.<br><br> High up on the list of things which the Bible teaches will be the<br> doctrine of _faith_. The place of weighty importance which the Bible<br> gives to faith will be too plain for him to miss. He will very likely<br> conclude: Faith is all-important in the life of the soul. Without faith<br> it is impossible to please God. Faith will get me anything, take me<br> anywhere in the Kingdom of God, but without faith there can be no<br> approach to God, no forgiveness, no deliverance, no salvation, no<br> communion, no spiritual life at all.<br><br> By the time our friend has reached the eleventh chapter of Hebrews the<br> eloquent encomium which is there pronounced upon faith will not seem<br> strange to him. He will have read Paul's powerful defense of faith in<br> his Roman and Galatian epistles. Later if he goes on to study church<br> history he will understand the amazing power in the teachings of the<br> Reformers as they showed the central place of faith in the Christian<br> religion.<br><br> Now if faith is so vitally important, if it is an indispensable _must_<br> in our pursuit of God, it is perfectly natural that we should be deeply<br> concerned over whether or not we possess this most precious gift. And<br> our minds being what they are, it is inevitable that sooner or later we<br> should get around to inquiring after the nature of faith. What _is_<br> faith? would lie close to the question, Do I _have_ faith? and would<br> demand an answer if it were anywhere to be found.<br><br> Almost all who preach or write on the subject of faith have much the<br> same things to say concerning it. They tell us that it is believing a<br> promise, that it is taking God at His word, that it is reckoning the<br> Bible to be true and stepping out upon it. The rest of the book or<br> sermon is usually taken up with stories of persons who have had their<br> prayers answered as a result of their faith. These answers are mostly<br> direct gifts of a practical and temporal nature such as health, money,<br> physical protection or success in business. Or if the teacher is of a<br> philosophic turn of mind he may take another course and lose us in a<br> welter of metaphysics or snow us under with psychological jargon as he<br> defines and re-defines, paring the slender hair of faith thinner and<br> thinner till it disappears in gossamer shavings at last. When he is<br> finished we get up disappointed and go out ‘by that same door where in<br> we went.’ Surely there must be something better than this.<br><br> In the Scriptures there is practically no effort made to define faith.<br> Outside of a brief fourteen-word definition in Hebrews 11:1, I know of<br> no Biblical definition, and even there faith is defined functionally,<br> not philosophically; that is, it is a statement of what faith is _in<br> operation_, _not_ what it is _in essence_. It assumes the presence of<br> faith and shows what it results in, rather than what it is. We will be<br> wise to go just that far and attempt to go no further. We are told from<br> whence it comes and by what means: ‘Faith is a gift of God,’ and ‘Faith<br> cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.’ This much is clear,<br> and, to paraphrase Thomas à Kempis, ‘I had rather exercise faith than<br> know the definition thereof.’<br><br> From here on, when the words ‘faith is’ or their equivalent occur in<br> this chapter I ask that they be understood to refer to what faith is in<br> operation as exercised by a believing man. Right here we drop the notion<br> of definition and think about faith as it may be experienced in action.<br> The complexion of our thoughts will be practical, not theoretical.<br><br> In a dramatic story in the Book of Numbers faith is seen in action.<br> Israel became discouraged and spoke against God, and the Lord sent fiery<br> serpents among them. ‘And they bit the people; and much people of Israel<br> died.’ Then Moses sought the Lord for them and He heard and gave them a<br> remedy against the bite of the serpents. He commanded Moses to make a<br> serpent of brass and put it upon a pole in sight of all the people, ‘and<br> it shall come to pass, that everyone that is bitten, when he looketh<br> upon it, shall live.’ Moses obeyed, ‘and it came to pass, that if a<br> serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he<br> lived’ (Num. 21:4-9).<br><br> In the New Testament this important bit of history is interpreted for us<br> by no less an authority than our Lord Jesus Christ Himself. He is<br> explaining to His hearers how they may be saved. He tells them that it<br> is by believing. Then to make it clear He refers to this incident in the<br> Book of Numbers. ‘As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even<br> so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him<br> should not perish, but have eternal life’ (John 3:14-15).<br><br> Our plain man in reading this would make an important discovery. He<br> would notice that ‘look’ and ‘believe’ were synonymous terms. ‘Looking’<br> on the Old Testament serpent is identical with ‘believing’ on the New<br> Testament Christ. That is, the _looking_ and the _believing_ are the<br> same thing. And he would understand that while Israel looked with their<br> external eyes, believing is done with the heart. I think he would<br> conclude that _faith is the gaze of a soul upon a saving God_.<br><br> When he had seen this he would remember passages he had read before, and<br> their meaning would come flooding over him. ‘They looked unto him, and<br> were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed’ (Psa. 34:5). ‘Unto<br> thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. Behold,<br> as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the<br> eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon<br> the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us’ (Psa. 123:1-2). Here<br> the man seeking mercy looks straight at the God of mercy and never takes<br> his eyes away from Him till mercy is granted. And our Lord Himself<br> looked always at God. ‘Looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and<br> gave the bread to his disciples’ (Matt. 14:19). Indeed Jesus taught that<br> He wrought His works by always keeping His inward eyes upon His Father.<br> His power lay in His continuous look at God (John 5:19-21).<br><br> In full accord with the few texts we have quoted is the whole tenor of<br> the inspired Word. It is summed up for us in the Hebrew epistle when we<br> are instructed to run life's race ‘looking unto Jesus the author and<br> finisher of our faith.’ From all this we learn that faith is not a<br> once-done act, but a continuous gaze of the heart at the Triune God.<br><br> Believing, then, is directing the heart's attention to Jesus. It is<br> lifting the mind to ‘behold the Lamb of God,’ and never ceasing that<br> beholding for the rest of our lives. At first this may be difficult, but<br> it becomes easier as we look steadily at His wondrous Person, quietly<br> and without strain. Distractions may hinder, but once the heart is<br> committed to Him, after each brief excursion away from Him the attention<br> will return again and rest upon Him like a wandering bird coming back to<br> its window.<br><br> I would emphasize this one committal, this one great volitional act<br> which establishes the heart's intention to gaze forever upon Jesus. God<br> takes this intention for our choice and makes what allowances He must<br> for the thousand distractions which beset us in this evil world. He<br> knows that we have set the direction of our hearts toward Jesus, and we<br> can know it too, and comfort ourselves with the knowledge that a habit<br> of soul is forming which will become after a while a sort of spiritual<br> reflex requiring no more conscious effort on our part.<br><br> Faith is the least self-regarding of the virtues. It is by its very<br> nature scarcely conscious of its own existence. Like the eye which sees<br> everything in front of it and never sees itself, faith is occupied with<br> the Object upon which it rests and pays no attention to itself at all.<br> While we are looking at God we do not see ourselves--blessed riddance.<br> The man who has struggled to purify himself and has had nothing but<br> repeated failures will experience real relief when he stops tinkering<br> with his soul and looks away to the perfect One. While he looks at<br> Christ the very things he has so long been trying to do will be getting<br> done within him. It will be God working in him to will and to do.<br><br> Faith is not in itself a meritorious act; the merit is in the One toward<br> Whom it is directed. Faith is a redirecting of our sight, a getting out<br> of the focus of our own vision and getting God into focus. Sin has<br> twisted our vision inward and made it self-regarding. Unbelief has put<br> self where God should be, and is perilously close to the sin of Lucifer<br> who said, ‘I will set my throne above the throne of God.’ Faith looks<br> _out_ instead of _in_ and the whole life falls into line.<br><br> All this may seem too simple. But we have no apology to make. To those<br> who would seek to climb into heaven after help or descend into hell God<br> says, ‘The word is nigh thee, even the word of faith.’ The word induces<br> us to lift up our eyes unto the Lord and the blessed work of faith<br> begins.<br><br> When we lift our inward eyes to gaze upon God we are sure to meet<br> friendly eyes gazing back at us, for it is written that the eyes of the<br> Lord run to and fro throughout all the earth. The sweet language of<br> experience is ‘Thou God seest me.’ When the eyes of the soul looking out<br> meet the eyes of God looking in, heaven has begun right here on this<br> earth.<br><br> ‘When all my endeavour is turned toward Thee because all Thy endeavour<br> is turned toward me; when I look unto Thee alone with all my attention,<br> nor ever turn aside the eyes of my mind, because Thou dost enfold me<br> with Thy constant regard; when I direct my love toward Thee alone<br> because Thou, who art Love's self hast turned Thee toward me alone. And<br> what, Lord, is my life, save that embrace wherein Thy delightsome<br> sweetness doth so lovingly enfold me?’[1] So wrote Nicholas of Cusa four<br> hundred years ago.<br><br> I should like to say more about this old man of God. He is not much<br> known today anywhere among Christian believers, and among current<br> Fundamentalists he is known not at all. I feel that we could gain much<br> from a little acquaintance with men of his spiritual flavor and the<br> school of Christian thought which they represent. Christian literature,<br> to be accepted and approved by the evangelical leaders of our times,<br> must follow very closely the same train of thought, a kind of ‘party<br> line’ from which it is scarcely safe to depart. A half-century of this<br> in America has made us smug and content. We imitate each other with<br> slavish devotion and our most strenuous efforts are put forth to try to<br> say the same thing that everyone around us is saying--and yet to find an<br> excuse for saying it, some little safe variation on the approved theme<br> or, if no more, at least a new illustration.<br><br> Nicholas was a true follower of Christ, a lover of the Lord, radiant and<br> shining in his devotion to the Person of Jesus. His theology was<br> orthodox, but fragrant and sweet as everything about Jesus might<br> properly be expected to be. His conception of eternal life, for<br> instance, is beautiful in itself and, if I mistake not, is nearer in<br> spirit to John 17:3 than that which is current among us today. Life<br> eternal, says Nicholas, is ‘nought other than that blessed regard<br> wherewith Thou never ceasest to behold me, yea, even the secret places<br> of my soul. With Thee, to behold is to give life; 'tis unceasingly to<br> impart sweetest love of Thee; 'tis to inflame me to love of Thee by<br> love's imparting, and to feed me by inflaming, and by feeding to kindle<br> my yearning, and by kindling to make me drink of the dew of gladness,<br> and by drinking to infuse in me a fountain of life, and by infusing to<br> make it increase and endure.’[2]<br><br> Now, if faith is the gaze of the heart at God, and if this gaze is but<br> the raising of the inward eyes to meet the all-seeing eyes of God, then<br> it follows that it is one of the easiest things possible to do. It would<br> be like God to make the most vital thing easy and place it within the<br> range of possibility for the weakest and poorest of us.<br><br> Several conclusions may fairly be drawn from all this. The simplicity of<br> it, for instance. Since believing is looking, it can be done without<br> special equipment or religious paraphernalia. God has seen to it that<br> the one life-and-death essential can never be subject to the caprice of<br> accident. Equipment can break down or get lost, water can leak away,<br> records can be destroyed by fire, the minister can be delayed or the<br> church burn down. All these are external to the soul and are subject to<br> accident or mechanical failure: but _looking_ is of the heart and can be<br> done successfully by any man standing up or kneeling down or lying in<br> his last agony a thousand miles from any church.<br><br> Since believing is looking it can be done _any time_. No season is<br> superior to another season for this sweetest of all acts. God never made<br> salvation depend upon new moons nor holy days or sabbaths. A man is not<br> nearer to Christ on Easter Sunday than he is, say, on Saturday, August<br> 3, or Monday, October 4. As long as Christ sits on the mediatorial<br> throne every day is a good day and all days are days of salvation.<br><br> Neither does _place_ matter in this blessed work of believing God. Lift<br> your heart and let it rest upon Jesus and you are instantly in a<br> sanctuary though it be a Pullman berth or a factory or a kitchen. You<br> can see God from anywhere if your mind is set to love and obey Him.<br><br> Now, someone may ask, ‘Is not this of which you speak for special<br> persons such as monks or ministers who have by the nature of their<br> calling more time to devote to quiet meditation? I am a busy worker and<br> have little time to spend alone.’ I am happy to say that the life I<br> describe is for everyone of God's children regardless of calling. It is,<br> in fact, happily practiced every day by many hard working persons and is<br> beyond the reach of none.<br><br> Many have found the secret of which I speak and, without giving much<br> thought to what is going on within them, constantly practice this habit<br> of inwardly gazing upon God. They know that something inside their<br> hearts sees God. Even when they are compelled to withdraw their<br> conscious attention in order to engage in earthly affairs there is<br> within them a secret communion always going on. Let their attention but<br> be released for a moment from necessary business and it flies at once to<br> God again. This has been the testimony of many Christians, so many that<br> even as I state it thus I have a feeling that I am quoting, though from<br> whom or from how many I cannot possibly know.<br><br> I do not want to leave the impression that the ordinary means of grace<br> have no value. They most assuredly have. Private prayer should be<br> practiced by every Christian. Long periods of Bible meditation will<br> purify our gaze and direct it; church attendance will enlarge our<br> outlook and increase our love for others. Service and work and activity;<br> all are good and should be engaged in by every Christian. But at the<br> bottom of all these things, giving meaning to them, will be the inward<br> habit of beholding God. A new set of eyes (so to speak) will develop<br> within us enabling us to be looking at God while our outward eyes are<br> seeing the scenes of this passing world.<br><br> Someone may fear that we are magnifying private religion out of all<br> proportion, that the ‘us’ of the New Testament is being displaced by a<br> selfish ‘I.’ Has it ever occurred to you that one hundred pianos all<br> tuned to the same fork are automatically tuned to each other? They are<br> of one accord by being tuned, not to each other, but to another standard<br> to which each one must individually bow. So one hundred worshippers met<br> together, each one looking away to Christ, are in heart nearer to each<br> other than they could possibly be were they to become ‘unity’ conscious<br> and turn their eyes away from God to strive for closer fellowship.<br> Social religion is perfected when private religion is purified. The body<br> becomes stronger as its members become healthier. The whole Church of<br> God gains when the members that compose it begin to seek a better and a<br> higher life.<br><br> All the foregoing presupposes true repentance and a full committal of<br> the life to God. It is hardly necessary to mention this, for only<br> persons who have made such a committal will have read this far.<br><br> When the habit of inwardly gazing Godward becomes fixed within us we<br> shall be ushered onto a new level of spiritual life more in keeping with<br> the promises of God and the mood of the New Testament. The Triune God<br> will be our dwelling place even while our feet walk the low road of<br> simple duty here among men. We will have found life's _summum bonum_<br> indeed. ‘There is the source of all delights that can be desired; not<br> only can nought better be thought out by men and angels, but nought<br> better can exist in mode of being! For it is the absolute maximum of<br> every rational desire, than which a greater cannot be.’[3]<br><br> _O Lord, I have heard a good word inviting me to look away to Thee and<br> be satisfied. My heart longs to respond, but sin has clouded my vision<br> till I see Thee but dimly. Be pleased to cleanse me in Thine own<br> precious blood, and make me inwardly pure, so that I may with unveiled<br> eyes gaze upon Thee all the days of my earthly pilgrimage. Then shall I<br> be prepared to behold Thee in full splendor in the day when Thou shalt<br> appear to be glorified in Thy saints and admired in all them that<br> believe. Amen._<br><br> FOOTNOTES:<br><br> [1] Nicholas of Cusa, _The Vision of God_, E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., New<br> York, 1928. This and the following quotations used by kind permission of<br> the publishers.<br><br> [2] _The Vision of God_<br><br> [3] _The Vision of God_<br><br> <br><br> <br> VIII<br><br> _Restoring the Creator-creature Relation_<br><br> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above<br> all the earth.--Psa. 57:5<br><br> <br> It is a truism to say that order in nature depends upon right<br> relationships; to achieve harmony each thing must be in its proper<br> position relative to each other thing. In human life it is not<br> otherwise.<br><br> I have hinted before in these chapters that the cause of all our human<br> miseries is a radical moral dislocation, an upset in our relation to God<br> and to each other. For whatever else the Fall may have been, it was most<br> certainly a sharp change in man's relation to his Creator. He adopted<br> toward God an altered attitude, and by so doing destroyed the proper<br> Creator-creature relation in which, unknown to him, his true happiness<br> lay. Essentially salvation is the restoration of a right relation<br> between man and his Creator, a bringing back to normal of the<br> Creator-creature relation.<br><br> A satisfactory spiritual life will begin with a complete change in<br> relation between God and the sinner; not a judicial change merely, but a<br> conscious and experienced change affecting the sinner's whole nature.<br> The atonement in Jesus' blood makes such a change judicially possible<br> and the working of the Holy Spirit makes it emotionally satisfying. The<br> story of the prodigal son perfectly illustrates this latter phase. He<br> had brought a world of trouble upon himself by forsaking the position<br> which he had properly held as son of his father. At bottom his<br> restoration was nothing more than a re-establishing of the father-son<br> relation which had existed from his birth and had been altered<br> temporarily by his act of sinful rebellion. This story overlooks the<br> legal aspects of redemption, but it makes beautifully clear the<br> experiential aspects of salvation.<br><br> In determining relationships we must begin somewhere. There must be<br> somewhere a fixed center against which everything else is measured,<br> where the law of relativity does not enter and we can say ‘IS’ and make<br> no allowances. Such a center is God. When God would make His Name known<br> to mankind He could find no better word than ‘I AM.’ When He speaks in<br> the first person He says, ‘I AM’; when we speak of Him we say, ‘He is’;<br> when we speak to Him we say, ‘Thou art.’ Everyone and everything else<br> measures from that fixed point. ‘I am that I am,’ says God, ‘I change not.’<br><br> As the sailor locates his position on the sea by ‘shooting’ the sun, so<br> we may get our moral bearings by looking at God. We must begin with God.<br> We are right when and only when we stand in a right position relative to<br> God, and we are wrong so far and so long as we stand in any other<br> position.<br><br> Much of our difficulty as seeking Christians stems from our<br> unwillingness to take God as He is and adjust our lives accordingly. We<br> insist upon trying to modify Him and to bring Him nearer to our own<br> image. The flesh whimpers against the rigor of God's inexorable sentence<br> and begs like Agag for a little mercy, a little indulgence of its carnal<br> ways. It is no use. We can get a right start only by accepting God as He<br> is and learning to love Him for what He is. As we go on to know Him<br> better we shall find it a source of unspeakable joy that God is just<br> what He is. Some of the most rapturous moments we know will be those we<br> spend in reverent admiration of the Godhead. In those holy moments the<br> very thought of change in Him will be too painful to endure.<br><br> So let us begin with God. Back of all, above all, before all is God;<br> first in sequential order, above in rank and station, exalted in dignity<br> and honor. As the self-existent One He gave being to all things, and all<br> things exist out of Him and for Him. ‘Thou art worthy, O Lord, to<br> receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things,<br> and for thy pleasure they are and were created.’<br><br> Every soul belongs to God and exists by His pleasure. God being Who and<br> What He is, and we being who and what we are, the only thinkable<br> relation between us is one of full lordship on His part and complete<br> submission on ours. We owe Him every honor that it is in our power to<br> give Him. Our everlasting grief lies in giving Him anything less.<br><br> The pursuit of God will embrace the labor of bringing our total<br> personality into conformity to His. And this not judicially, but<br> actually. I do not here refer to the act of justification by faith in<br> Christ. I speak of a voluntary exalting of God to His proper station<br> over us and a willing surrender of our whole being to the place of<br> worshipful submission which the Creator-creature circumstance makes<br> proper.<br><br> The moment we make up our minds that we are going on with this<br> determination to exalt God over all we step out of the world's parade.<br> We shall find ourselves out of adjustment to the ways of the world, and<br> increasingly so as we make progress in the holy way. We shall acquire a<br> new viewpoint; a new and different psychology will be formed within us;<br> a new power will begin to surprise us by its upsurgings and its<br> outgoings.<br><br> Our break with the world will be the direct outcome of our changed<br> relation to God. For the world of fallen men does not honor God.<br> Millions call themselves by His Name, it is true, and pay some token<br> respect to Him, but a simple test will show how little He is really<br> honored among them. Let the average man be put to the proof on the<br> question of who is _above_, and his true position will be exposed. Let<br> him be forced into making a choice between God and money, between God<br> and men, between God and personal ambition, God and self, God and human<br> love, and God will take second place every time. Those other things will<br> be exalted above. However the man may protest, the proof is in the<br> choices he makes day after day throughout his life.<br><br> ‘Be thou exalted’ is the language of victorious spiritual experience. It<br> is a little key to unlock the door to great treasures of grace. It is<br> central in the life of God in the soul. Let the seeking man reach a<br> place where life and lips join to say continually ‘Be thou exalted,’ and<br> a thousand minor problems will be solved at once. His Christian life<br> ceases to be the complicated thing it had been before and becomes the<br> very essence of simplicity. By the exercise of his will he has set his<br> course, and on that course he will stay as if guided by an automatic<br> pilot. If blown off course for a moment by some adverse wind he will<br> surely return again as by a secret bent of the soul. The hidden motions<br> of the Spirit are working in his favor, and ‘the stars in their courses’<br> fight for him. He has met his life problem at its center, and<br> everything else must follow along.<br><br> Let no one imagine that he will lose anything of human dignity by this<br> voluntary sell-out of his all to his God. He does not by this degrade<br> himself as a man; rather he finds his right place of high honor as one<br> made in the image of his Creator. His deep disgrace lay in his moral<br> derangement, his unnatural usurpation of the place of God. His honor<br> will be proved by restoring again that stolen throne. In exalting God<br> over all he finds his own highest honor upheld.<br><br> Anyone who might feel reluctant to surrender his will to the will of<br> another should remember Jesus' words, ‘Whosoever committeth sin is the<br> servant of sin.’ We must of necessity be servant to someone, either to<br> God or to sin. The sinner prides himself on his independence, completely<br> overlooking the fact that he is the weak slave of the sins that rule his<br> members. The man who surrenders to Christ exchanges a cruel slave driver<br> for a kind and gentle Master whose yoke is easy and whose burden is<br> light.<br><br> Made as we were in the image of God we scarcely find it strange to take<br> again our God as our All. God was our original habitat and our hearts<br> cannot but feel at home when they enter again that ancient and beautiful<br> abode.<br><br> I hope it is clear that there is a logic behind God's claim to<br> pre-eminence. That place is His by every right in earth or heaven. While<br> we take to ourselves the place that is His the whole course of our<br> lives is out of joint. Nothing will or can restore order till our hearts<br> make the great decision: God shall be exalted above.<br><br> ‘Them that honour me I will honour,’ said God once to a priest of<br> Israel, and that ancient law of the Kingdom stands today unchanged by<br> the passing of time or the changes of dispensation. The whole Bible and<br> every page of history proclaim the perpetuation of that law. ‘If any man<br> serve me, him will my Father honour,’ said our Lord Jesus, tying in the<br> old with the new and revealing the essential unity of His ways with men.<br><br> Sometimes the best way to see a thing is to look at its opposite. Eli<br> and his sons are placed in the priesthood with the stipulation that they<br> honor God in their lives and ministrations. This they fail to do, and<br> God sends Samuel to announce the consequences. Unknown to Eli this law<br> of reciprocal honor has been all the while secretly working, and now the<br> time has come for judgment to fall. Hophni and Phineas, the degenerate<br> priests, fall in battle, the wife of Hophni dies in childbirth, Israel<br> flees before her enemies, the ark of God is captured by the Philistines<br> and the old man Eli falls backward and dies of a broken neck. Thus stark<br> utter tragedy followed upon Eli's failure to honor God.<br><br> Now set over against this almost any Bible character who honestly tried<br> to glorify God in his earthly walk. See how God winked at weaknesses<br> and overlooked failures as He poured upon His servants grace and<br> blessing untold. Let it be Abraham, Jacob, David, Daniel, Elijah or whom<br> you will; honor followed honor as harvest the seed. The man of God set<br> his heart to exalt God above all; God accepted his intention as fact and<br> acted accordingly. Not perfection, but holy intention made the<br> difference.<br><br> In our Lord Jesus Christ this law was seen in simple perfection. In His<br> lowly manhood He humbled Himself and gladly gave all glory to His Father<br> in heaven. He sought not His own honor, but the honor of God who sent<br> Him. ‘If I honour myself,’ He said on one occasion, ‘my honour is<br> nothing; it is my Father that honoureth me.’ So far had the proud<br> Pharisees departed from this law that they could not understand one who<br> honored God at his own expense. ‘I honour my Father,’ said Jesus to<br> them, ‘and ye do dishonour me.’<br><br> Another saying of Jesus, and a most disturbing one, was put in the form<br> of a question, ‘How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another,<br> and seek not the honour that cometh from God alone?’ If I understand<br> this correctly Christ taught here the alarming doctrine that the desire<br> for honor among men made belief impossible. Is this sin at the root of<br> religious unbelief? Could it be that those ‘intellectual difficulties’<br> which men blame for their inability to believe are but smoke screens to<br> conceal the real cause that lies behind them? Was it this greedy desire<br> for honor from man that made men into Pharisees and Pharisees into<br> Deicides? Is this the secret back of religious self-righteousness and<br> empty worship? I believe it may be. The whole course of the life is<br> upset by failure to put God where He belongs. We exalt ourselves instead<br> of God and the curse follows.<br><br> In our desire after God let us keep always in mind that God also hath<br> desire, and His desire is toward the sons of men, and more particularly<br> toward those sons of men who will make the once-for-all decision to<br> exalt Him over all. Such as these are precious to God above all<br> treasures of earth or sea. In them God finds a theater where He can<br> display His exceeding kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. With them God<br> can walk unhindered, toward them He can act like the God He is.<br><br> In speaking thus I have one fear; it is that I may convince the mind<br> before God can win the heart. For this God-above-all position is one not<br> easy to take. The mind may approve it while not having the consent of<br> the will to put it into effect. While the imagination races ahead to<br> honor God, the will may lag behind and the man never guess how divided<br> his heart is. The whole man must make the decision before the heart can<br> know any real satisfaction. God wants us all, and He will not rest till<br> He gets us all. No part of the man will do.<br><br> Let us pray over this in detail, throwing ourselves at God's feet and<br> meaning everything we say. No one who prays thus in sincerity need wait<br> long for tokens of divine acceptance. God will unveil His glory before<br> His servant's eyes, and He will place all His treasures at the disposal<br> of such a one, for He knows that His honor is safe in such consecrated<br> hands.<br><br> _O God, be Thou exalted over my possessions. Nothing of earth's<br> treasures shall seem dear unto me if only Thou art glorified in my life.<br> Be Thou exalted over my friendships. I am determined that Thou shalt be<br> above all, though I must stand deserted and alone in the midst of the<br> earth. Be Thou exalted above my comforts. Though it mean the loss of<br> bodily comforts and the carrying of heavy crosses I shall keep my vow<br> made this day before Thee. Be Thou exalted over my reputation. Make me<br> ambitious to please Thee even if as a result I must sink into obscurity<br> and my name be forgotten as a dream. Rise, O Lord, into Thy proper place<br> of honor, above my ambitions, above my likes and dislikes, above my<br> family, my health and even my life itself. Let me decrease that Thou<br> mayest increase, let me sink that Thou mayest rise above. Ride forth<br> upon me as Thou didst ride into Jerusalem mounted upon the humble little<br> beast, a colt, the foal of an ass, and let me hear the children cry to<br> Thee, ‘Hosanna in the highest.’_<br><br> <br><br> <br> IX<br><br> _Meekness and Rest_<br><br> Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.--Matt. 5:5<br><br> <br> A fairly accurate description of the human race might be furnished one<br> unacquainted with it by taking the Beatitudes, turning them wrong side<br> out and saying, ‘Here is your human race.’ For the exact opposite of the<br> virtues in the Beatitudes are the very qualities which distinguish human<br> life and conduct.<br><br> In the world of men we find nothing approaching the virtues of which<br> Jesus spoke in the opening words of the famous Sermon on the Mount.<br> Instead of poverty of spirit we find the rankest kind of pride; instead<br> of mourners we find pleasure seekers; instead of meekness, arrogance;<br> instead of hunger after righteousness we hear men saying, ‘I am rich and<br> increased with goods and have need of nothing’; instead of mercy we find<br> cruelty; instead of purity of heart, corrupt imaginings; instead of<br> peacemakers we find men quarrelsome and resentful; instead of rejoicing<br> in mistreatment we find them fighting back with every weapon at their<br> command.<br><br> Of this kind of moral stuff civilized society is composed. The<br> atmosphere is charged with it; we breathe it with every breath and drink<br> it with our mother's milk. Culture and education refine these things<br> slightly but leave them basically untouched. A whole world of literature<br> has been created to justify this kind of life as the only normal one.<br> And this is the more to be wondered at seeing that these are the evils<br> which make life the bitter struggle it is for all of us. All our<br> heartaches and a great many of our physical ills spring directly out of<br> our sins. Pride, arrogance, resentfulness, evil imaginings, malice,<br> greed: these are the sources of more human pain than all the diseases<br> that ever afflicted mortal flesh.<br><br> Into a world like this the sound of Jesus' words comes wonderful and<br> strange, a visitation from above. It is well that He spoke, for no one<br> else could have done it as well; and it is good that we listen. His<br> words are the essence of truth. He is not offering an opinion; Jesus<br> never uttered opinions. He never guessed; He knew, and He knows. His<br> words are not as Solomon's were, the sum of sound wisdom or the results<br> of keen observation. He spoke out of the fulness of His Godhead, and His<br> words are very Truth itself. He is the only one who could say ‘blessed’<br> with complete authority, for He is the Blessed One come from the world<br> above to confer blessedness upon mankind. And His words were supported<br> by deeds mightier than any performed on this earth by any other man. It<br> is wisdom for us to listen.<br><br> As was often so with Jesus, He used this word ‘meek’ in a brief crisp<br> sentence, and not till some time later did He go on to explain it. In<br> the same book of Matthew He tells us more about it and applies it to our<br> lives. ‘Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will<br> give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and<br> lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is<br> easy, and my burden is light.’ Here we have two things standing in<br> contrast to each other, a burden and a rest. The burden is not a local<br> one, peculiar to those first hearers, but one which is borne by the<br> whole human race. It consists not of political oppression or poverty or<br> hard work. It is far deeper than that. It is felt by the rich as well as<br> the poor for it is something from which wealth and idleness can never<br> deliver us.<br><br> The burden borne by mankind is a heavy and a crushing thing. The word<br> Jesus used means a load carried or toil borne to the point of<br> exhaustion. Rest is simply release from that burden. It is not<br> something we do, it is what comes to us when we cease to do. His own<br> meekness, that is the rest.<br><br> Let us examine our burden. It is altogether an interior one. It attacks<br> the heart and the mind and reaches the body only from within. First,<br> there is the burden of _pride_. The labor of self-love is a heavy one<br> indeed. Think for yourself whether much of your sorrow has not arisen<br> from someone speaking slightingly of you. As long as you set yourself up<br> as a little god to which you must be loyal there will be those who will<br> delight to offer affront to your idol. How then can you hope to have<br> inward peace? The heart's fierce effort to protect itself from every<br> slight, to shield its touchy honor from the bad opinion of friend and<br> enemy, will never let the mind have rest. Continue this fight through<br> the years and the burden will become intolerable. Yet the sons of earth<br> are carrying this burden continually, challenging every word spoken<br> against them, cringing under every criticism, smarting under each<br> fancied slight, tossing sleepless if another is preferred before them.<br><br> Such a burden as this is not necessary to bear. Jesus calls us to His<br> rest, and meekness is His method. The meek man cares not at all who is<br> greater than he, for he has long ago decided that the esteem of the<br> world is not worth the effort. He develops toward himself a kindly sense<br> of humor and learns to say, ‘Oh, so you have been overlooked? They have<br> placed someone else before you? They have whispered that you are pretty<br> small stuff after all? And now you feel hurt because the world is saying<br> about you the very things you have been saying about yourself? Only<br> yesterday you were telling God that you were nothing, a mere worm of the<br> dust. Where is your consistency? Come on, humble yourself, and cease to<br> care what men think.’<br><br> The meek man is not a human mouse afflicted with a sense of his own<br> inferiority. Rather he may be in his moral life as bold as a lion and as<br> strong as Samson; but he has stopped being fooled about himself. He has<br> accepted God's estimate of his own life. He knows he is as weak and<br> helpless as God has declared him to be, but paradoxically, he knows at<br> the same time that he is in the sight of God of more importance than<br> angels. In himself, nothing; in God, everything. That is his motto. He<br> knows well that the world will never see him as God sees him and he has<br> stopped caring. He rests perfectly content to allow God to place His own<br> values. He will be patient to wait for the day when everything will get<br> its own price tag and real worth will come into its own. Then the<br> righteous shall shine forth in the Kingdom of their Father. He is<br> willing to wait for that day.<br><br> In the meantime he will have attained a place of soul rest. As he walks<br> on in meekness he will be happy to let God defend him. The old struggle<br> to defend himself is over. He has found the peace which meekness<br> brings.<br><br> Then also he will get deliverance from the burden of _pretense_. By this<br> I mean not hypocrisy, but the common human desire to put the best foot<br> forward and hide from the world our real inward poverty. For sin has<br> played many evil tricks upon us, and one has been the infusing into us a<br> false sense of shame. There is hardly a man or woman who dares to be<br> just what he or she is without doctoring up the impression. The fear of<br> being found out gnaws like rodents within their hearts. The man of<br> culture is haunted by the fear that he will some day come upon a man<br> more cultured than himself. The learned man fears to meet a man more<br> learned than he. The rich man sweats under the fear that his clothes or<br> his car or his house will sometime be made to look cheap by comparison<br> with those of another rich man. So-called ‘society’ runs by a motivation<br> not higher than this, and the poorer classes on their level are little<br> better.<br><br> Let no one smile this off. These burdens are real, and little by little<br> they kill the victims of this evil and unnatural way of life. And the<br> psychology created by years of this kind of thing makes true meekness<br> seem as unreal as a dream, as aloof as a star. To all the victims of the<br> gnawing disease Jesus says, ‘Ye must become as little children.’ For<br> little children do not compare; they receive direct enjoyment from what<br> they have without relating it to something else or someone else. Only<br> as they get older and sin begins to stir within their hearts do jealousy<br> and envy appear. Then they are unable to enjoy what they have if someone<br> else has something larger or better. At that early age does the galling<br> burden come down upon their tender souls, and it never leaves them till<br> Jesus sets them free.<br><br> Another source of burden is _artificiality_. I am sure that most people<br> live in secret fear that some day they will be careless and by chance an<br> enemy or friend will be allowed to peep into their poor empty souls. So<br> they are never relaxed. Bright people are tense and alert in fear that<br> they may be trapped into saying something common or stupid. Traveled<br> people are afraid that they may meet some Marco Polo who is able to<br> describe some remote place where they have never been.<br><br> This unnatural condition is part of our sad heritage of sin, but in our<br> day it is aggravated by our whole way of life. Advertising is largely<br> based upon this habit of pretense. ‘Courses’ are offered in this or that<br> field of human learning frankly appealing to the victim's desire to<br> shine at a party. Books are sold, clothes and cosmetics are peddled, by<br> playing continually upon this desire to appear what we are not.<br> Artificiality is one curse that will drop away the moment we kneel at<br> Jesus' feet and surrender ourselves to His meekness. Then we will not<br> care what people think of us so long as God is pleased. Then _what we<br> are_ will be everything; what we appear will take its place far down<br> the scale of interest for us. Apart from sin we have nothing of which to<br> be ashamed. Only an evil desire to shine makes us want to appear other<br> than we are.<br><br> The heart of the world is breaking under this load of pride and<br> pretense. There is no release from our burden apart from the meekness of<br> Christ. Good keen reasoning may help slightly, but so strong is this<br> vice that if we push it down one place it will come up somewhere else.<br> To men and women everywhere Jesus says, ‘Come unto me, and I will give<br> you rest.’ The rest He offers is the rest of meekness, the blessed<br> relief which comes when we accept ourselves for what we are and cease to<br> pretend. It will take some courage at first, but the needed grace will<br> come as we learn that we are sharing this new and easy yoke with the<br> strong Son of God Himself. He calls it ‘my yoke,’ and He walks at one<br> end while we walk at the other.<br><br> _Lord, make me childlike. Deliver me from the urge to compete with<br> another for place or prestige or position. I would be simple and artless<br> as a little child. Deliver me from pose and pretense. Forgive me for<br> thinking of myself. Help me to forget myself and find my true peace in<br> beholding Thee. That Thou mayest answer this prayer I humble myself<br> before Thee. Lay upon me Thy easy yoke of self-forgetfulness that<br> through it I may find rest. Amen._<br><br> <br><br> <br> X<br><br> _The Sacrament of Living_<br><br> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to<br> the glory of God.--I Cor. 10:31<br><br> <br> One of the greatest hindrances to internal peace which the Christian<br> encounters is the common habit of dividing our lives into two areas, the<br> sacred and the secular. As these areas are conceived to exist apart from<br> each other and to be morally and spiritually incompatible, and as we are<br> compelled by the necessities of living to be always crossing back and<br> forth from the one to the other, our inner lives tend to break up so<br> that we live a divided instead of a unified life.<br><br> Our trouble springs from the fact that we who follow Christ inhabit at<br> once two worlds, the spiritual and the natural. As children of Adam we<br> live our lives on earth subject to the limitations of the flesh and the<br> weaknesses and ills to which human nature is heir. Merely to live among<br> men requires of us years of hard toil and much care and attention to the<br> things of this world. In sharp contrast to this is our life in the<br> Spirit. There we enjoy another and higher kind of life; we are children<br> of God; we possess heavenly status and enjoy intimate fellowship with<br> Christ.<br><br> This tends to divide our total life into two departments. We come<br> unconsciously to recognize two sets of actions. The first are performed<br> with a feeling of satisfaction and a firm assurance that they are<br> pleasing to God. These are the sacred acts and they are usually thought<br> to be prayer, Bible reading, hymn singing, church attendance and such<br> other acts as spring directly from faith. They may be known by the fact<br> that they have no direct relation to this world, and would have no<br> meaning whatever except as faith shows us another world, ‘an house not<br> made with hands, eternal in the heavens.’<br><br> Over against these sacred acts are the secular ones. They include all of<br> the ordinary activities of life which we share with the sons and<br> daughters of Adam: eating, sleeping, working, looking after the needs of<br> the body and performing our dull and prosaic duties here on earth. These<br> we often do reluctantly and with many misgivings, often apologizing to<br> God for what we consider a waste of time and strength. The upshot of<br> this is that we are uneasy most of the time. We go about our common<br> tasks with a feeling of deep frustration, telling ourselves pensively<br> that there's a better day coming when we shall slough off this earthly<br> shell and be bothered no more with the affairs of this world.<br><br> This is the old sacred-secular antithesis. Most Christians are caught in<br> its trap. They cannot get a satisfactory adjustment between the claims<br> of the two worlds. They try to walk the tight rope between two kingdoms<br> and they find no peace in either. Their strength is reduced, their<br> outlook confused and their joy taken from them.<br><br> I believe this state of affairs to be wholly unnecessary. We have gotten<br> ourselves on the horns of a dilemma, true enough, but the dilemma is not<br> real. It is a creature of misunderstanding. The sacred-secular<br> antithesis has no foundation in the New Testament. Without doubt a more<br> perfect understanding of Christian truth will deliver us from it.<br><br> The Lord Jesus Christ Himself is our perfect example, and He knew no<br> divided life. In the Presence of His Father He lived on earth without<br> strain from babyhood to His death on the cross. God accepted the<br> offering of His total life, and made no distinction between act and act.<br> ‘I do always the things that please him,’ was His brief summary of His<br> own life as it related to the Father. As He moved among men He was<br> poised and restful. What pressure and suffering He endured grew out of<br> His position as the world's sin bearer; they were never the result of<br> moral uncertainty or spiritual maladjustment.<br><br> Paul's exhortation to ‘do all to the glory of God’ is more than pious<br> idealism. It is an integral part of the sacred revelation and is to be<br> accepted as the very Word of Truth. It opens before us the possibility<br> of making every act of our lives contribute to the glory of God. Lest we<br> should be too timid to include everything, Paul mentions specifically<br> eating and drinking. This humble privilege we share with the beasts that<br> perish. If these lowly animal acts can be so performed as to honor God,<br> then it becomes difficult to conceive of one that cannot.<br><br> That monkish hatred of the body which figures so prominently in the<br> works of certain early devotional writers is wholly without support in<br> the Word of God. Common modesty is found in the Sacred Scriptures, it is<br> true, but never prudery or a false sense of shame. The New Testament<br> accepts as a matter of course that in His incarnation our Lord took upon<br> Him a real human body, and no effort is made to steer around the<br> downright implications of such a fact. He lived in that body here among<br> men and never once performed a non-sacred act. His presence in human<br> flesh sweeps away forever the evil notion that there is about the human<br> body something innately offensive to the Deity. God created our bodies,<br> and we do not offend Him by placing the responsibility where it<br> belongs. He is not ashamed of the work of His own hands.<br><br> Perversion, misuse and abuse of our human powers should give us cause<br> enough to be ashamed. Bodily acts done in sin and contrary to nature can<br> never honor God. Wherever the human will introduces moral evil we have<br> no longer our innocent and harmless powers as God made them; we have<br> instead an abused and twisted thing which can never bring glory to its<br> Creator.<br><br> Let us, however, assume that perversion and abuse are not present. Let<br> us think of a Christian believer in whose life the twin wonders of<br> repentance and the new birth have been wrought. He is now living<br> according to the will of God as he understands it from the written Word.<br> Of such a one it may be said that every act of his life is or can be as<br> truly sacred as prayer or baptism or the Lord's Supper. To say this is<br> not to bring all acts down to one dead level; it is rather to lift every<br> act up into a living kingdom and turn the whole life into a sacrament.<br> If a sacrament is an external expression of an inward grace than we need<br> not hesitate to accept the above thesis. By one act of consecration of<br> our total selves to God we can make every subsequent act express that<br> consecration. We need no more be ashamed of our body--the fleshly<br> servant that carries us through life--than Jesus was of the humble beast<br> upon which He rode into Jerusalem. ‘The Lord hath need of him’ may well<br> apply to our mortal bodies. If Christ dwells in us we may bear about the<br> Lord of glory as the little beast did of old and give occasion to the<br> multitudes to cry, ‘Hosanna in the highest.’<br><br> That we _see_ this truth is not enough. If we would escape from the<br> toils of the sacred-secular dilemma the truth must ‘run in our blood’<br> and condition the complexion of our thoughts. We must practice living to<br> the glory of God, actually and determinedly. By meditation upon this<br> truth, by talking it over with God often in our prayers, by recalling it<br> to our minds frequently as we move about among men, a _sense_ of its<br> wondrous meaning will begin to take hold of us. The old painful duality<br> will go down before a restful unity of life. The knowledge that we are<br> all God's, that He has received all and rejected nothing, will unify our<br> inner lives and make everything sacred to us.<br><br> This is not quite all. Long-held habits do not die easily. It will take<br> intelligent thought and a great deal of reverent prayer to escape<br> completely from the sacred-secular psychology. For instance it may be<br> difficult for the average Christian to get hold of the idea that his<br> daily labors can be performed as acts of worship acceptable to God by<br> Jesus Christ. The old antithesis will crop up in the back of his head<br> sometimes to disturb his peace of mind. Nor will that old serpent the<br> devil take all this lying down. He will be there in the cab or at the<br> desk or in the field to remind the Christian that he is giving the<br> better part of his day to the things of this world and allotting to his<br> religious duties only a trifling portion of his time. And unless great<br> care is taken this will create confusion and bring discouragement and<br> heaviness of heart.<br><br> We can meet this successfully only by the exercise of an aggressive<br> faith. We must offer all our acts to God and believe that He accepts<br> them. Then hold firmly to that position and keep insisting that every<br> act of every hour of the day and night be included in the transaction.<br> Keep reminding God in our times of private prayer that we mean every act<br> for His glory; then supplement those times by a thousand thought-prayers<br> as we go about the job of living. Let us practice the fine art of making<br> every work a priestly ministration. Let us believe that God is in all<br> our simple deeds and learn to find Him there.<br><br> A concomitant of the error which we have been discussing is the<br> sacred-secular antithesis as applied to places. It is little short of<br> astonishing that we can read the New Testament and still believe in the<br> inherent sacredness of places as distinguished from other places. This<br> error is so widespread that one feels all alone when he tries to combat<br> it. It has acted as a kind of dye to color the thinking of religious<br> persons and has colored the eyes as well so that it is all but<br> impossible to detect its fallacy. In the face of every New Testament<br> teaching to the contrary it has been said and sung throughout the<br> centuries and accepted as a part of the Christian message, the which it<br> most surely is not. Only the Quakers, so far as my knowledge goes, have<br> had the perception to see the error and the courage to expose it.<br><br> Here are the facts as I see them. For four hundred years Israel had<br> dwelt in Egypt, surrounded by the crassest idolatry. By the hand of<br> Moses they were brought out at last and started toward the land of<br> promise. The very idea of holiness had been lost to them. To correct<br> this, God began at the bottom. He localized Himself in the cloud and<br> fire and later when the tabernacle had been built He dwelt in fiery<br> manifestation in the Holy of Holies. By innumerable distinctions God<br> taught Israel the difference between holy and unholy. There were holy<br> days, holy vessels, holy garments. There were washings, sacrifices,<br> offerings of many kinds. By these means Israel learned that _God is<br> holy_. It was this that He was teaching them. Not the holiness of things<br> or places, but the holiness of Jehovah was the lesson they must learn.<br><br> Then came the great day when Christ appeared. Immediately He began to<br> say, ‘Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time--but _I_ say<br> unto you.’ The Old Testament schooling was over. When Christ died on the<br> cross the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom. The Holy of<br> Holies was opened to everyone who would enter in faith. Christ's words<br> were remembered, ‘The hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this<br> mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.... But the hour<br> cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father<br> in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God<br> is Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in<br> truth.’<br><br> Shortly after, Paul took up the cry of liberty and declared all meats<br> clean, every day holy, all places sacred and every act acceptable to<br> God. The sacredness of times and places, a half-light necessary to the<br> education of the race, passed away before the full sun of spiritual<br> worship.<br><br> The essential spirituality of worship remained the possession of the<br> Church until it was slowly lost with the passing of the years. Then the<br> natural _legality_ of the fallen hearts of men began to introduce the<br> old distinctions. The Church came to observe again days and seasons and<br> times. Certain places were chosen and marked out as holy in a special<br> sense. Differences were observed between one and another day or place or<br> person, ‘The sacraments’ were first two, then three, then four until<br> with the triumph of Romanism they were fixed at seven.<br><br> In all charity, and with no desire to reflect unkindly upon any<br> Christian, however misled, I would point out that the Roman Catholic<br> church represents today the sacred-secular heresy carried to its<br> logical conclusion. Its deadliest effect is the complete cleavage it<br> introduces between religion and life. Its teachers attempt to avoid this<br> snare by many footnotes and multitudinous explanations, but the mind's<br> instinct for logic is too strong. In practical living the cleavage is a<br> fact.<br><br> From this bondage reformers and puritans and mystics have labored to<br> free us. Today the trend in conservative circles is back toward that<br> bondage again. It is said that a horse after it has been led out of a<br> burning building will sometimes by a strange obstinacy break loose from<br> its rescuer and dash back into the building again to perish in the<br> flame. By some such stubborn tendency toward error Fundamentalism in our<br> day is moving back toward spiritual slavery. The observation of days and<br> times is becoming more and more prominent among us. ‘Lent’ and ‘holy<br> week’ and ‘good’ Friday are words heard more and more frequently upon<br> the lips of gospel Christians. We do not know when we are well off.<br><br> In order that I may be understood and not be misunderstood I would throw<br> into relief the practical implications of the teaching for which I have<br> been arguing, i.e., the sacramental quality of every day living. Over<br> against its positive meanings I should like to point out a few things it<br> does not mean.<br><br> It does not mean, for instance, that everything we do is of equal<br> importance with everything else we do or may do. One act of a good<br> man's life may differ widely from another in importance. Paul's sewing<br> of tents was not equal to his writing of an Epistle to the Romans, but<br> both were accepted of God and both were true acts of worship. Certainly<br> it is more important to lead a soul to Christ than to plant a garden,<br> but the planting of the garden _can_ be as holy an act as the winning of<br> a soul.<br><br> Again, it does not mean that every man is as useful as every other man.<br> Gifts differ in the body of Christ. A Billy Bray is not to be compared<br> with a Luther or a Wesley for sheer usefulness to the Church and to the<br> world; but the service of the less gifted brother is as pure as that of<br> the more gifted, and God accepts both with equal pleasure.<br><br> The ‘layman’ need never think of his humbler task as being inferior to<br> that of his minister. Let every man abide in the calling wherein he is<br> called and his work will be as sacred as the work of the ministry. It is<br> not what a man does that determines whether his work is sacred or<br> secular, it is _why_ he does it. The motive is everything. Let a man<br> sanctify the Lord God in his heart and he can thereafter do no common<br> act. All he does is good and acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For<br> such a man, living itself will be sacramental and the whole world a<br> sanctuary. His entire life will be a priestly ministration. As he<br> performs his never so simple task he will hear the voice of the seraphim<br> saying, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is<br> full of his glory.’<br><br> _Lord, I would trust Thee completely; I would be altogether Thine; I<br> would exalt Thee above all. I desire that I may feel no sense of<br> possessing anything outside of Thee. I want constantly to be aware of<br> Thy overshadowing Presence and to hear Thy speaking Voice. I long to<br> live in restful sincerity of heart. I want to live so fully in the<br> Spirit that all my thought may be as sweet incense ascending to Thee and<br> every act of my life may be an act of worship. Therefore I pray in the<br> words of Thy great servant of old, ‘I beseech Thee so for to cleanse the<br> intent of mine heart with the unspeakable gift of Thy grace, that I may<br> perfectly love Thee and worthily praise Thee.’ And all this I<br> confidently believe Thou wilt grant me through the merits of Jesus<br> Christ Thy Son. Amen."}
