We are selfish men;<br> Oh! raise us up, return to us again;<br> And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.<br> Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart:<br> Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:<br> Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,<br> So didst thou travel on life's common way,<br> In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart<br> The lowliest duties on herself did lay."
