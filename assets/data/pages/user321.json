				"main_text": "This little bowl is like a mossy pool<br>In a Spring wood, where dogtooth violets grow<br>Nodding in chequered sunshine of the trees;<br>A quiet place, still, with the sound of birds,<br>Where, though unseen, is heard the endless song<br>And murmur of the never resting sea.<br>'T was winter, Roger, when you made this cup,<br>But coming Spring guided your eager hand<br>And round the edge you fashioned young green leaves,<br>A proper chalice made to hold the shy<br>And little flowers of the woods. And here<br>They will forget their sad uprooting, lost<br>In pleasure that this circle of bright leaves<br>Should be their setting; once more they will dream<br>They hear winds wandering through lofty trees<br>And see the sun smiling between the leaves."
