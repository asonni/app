				"main_text": "Drunk as drunk on turpentine<br>From your open kisses,<br>Your wet body wedged<br>Between my wet body and the strake<br>Of our boat that is made of flowers,<br>Feasted, we guide it - our fingers<br>Like tallows adorned with yellow metal -<br>Over the sky's hot rim,<br>The day's last breath in our sails.<br><br>Pinned by the sun between solstice<br>And equinox, drowsy and tangled together<br>We drifted for months and woke<br>With the bitter taste of land on our lips,<br>Eyelids all sticky, and we longed for lime<br>And the sound of a rope<br>Lowering a bucket down its well. Then,<br>We came by night to the Fortunate Isles,<br>And lay like fish<br>Under the net of our kisses."
