	"main_text":"I SAW Eternity the other night, <br><br> Like a great ring of pure and endless light, <br><br> All calm, as it was bright ; <br><br> And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years <br><br> Driv'n by the spheres <br><br> Like a vast shadow mov'd ; in which the world <br><br> And all her train were hurl'd. <br><br> The doting lover in his quaintest strain <br><br> Did there complain ; <br><br> Near him, his lute, his fancy, and his flights, <br><br> Wit's sour delights ; <br><br> With gloves, and knots, the silly snares of pleasure, <br><br> Yet his dear treasure, <br><br> All scatter'd lay, while he his eyes did pour <br><br> Upon a flow'r. <br><br><br><br> <br><br> The darksome statesman, hung with weights and woe, <br><br> Like a thick midnight-fog, mov'd there so slow, <br><br> He did nor stay, nor go ; <br><br> Condemning thoughts-like sad eclipses-scowl <br><br> Upon his soul, <br><br> And clouds of crying witnesses without <br><br> Pursued him with one shout. <br><br> Yet digg'd the mole, and lest his ways be found, <br><br> Work'd under ground, <br><br> Where he did clutch his prey but one did see <br><br> That policy : <br><br> Churches and altars fed him perjuries <br><br> Were gnats and flies <br><br> It rain'd about him blood and tears, but he <br><br> Drank them as free. <br><br><br><br> <br><br> The fearful miser on a heap of rust <br><br> Sate pining all his life there, did scarce trust <br><br> His own hands with the dust, <br><br> Yet would not place one piece above, but lives <br><br> In fear of thieves. <br><br> Thousands there were as frantic as himself, <br><br> And hugg'd each one his pelf <br><br> The downright epicure plac'd heav'n in sense, <br><br> And scorn'd pretence <br><br> While others, slipp'd into a wide excess <br><br> Said little less <br><br> The weaker sort slight, trivial wares enslave, <br><br> Who think them brave <br><br> And poor, despis&egraved Truth sate counting by <br><br> Their victory. <br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br> Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing, <br><br> And sing, and weep, soar'd up into the ring <br><br> But most would use no wing. <br><br> O fools-said I-thus to prefer dark night <br><br> Before true light ! <br><br> To live in grots and caves, and hate the day <br><br> Because it shows the way <br><br> The way, which from this dead and dark abode <br><br> Leads up to God <br><br> A way where you might tread the sun, and be <br><br> More bright than he ! <br><br> But as I did their madness so discuss, <br><br> One whisper'd thus, <br><br> 'This ring the Bridegroom did for none provide, <br><br> But for His bride.&rdquo; <br><br><br><br> JOHN, CAP. 2. VER. 16, 17. <br><br> All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the <br><br> lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the <br><br> Father, but is of the world. <br><br> And the world passeth away, and the lusts thereof <br><br> but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.",
