Then,<br>We came by night to the Fortunate Isles,<br>And lay like fish<br>Under the net of our kisses.</p><br>I want you to know<br>one thing.<br><br>You know how this is:<br>if I look<br>at the crystal moon, at the red branch<br>of the slow autumn at my window,<br>if I touch<br>near the fire<br>the impalpable ash<br>or the wrinkled body of the log,<br>everything carries me to you,<br>as if everything that exists,<br>aromas, light, metals,<br>were little boats<br>that sail<br>toward those isles of yours that wait for me.<br><br>Well, now,<br>if little by little you stop loving me<br>I shall stop loving you little by little.<br><br>If suddenly<br>you forget me<br>do not look for me,<br>for I shall already have forgotten you.<br><br>If you think it long and mad,<br>the wind of banners<br>that passes through my life,<br>and you decide<br>to leave me at the shore<br>of the heart where I have roots,<br>remember<br>that on that day,<br>at that hour,<br>I shall lift my arms<br>and my roots will set off<br>to seek another land.<br><br>But<br>if each day,<br>each hour,<br>you feel that you are destined for me<br>with implacable sweetness,<br>if each day a flower<br>climbs up to your lips to seek me,<br>ah my love, ah my own,<br>in me all that fire is repeated,<br>in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,<br>my love feeds on your love, beloved,<br>and as long as you live it will be in your arms<br>without leaving mine</p><br>It so happens I am sick of being a man.<br>And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie<br>houses<br>dried up, waterproof, like a swan made of felt<br>steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes.<br><br>The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse<br>sobs.<br>The only thing I want is to lie still like stones or wool.<br>The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens,<br>no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators.<br><br>It so happens that I am sick of my feet and my nails<br>and my hair and my shadow.<br>It so happens I am sick of being a man.<br><br>Still it would be marvelous<br>to terrify a law clerk with a cut lily,<br>or kill a nun with a blow on the ear.<br>It would be great<br>to go through the streets with a green knife<br>letting out yells until I died of the cold.<br><br>I don't want to go on being a root in the dark,<br>insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep,<br>going on down, into the moist guts of the earth,<br>taking in and thinking, eating every day.<br><br>I don't want so much misery.<br>I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb,<br>alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses,<br>half frozen, dying of grief.<br><br>That's why Monday, when it sees me coming<br>with my convict face, blazes up like gasoline,<br>and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel,<br>and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the<br>night.<br><br>And it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist<br>houses,<br>into hospitals where the bones fly out the window,<br>into shoeshops that smell like vinegar,<br>and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin.<br><br>There are sulphur-colored birds, and hideous intestines<br>hanging over the doors of houses that I hate,<br>and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot,<br>there are mirrors<br>that ought to have wept from shame and terror,<br>there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical<br>cords.<br><br>I stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes,<br>my rage, forgetting everything,<br>I walk by, going through office buildings and orthopedic<br>shops,<br>and courtyards with washing hanging from the line:<br>underwear, towels and shirts from which slow<br>dirty tears are falling.</p><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br><br>Write, for example, 'The night is starry<br>and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'<br><br>The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br><br>Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.<br>I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br><br>She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.<br>How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.<br><br>To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.<br>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br><br>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br>The night is starry and she is not with me.<br><br>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br>My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br>My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br><br>The same night whitening the same trees.<br>We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.<br>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.<br><br>Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.<br>Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br>Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br><br>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br>my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br>and these the last verses that I write for her.</p>"}
