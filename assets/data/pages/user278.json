What the chain?<br>In what furnace was thy brain?<br>What the anvil? What dread grasp<br>Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br><br>When the stars threw down their spears,<br>And water'd heaven with their tears,<br>Did He smile His work to see?<br>Did He who made the lamb make thee?<br><br>Tyger, Tyger burning bright<br>In the forests of the night,<br>What immortal hand or eye<br>Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?"
