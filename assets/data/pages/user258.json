				"main_text": "'O Jesus Christ! I'm hit,' he said; and died.<br>Whether he vainly cursed, or prayed indeed,<br>The Bullets chirped - 'In vain! vain! vain!'<br>Machine-guns chuckled, 'Tut-tut! Tut-tut!'<br>And the Big Gun guffawed.<br><br>Another sighed, - 'O Mother, Mother! Dad!'<br>Then smiled, at nothing, childlike, being dead.<br>And the lofty Shrapnel-cloud<br>Leisurely gestured, - 'Fool!'<br>And the falling splinters tittered.<br><br>'My Love!' one moaned. Love-languid seemed his mood,<br>Till, slowly lowered, his whole face kissed the mud.<br>And the Bayonets' long teeth grinned;<br>Rabbles of Shells hooted and groaned;<br>And the Gas hissed."
