				"main_text": "Where the slow river <br> meets the tide, <br> a red swan lifts red wings <br> and darker beak, <br> and underneath the purple down <br> of his soft breast <br> uncurls his coral feet. <br><br> Through the deep purple <br> of the dying heat <br> of sun and mist, <br> the level ray of sun-beam <br> has caressed <br> the lily with dark breast, <br> and flecked with richer gold <br> its golden crest. <br><br> Where the slow lifting <br> of the tide, <br> floats into the river <br> and slowly drifts <br> among the reeds, <br> and lifts the yellow flags, <br> he floats <br> where tide and river meet. <br><br> Ah kingly kiss -- <br> no more regret <br> nor old deep memories <br> to mar the bliss; <br> where the low sedge is thick, <br> the gold day-lily <br> outspreads and rests <br> beneath soft fluttering <br> of red swan wings <br> and the warm quivering <br> of the red swan's breast."
