One, two! And through and through<br> The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br> He left it dead, and with its head<br> He went galumphing back.<br><br> 'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br> Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br> O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br> He chortled in his joy.<br><br> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br> Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br> All mimsy were the borogoves,<br> And the mome raths outgrabe."
