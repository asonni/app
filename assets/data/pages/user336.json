				"main_text": "Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art- <br> Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night, <br> And watching, with eternal lids apart, <br> Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite, <br> The moving waters at their priestlike task <br> Of pure ablution round earth's human shores, <br> Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask <br> Of snow upon the mountains and the moors- <br> No-yet still steadfast, still unchangeable, <br> Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast, <br> To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, <br> Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, <br> Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, <br> And so live ever-or else swoon to death."
