				"main_text": "This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary.<br>The trees of the mind are black. The light is blue.<br>The grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God,<br>Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility.<br>Fumy, spirituous mists inhabit this place<br>Separated from my house by a row of headstones.<br>I simply cannot see where there is to get to.<br><br>The moon is no door. It is a face in its own right,<br>White as a knuckle and terribly upset.<br>It drags the sea after it like a dark crime; it is quiet<br>With the O-gape of complete despair. I live here.<br>Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky-<br>Eight great tongues affirming the Resurrection.<br>At the end, they soberly bong out their names.<br><br>The yew tree points up. It has a Gothic shape.<br>The eyes lift after it and find the moon.<br>The moon is my mother. She is not sweet like Mary.<br>Her blue garments unloose small bats and owls.<br>How I would like to believe in tenderness-<br>The face of the effigy, gentled by candles,<br>Bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes.<br><br>I have fallen a long way. Clouds are flowering<br>Blue and mystical over the face of the stars.<br>Inside the church, the saints will be all blue,<br>Floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,<br>Their hands and faces stiff with holiness.<br>The moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild.<br>And the message of the yew tree is blackness-blackness and silence."
