	"main_text":"The Frost performs its secret ministry,<br><br> Unhelped by any wind. The owlet's cry<br><br> Came loud, -and hark, again! loud as before.<br><br> The inmates of my cottage, all at rest,<br><br> Have left me to that solitude, which suits<br><br> Abstruser musings: save that at my side<br><br> My cradled infant slumbers peacefully.<br><br> 'Tis calm indeed! so calm, that it disturbs<br><br> And vexes meditation with its strange<br><br> And extreme silentness. Sea, hill, and wood,<br><br> With all the numberless goings-on of life,<br><br> Inaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame<br><br> Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not;<br><br> Only that film, which fluttered on the grate,<br><br> Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing.<br><br> Methinks its motion in this hush of nature<br><br> Gives it dim sympathies with me who live,<br><br> Making it a companionable form,<br><br> Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit<br><br> By its own moods interprets, every where<br><br> Echo or mirror seeking of itself,<br><br> And makes a toy of Thought.<br><br><br><br>But O! how oft,<br><br> How oft, at school, with most believing mind,<br><br> Presageful, have I gazed upon the bars,<br><br> To watch that fluttering stranger! and as oft<br><br> With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt<br><br> Of my sweet birthplace, and the old church-tower,<br><br> Whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang<br><br> From morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day,<br><br> So sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me<br><br> With a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear<br><br> Most like articulate sounds of things to come!<br><br> So gazed I, till the soothing things, I dreamt,<br><br> Lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams!<br><br> And so I brooded all the following morn,<br><br> Awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye<br><br> Fixed with mock study on my swimming book:<br><br> Save if the door half opened, and I snatched<br><br> A hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up,<br><br> For still I hoped to see the stranger's face,<br><br> Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved,<br><br> My playmate when we both were clothed alike!<br><br><br><br>Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,<br><br> Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,<br><br> Fill up the interspersed vacancies<br><br> And momentary pauses of the thought!<br><br> My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart<br><br> With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,<br><br> And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,<br><br> And in far other scenes! For I was reared<br><br> In the great city, pent mid cloisters dim,<br><br> And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.<br><br> But thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze<br><br> By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags<br><br> Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds,<br><br> Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores<br><br> And mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear<br><br> The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible<br><br> Of that eternal language, which thy God<br><br> Utters, who from eternity doth teach<br><br> Himself in all, and all things in himself.<br><br> Great universal Teacher! he shall mould<br><br> Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.<br><br><br><br>Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,<br><br> Whether the summer clothe the general earth<br><br> With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing<br><br> Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch<br><br> Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch<br><br> Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall<br><br> Heard only in the trances of the blast,<br><br> Or if the secret ministry of frost<br><br> Shall hang them up in silent icicles,<br><br> Quietly shining to the quiet Moon.",
