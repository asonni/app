For the loftiest hill,<br> Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,<br><br> Planting his stedfast footsteps in the sea,<br> Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,<br> Spares but the cloudy border of his base<br> To the foiled searching of mortality;<br><br> And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,<br> Self-schooled, self-scanned, self-honored, self-secure,<br> Didst tread on earth unguessed at-;better so!<br><br> All pains the immortal spirit must endure,<br> All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,<br> Find their sole speech in that victorious brow."
