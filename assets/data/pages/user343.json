				"main_text": "He held no dream worth waking; so he said,<br> He who stands now on death's triumphal steep,<br> Awakened out of life wherein we sleep<br> And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead.<br> But never death for him was dark or dread;<br> ';Look forth,'; he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep,<br> All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep<br> Vain memory's vision of a vanished head<br> As all that lives of all that once was he<br> Save that which lightens from his word; but we,<br> Who, seeing the sunset-colored waters roll,<br> Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea,<br> Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole,<br> And life and death but shadows of the soul."
