				"main_text": "A wanderer is man from his birth.<br> He was born in a ship<br> On the breast of the river of Time;<br> Brimming with wonder and joy<br> He spreads out his arms to the light,<br> Rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream.<br><br> As what he sees is, so have his thoughts been.<br> Whether he wakes,<br> Where the snowy mountainous pass,<br> Echoing the screams of the eagles,<br> Hems in its gorges the bed<br> Of the new-born clear-flowing stream;<br> Whether he first sees light<br> Where the river in gleaming rings<br> Sluggishly winds through the plain;<br> Whether in sound of the swallowing sea-; <br> As is the world on the banks,<br> So is the mind of the man.<br><br> Vainly does each, as he glides,<br> Fable and dream<br> Of the lands which the river of Time<br> Had left ere he woke on its breast,<br> Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed.<br> Only the tract where he sails<br> He wots of; only the thoughts,<br> Raised by the objects he passes, are his.<br><br> Who can see the green earth any more<br> As she was by the sources of Time?<br> Who imagines her fields as they lay<br> In the sunshine, unworn by the plough?<br> Who thinks as they thought,<br> The tribes who then roamed on her breast,<br> Her vigorous, primitive sons?<br><br> What girl<br> Now reads in her bosom as clear<br> As Rebekah read, when she sate<br> At eve by the palm-shaded well?<br> Who guards in her breast<br> As deep, as pellucid a spring<br> Of feeling, as tranquil, as sure?<br><br> What bard,<br> At the height of his vision, can deem<br> Of God, of the world, of the soul,<br> With a plainness as near,<br> As flashing as Moses felt<br> When he lay in the night by his flock<br> On the starlit Arabian waste?<br> Can rise and obey<br> The beck of the Spirit like him?<br><br> This tract which the river of Time<br> Now flows through with us, is the plain.<br> Gone is the calm of its earlier shore.<br> Bordered by cities and hoarse<br> With a thousand cries is its stream.<br> And we on its breast, our minds<br> Are confused as the cries which we hear,<br> Changing and shot as the sights which we see.<br><br> And we say that repose has fled<br> For ever the course of the river of Time.<br> That cities will crowd to its edge<br> In a blacker, incessanter line;<br> That the din will be more on its banks,<br> Denser the trade on its stream,<br> Flatter the plain where it flows,<br> Fiercer the sun overhead;<br> That never will those on its breast<br> See an ennobling sight,<br> Drink of the feeling of quiet again.<br><br> But what was before us we know not,<br> And we know not what shall succeed.<br><br> Haply, the river of Time-; <br> As it grows, as the towns on its marge<br> Fling their wavering lights<br> On a wider, statlier stream-; <br> May acquire, if not the calm<br> Of its early mountainous shore,<br> Yet a solemn peace of its own.<br><br> And the width of the waters, the hush<br> Of the grey expanse where he floats,<br> Freshening its current and spotted with foam<br> As it draws to the Ocean, amy strike<br> Peace to the soul of the man on its breast-; <br> As the pale waste widens around him,<br> As the banks fade dimmer away,<br> As the stars come out, and the night-wind<br> Brings up the stream<br> Murmurs and scents of the infinite sea."
