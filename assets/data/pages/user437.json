				"main_text": "It little profits that an idle king,<br> By this still hearth, among these barren crags,<br> Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole<br> Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br> That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.<br> <br> I cannot rest from travel: I will drink<br> Life to the lees: all times I have enjoyed<br> Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those<br> That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when<br> Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br> Vest the dim sea: I am become a name;<br> For always roaming with a hungry heart<br> Much have I seen and known; cities of men<br> And manners, climates, councils, governments,<br> Myself not least, but honoured of them all;<br> And drunk delight of battle with my peers;<br> Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.<br> I am part of all that I have met;<br> Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough<br> Gleams that untravelled world, whose margin fades<br> For ever and for ever when I move.<br> How dull it is to pause, to make an end,<br> To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!<br> As though to breath were life. Life piled on life<br> Were all to little, and of one to me<br> Little remains: but every hour is saved<br> From that eternal silence, something more,<br> A bringer of new things; and vile it were<br> For some three suns to store and hoard myself,<br> And this gray spirit yearning in desire<br> To follow knowledge like a sinking star,<br> Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.<br> <br> This is my son, mine own Telemachus,<br> To whom I leave the scepter and the isle&mdash;<br> Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill<br> This labour, by slow prudence to make mild<br> A rugged people, and through soft degrees<br> Subdue them to the useful and the good.<br> Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere<br> Of common duties, decent not to fail<br> In offices of tenderness, and pay<br> Meet adoration to my household gods,<br> When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.<br> <br> There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:<br> There gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners,<br> Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me&mdash;<br> That ever with a frolic welcome took<br> The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed<br> Free hearts, free foreheads&mdash;you and I are old;<br> Old age had yet his honour and his toil;<br> Death closes all: but something ere the end,<br> Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br> Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.<br> The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:<br> The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep<br> Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,<br> 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.<br> Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br> The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br> To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br> Of all the western stars, until I die.<br> It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br> It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br> And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br> Though much is taken, much abides; and though<br> We are not now that strength which in the old days<br> Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are,<br> One equal-temper of heroic hearts,<br> Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br> To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."
