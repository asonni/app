No, no? Then<br>How can we give you a thing?<br>Stop crying.<br>Open your hand.<br>Empty? Empty. Here is a hand<br><br>To fill it and willing<br>To bring teacups and roll away headaches<br>And do whatever you tell it.<br>Will you marry it?<br>It is guaranteed<br><br>To thumb shut your eyes at the end<br>And dissolve of sorrow.<br>We make new stock from the salt.<br>I notice you are stark naked<br>How about this suit -<br><br>Black and stiff, but not a bad fit.<br>Will you marry it?<br>It is waterproof, shatterproof, proof<br>Against fire and bombs through the roof.<br>Believe me, they'll bury you in it.<br><br>Now your head, excuse me, is empty.<br>I have the ticket for that.<br>Come here, sweetie, out of the closet.<br>Well, what do you think of that?<br>Naked as paper to start<br><br>But in twenty-five years she'll be silver,<br>In fifty, gold.<br>A living doll, everywhere you look.<br>It can sew, it can cook,<br>It can talk, talk, talk.<br><br>It works, there is nothing wrong with it.<br>You have a hole, it's a poultice.<br>You have an eye, it's an image.<br>My boy, it's your last resort.<br>Will you marry it, marry it, marry it."
