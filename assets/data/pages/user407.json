				"main_text": "The rain set early in tonight, <br> The sullen wind was soon awake, <br> It tore the elm-tops down for spite, <br> And did its worst to vex the lake: <br> I listened with heart fit to break. <br> When glided in Porphyria; straight <br> She shut the cold out and the storm, <br> And kneeled and made the cheerless grate <br> Blaze up, and all the cottage warm; <br> Which done, she rose, and from her form <br> Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl, <br> And laid her soiled gloves by, untied <br> Her hat and let the damp hair fall, <br> And, last, she sat down by my side <br> And called me. When no voice replied, <br> She put my arm about her waist, <br> And made her smooth white shoulder bare, <br> And all her yellow hair displaced, <br> And, stooping, made my cheek lie there, <br> And spread, o'er all, her yellow hair, <br> Murmuring how she loved me--she <br> Too weak, for all her heart's endeavor, <br> To set its struggling passion free <br> From pride, and vainer ties dissever, <br> And give herself to me forever. <br> But passion sometimes would prevail, <br> Nor could tonight's gay feast restrain <br> A sudden thought of one so pale <br> For love of her, and all in vain: <br> So, she was come through wind and rain. <br> Be sure I looked up at her eyes <br> Happy and proud; at last I knew <br> Porphyria worshiped me: surprise <br> Made my heart swell, and still it grew <br> While I debated what to do. <br> That moment she was mine, mine, fair, <br> Perfectly pure and good: I found <br> A thing to do, and all her hair <br> In one long yellow string I wound <br> Three times her little throat around, <br> And strangled her. No pain felt she; <br> I am quite sure she felt no pain. <br> As a shut bud that holds a bee, <br> I warily oped her lids: again <br> Laughed the blue eyes without a stain. <br> And I untightened next the tress <br> About her neck; her cheek once more <br> Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss: <br> I propped her head up as before <br> Only, this time my shoulder bore <br> Her head, which droops upon it still: <br> The smiling rosy little head, <br> So glad it has its utmost will, <br> That all it scorned at once is fled, <br> And I, its love, am gained instead! <br> Porphyria's love: she guessed not how <br> Her darling one wish would be heard. <br> And thus we sit together now, <br> And all night long we have not stirred, <br> And yet God has not said a word!"
