{"id":"user86","title":"Thomas Hardy","exclude_from_menu":"true","image":"Murat Tasiroglu.jpg","main_text":"Among the few features of agricultural England, which retain an appearance but little modified by the lapse of centuries, may be reckoned the long, grassy and furzy downs, coombs, or ewe-leases, as they are called according to their kind, that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and south-west. If any mark of human occupation is met with hereon, it usually takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd. <br> Fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down, and may possibly be standing there now. In spite of its loneliness, however, the spot, by actual measurement, was not three miles from a country-town. Yet that affected it little. Three miles of irregular upland, during the long inimical seasons, with their sleets, snows, rains, and mists, afford withdrawing space enough to isolate a Timon or a Nebuchadnezzar; much less, in fair weather, to please that less repellent tribe, the poets, philosophers, artists, and others who ‘conceive and meditate of pleasant things.’ <br> Some old earthen camp or barrow, some clump of trees, at least some starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the erection of these forlorn dwellings. But, in the present case, such a kind of shelter had been disregarded. Higher Crowstairs, as the house was called, stood quite detached and undefended. The only reason for its precise situation seemed to be the crossing of two footpaths at right angles hard by, which may have crossed there and thus for a good five hundred years. Hence the house was exposed to the elements on all sides. But, though the wind up here blew unmistakably when it did blow, and the rain hit hard whenever it fell, the various weathers of the winter season were not quite so formidable on the down as they were imagined to be by dwellers on low ground. The raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the hollows, and the frosts were scarcely so severe. When the shepherd and his family who tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from the exposure, they said that upon the whole they were less in convenienced by 'wuzzes and flames' (hoarses and phlegms) than when they had lived by the stream of a snug neighbouring valley. <br> The night of March 28, 182—, was precisely one of the nights that were wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration. The level rainstorm smote walls, slopes, and hedges like the clothyard shafts of Senlac and Crecy. Such sheep and outdoor animals as had no shelter stood with their buttocks to the winds; while the tails of little birds trying to roost on some scraggy thorn were blown inside-out like umbrellas. The gable-end of the cottage was stained with wet, and the eaves droppings flapped against the wall. Yet never was commiseration for the shepherd more misplaced. For that cheerful rustic was entertaining a large party in glorification of the christening of his second girl. <br> The guests had arrived before the rain began to fall, and they were all now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling. A glance into the apartment at eight o'clock on this eventful evening would have resulted in the opinion that it was as cosy and comfortable a nook as could be wished for in boisterous weather. The calling of its inhabitant was proclaimed by a number of highly-polished sheep-crooks without stems that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace, the curl of each shining crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the patriarchal pictures of old family Bibles to the most approved fashion of the last local sheep-fair. The room was lighted by half-a-dozen candles, having wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped them, in candlesticks that were never used but at high-days, holy-days, and family feasts. The lights were scattered about the room, two of them standing on the chimney-piece. This position of candles was in itself significant. Candles on the chimney-piece always meant a party. <br> On the hearth, in front of a back-brand to give substance, blazed a fire of thorns, that crackled ‘like the laughter of the fool.’ <br> Nineteen persons were gathered here. Of these, five women, wearing gowns of various bright hues, sat in chairs along the wall; girls shy and not shy filled the window bench; four men, including Charley Jake the hedge-carpenter, Elijah New the parish-clerk, and John Pitcher, a neighbouring dairyman, the shepherd's father-in-law, lolled in the settle; a young man and maid, who were blushing over tentative pourparlers on a life-companionship sat beneath the corner-cupboard; and an elderly engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where his betrothed was not to the spot where she was. Enjoyment was pretty general, and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by conventional restrictions. Absolute confidence in each other's good opinion begat perfect ease, while the finishing stroke of manner, amounting to a truly princely serenity, was lent to the majority by the absence of any expression or trait denoting that they wished to get on in the world, enlarge their minds, or do any eclipsing thing whatever—which nowadays so generally nips the bloom and bonhomie of all except the two extremes of the social scale. <br> Shepherd Fennel had married well, his wife being a dairyman's daughter from a vale at a distance, who brought fifty guineas in her pocket—and kept them there, till they should be required for ministering to the needs of a coming family. This frugal woman had been somewhat exercised as to the character that should be given to the gathering. A sit still party had its advantages; but an undisturbed position of ease in chairs and settles was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable deal of toping that they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry. A dancing-party was the alternative; but this, while avoiding the foregoing objection on the score of good drink, had a counterbalancing disadvantage in the matter of good victuals, the ravenous appetites engendered by the exercise causing immense havoc in the buttery. Shepherdess Fennel fell back upon the intermediate plan of mingling short dances with short periods of talk and singing, so as to hinder any ungovernable rage in either. But this scheme was entirely confined to her own gentle mind: the shepherd himself was in the mood to exhibit the most reckless phases of hospitality. <br> The fiddler was a boy of those parts, about twelve years of age, who had a wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels, though his fingers were so small and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the high notes, from which he scrambled back to the first position with sounds not of unmixed purity of tone. At seven the shrill tweedle-dee of this youngster had begun, accompanied by a booming ground-bass from Elijah New, the parish-clerk, who had thoughtfully brought with him his favourite musical instrument, the serpent. Dancing was instantaneous, Mrs. Fennel privately enjoining the players on no account to let the dance exceed the length of a quarter of an hour. <br> But Elijah and the boy in the excitement of their position quite forgot the injunction. Moreover, Oliver Giles, a man of seventeen, one of the dancers, who was enamoured of his partner, a fair girl of thirty-three rolling years, had recklessly handed a new crown-piece to the musicians, as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle and wind. Mrs. Fennel seeing the steam begin to generate on the countenances of her guests, crossed over and touched the fiddler's elbow and put her hand on the serpent's mouth. But they took no notice, and fearing she might lose her character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly, she retired and sat down helpless. And so the dance whizzed on with cumulative fury, the performers moving in their planet-like courses, direct and retrograde, from apogee to perigee, till the hand of the well-kicked clock at the bottom of the room had travelled over the circumference of an hour. <br> While these cheerful events were in course of enactment within Fennel's pastoral dwelling an incident having considerable bearing on the party had occurred in the gloomy night without. Mrs. Fennel's concern about the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point of time with the ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of Higher Crowstairs from the direction of the distant town. This personage strode on through the rain without a pause, following the little-worn path which, further on in its course, skirted the shepherd's cottage. <br> It was nearly the time of full moon, and on this account, though the sky was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud, ordinary objects out of doors were readily visible. The sad wan light revealed the lonely pedestrian to be a man of supple frame; his gait suggested that he had somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility, though not so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion required. At a rough guess, he might have been about forty years of age. He appeared tall, but a recruiting sergeant, or other person accustomed to the judging of men's heights by the eye, would have discerned that this was chiefly owing to his gauntness, and that he was not more than five-feet-eight or -nine. <br> Notwithstanding the regularity of his tread there was caution in it, as in that of one who mentally feels his way; and despite the fact that it was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he wore, there was something about him which suggested that he naturally belonged to the black-coated tribes of men. His clothes were of fustian, and his boots hobnailed, yet in his progress he showed not the mud-accustomed bearing of hobnailed and fustianed peasantry. <br> By the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherd's premises the rain came down, or rather came along, with yet more determined violence. The outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of wind and rain, and this induced him to stand still. The most salient of the shepherd's domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of his hedgeless garden, for in these latitudes the principle of masking the homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was unknown. The traveller's eye was attracted to this small building by the pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it. He turned aside, and, finding it empty, stood under the pent-roof for shelter. <br> While he stood the boom of the serpent within the adjacent house, and the lesser strains of the fiddler, reached the spot as an accompaniment to the surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod, its louder beating on the cabbage-leaves of the garden, on the straw hackles of eight or ten beehives just discernible by the path, and its dripping from the eaves into a row of buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage. For at Higher Crowstairs, as at all such elevated domiciles, the grand difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water; and a casual rainfall was utilized by turning out, as catchers, every utensil that the house contained. Some queer stories might be told of the contrivances for economy in suds and dishwaters that are absolutely necessitated in upland habitations during the droughts of summer. But at this season there were no such exigencies; a mere acceptance of what the skies bestowed was sufficient for an abundant store. <br> At last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent. This cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the reverie into which he had lapsed, and, emerging from the shed, with an apparently new intention, he walked up the path to the house-door. Arrived here, his first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside the row of vessels, and to drink a copious draught from one of them. Having quenched his thirst he rose and lifted his hand to knock, but paused with his eye upon the panel. Since the dark surface of the wood revealed absolutely nothing, it was evident that he must be mentally looking through the door, as if he wished to measure thereby all the possibilities that a house of this sort might include, and how they might bear upon the question of his entry. <br> In his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around. Not a soul was anywhere visible. The garden-path stretched downward from his feet, gleaming like the track of a snail; the roof of the little well (mostly dry), the well-cover, the top rail of the garden-gate, were varnished with the same dull liquid glaze; while, far away in the vale, a faint whiteness of more than usual extent showed that the rivers were high in the meads. Beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights through the beating drops-lights that denoted the situation of the county-town from which he had appeared to come. The absence of all notes of life in that direction seemed to clinch his intentions, and he knocked at the door. <br> Within, a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical sound. The hedge-carpenter was suggesting a song to the company, which nobody just then was inclined to undertake, so that the knock afforded a not unwelcome diversion. <br> ‘Walk in!’ said the shepherd promptly. <br> The latch clicked upward, and out of the night our pedestrian appeared upon the door-mat. The shepherd arose, snuffed two of the nearest candles, and turned to look at him. <br> Their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and not unprepossessing as to feature. His hat, which for a moment he did not remove, hung low over his eyes, without concealing that they were large, open, and determined, moving with a flash rather than a glance round the room. He seemed pleased with his survey, and, baring his shaggy head, said, in a rich deep voice, ‘The rain is so heavy, friends, that I ask leave to come in and rest awhile.’ <br> ‘To be sure, stranger,’ said the shepherd. ‘And faith, you've been lucky in choosing your time, for we are having a bit of a fling for a glad cause—though, to be sure, a man could hardly wish that glad cause to happen more than once a year.’ <br> ‘Nor less,’ spoke up a woman. ‘For 'tis best to get your family over and done with, as soon as you can, so as to be all the earlier out of the fag o't.’ <br> ‘And what may be this glad cause?’ asked the stranger. <br> ‘A birth and christening,’ said the shepherd.<br> The stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too many or too few of such episodes, and being invited by a gesture to a pull at the mug, he readily acquiesced. His manner, which, before entering, had been so dubious, was now altogether that of a careless and candid man. <br> ‘Late to be traipsing athwart this coomb—hey?’ said the engaged man of fifty. <br> ‘Late it is, master, as you say. I'll take a seat in the chimney-corner, if you have nothing to urge against it, ma'am; for I am a little moist on the side that was next the rain.’ <br> Mrs. Shepherd Fennel assented, and made room for the self-invited comer, who, having got completely inside the chimney-corner, stretched out his legs and his arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at home. <br> ‘Yes, I am rather cracked in the vamp,’ he said freely, seeing that the eyes of the shepherd's wife fell upon his boots, ‘and I am not well fitted either. I have had some rough times lately, and have been forced to pick up what I can get in the way of wearing, but I must find a suit better fit for working-days when I reach home.’<br> ‘One of hereabouts?’ she inquired. <br> ‘Not quite that—further up the country.’ <br> ‘I thought so. And so be I; and by your tongue you come from my neighbourhood.’ <br> ‘But you would hardly have heard of me,’ he said quickly. ‘My time would be long before yours, ma'am, you see.’ <br> This testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect of stopping her cross-examination. <br> ‘There is only one thing more wanted to make me happy,’ continued the new-comer. ‘And that is a little baccy, which I am sorry to say I am out of.’<br> ‘I'll fill your pipe,’ said the shepherd.<br> ‘I must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise.’<br> ‘A smoker, and no pipe about 'ee?’<br> ‘I have dropped it somewhere on the road.’ <br> The shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe, saying, as he did so, ‘Hand me your baccy-box—I'll fill that too, now I am about it.’ <br> The man went through the movement of searching his pockets. <br> ‘Lost that too?’ said his entertainer, with some surprise. <br> ‘I am afraid so,’ said the man with some confusion. ‘Give it to me in a screw of paper.’ Lighting his pipe at the candle with a suction that drew the whole flame into the bowl, he resettled himself in the corner and bent his looks upon the faint steam from his damp legs, as if he wished to say no more. <br> Meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice of this visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were engaged with the band about a tune for the next dance. The matter being settled, they were about to stand up when an interruption came in the shape of another knock at the door. <br> At sound of the same the man in the chimney-corner took up the poker and began stirring the brands as if doing it thoroughly were the one aim of his existence; and a second time the shepherd said, ‘Walk in!’ In a moment another man stood upon the straw-woven door-mat. He too was a stranger. <br> This individual was one of a type radically different from the first. There was more of the commonplace in his manner, and a certain jovial cosmopolitanism sat upon his features. He was several years older than the first arrival, his hair being slightly frosted, his eyebrows bristly, and his whiskers cut back from his checks. His face was rather full and flabby, and yet it was not altogether a face without power. A few grog-blossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose. He flung back his long drab greatcoat, revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cinder-grey shade throughout, large heavy seals, of some metal or other that would take a polish, dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament. Shaking the water-drops from his low-crowned glazed hat, he said, ‘I must ask for a few minutes' shelter, comrades, or I shall be wetted to my skin before I get to Casterbridge.’ <br> ‘Make yourself at home, master,’ said the shepherd, perhaps a trifle less heartily than on the first occasion. Not that Fennel had the least tinge of niggardliness in his composition; but the room was far from large, spare chairs were not numerous, and damp companions were not altogether desirable at close quarters for the women and girls in their bright-coloured gowns. <br> However, the second comer, after taking off his greatcoat, and hanging his hat on a nail in one of the ceiling-beams as if he had been specially invited to put it there, advanced and sat down at the table. This had been pushed so closely into the chimney-corner, to give all available room to the dancers, that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man who had ensconced himself by the fire; and thus the two strangers were brought into close companionship. They nodded to each other by way of breaking the ice of unacquaintance, and the first stranger handed his neighbour the family mug—a huge vessel of brownware, having its upper edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole generations of thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh, and bearing the following inscription burnt upon its rotund side in yellow letters:—<br> THERE iS NO FUN <br> UNTiLL i CUM.<br> The other man, nothing loth, raised the mug to his lips, and drank on, and on, and on—till a curious blueness overspread the countenance of the shepherd's wife, who had regarded with no little surprise the first stranger's free offer to the second of what did not belong to him to dispense. <br> ‘I knew it!’ said the toper to the shepherd with much satisfaction. ‘When I walked up your garden before coming in, and saw the hives all of a row, I said to myself, 'Where there's bees there's honey, and where there's honey there's mead.' But mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this I really didn't expect to meet in my older days.’ He took yet another pull at the mug, till it assumed anominous elevation. <br> ‘Glad you enjoy it!’ said the shepherd warmly. <br> ‘It is goodish mead,’ assented Mrs. Fennel, with an absence of enthusiasm which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise for one's cellar at too heavy a price. ‘It is trouble enough to make—and really I hardly think we shall make any more. For honey sells well, and we ourselves can make shift with a drop o' small mead and metheglin for common use from the comb-washings.’ <br> ‘O, but you'll never have the heart!’ reproachfully cried the stranger in cinder-grey, after taking up the mug a third time and setting it down empty.’ I love mead, when 'tis old like this, as I love to go to church o' Sundays, or to relieve the needy any day of the week.’ <br> ‘Ha, ha, ha!’ said the man in the chimney-corner, who, in spite of the taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco, could not or would not refrain from this slight testimony to his comrade's humour. <br> Now the old mead of those days, brewed of the purest first-year or maiden honey, four pounds to the gallon—with its due complement of white of eggs, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, rosemary, yeast, and processes of working, bottling, and cellaring—tasted remarkably strong; but it did not taste so strong as it actually was. Hence, presently, the stranger in cinder-grey at the table, moved by its creeping influence, unbuttoned his waistcoat, threw himself back in his chair, spread his legs, and made his presence felt in various ways. <br> ‘Well, well, as I say,’ he resumed, ‘I am going to Casterbridge, and to Casterbridge I must go, I should have been almost there by this time; but therain drove me into your dwelling, and I'm not sorry for it.’ <br> ‘You don't live in Casterbridge?’ said the shepherd. <br> ‘Not as yet; though I shortly mean to move there.’ <br> ‘Going to set up in trade, perhaps?’ <br> ‘No, no,’ said the shepherd's wife. ‘It is easy to see that the gentleman is rich, and don't want to work at anything.’ <br> The cinder-grey stranger paused, as if to consider whether he would accept that definition of himself. He presently rejected it by answering, ‘Rich is not quite the word for me, dame. I do work, and I must work. And even if I only get to Casterbridge by midnight I must begin work there at eight to-morrow morning. Yes, het or wet, blow or snow, famine or sword, my day's work to-morrow must be done.’ <br> ‘Poor man! Then, in spite o' seeming, you be worse off than we?’ replied the shepherd's wife. <br> ‘ 'Tis the nature of my trade, men and maidens. 'Tis the nature of my trade more than my poverty. . . . But really and truly I must up and off, or I shan't get a lodging in the town.’ However, the speaker did not move, and directly added, ‘There's time for one more draught of friendship before I go; and I'd perform it at once if the mug were not dry.’ <br> ‘Here's a mug o' small,’ said Mrs. Fennel. ‘Small, we call it, though to be sure 'tis only the first wash o' the combs.’ <br> ‘No,’ said the stranger disdainfully. ‘I won't spoil your first kindness by partaking o' your second. ‘ <br> ‘Certainly not,’ broke in Fennel. ‘We don't increase and multiply everyday, and I'll fill the mug again.’ He went away to the dark place under the stairs where the barrel stood. The shepherdess followed him. <br> ‘Why should you do this?’ she said reproachfully, as soon as they were alone. ‘He's emptied it once, though it held enough for ten people; and now he's not contented wi' the small, but must needs call for more o' the strong! And a stranger unbeknown to any of us. For my part, I don't like the look o' the man at all.’ <br> ‘But he's in the house, my honey; and ‘tis a wet night, and a christening. Daze it, what's a cup of mead more or less? There'll be plenty more next bee-burning. ‘ <br> ‘Very well—this time, then,’ she answered, looking wistfully at the barrel. ‘But what is the man's calling, and where is he one of, that he should come in and join us like this?’ <br> ‘I don't know. I'll ask him again.’ <br> The catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the stranger in cinder-grey was effectually guarded against this time by Mrs. Fennel. She poured out his allowance in a small cup, keeping the large one at a discreet distance from him. When he had tossed off his portion the shepherd renewed his inquiry about, the stranger's occupation. <br> The latter did not immediately reply, and the man in the chimney-corner, with sudden demonstrativeness, said, ‘Anybody may know my trade—I'm a wheelwright.’ <br> ‘A very good trade for these parts,’ said the shepherd. <br> ‘And anybody may know mine—if they've the sense to find it out,’ said the stranger in cinder-grey. <br> ‘You may generally tell what a man is by his claws,’ observed the hedge-carpenter, looking at his own hands, ‘My fingers be as full of thorns as an old pin-cushion is of pins.’ <br> The hands of the man in the chimney-corner instinctively sought the shade, and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe. The man at the table took up the hedge-carpenter's remark, and added smartly, ‘True; but the oddity of my trade is that, instead of setting a mark upon me, it sets mark upon my customers.’ <br> No observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma the shepherd's wife once more called for song. The same obstacles presented themselves as at the former time—one had no voice, another had forgotten the first verse. The stranger at the table, whose soul had now risen to a good working temperature, relieved the difficulty by exclaiming that, to start the company, he would sing himself. Thrusting one thumb into the arm-hole of his waistcoat, he waved the other hand in the air, and, with an extemporizing gaze at the shining sheep-crooks above the mantelpiece, began:—<br> ‘Oh, my trade it is the rarest one, <br> Simple shepherds all—<br> My trade is a sight to see; <br> For my customers I tie, and take them up on high <br> And waft 'em to a far countree!’<br> The room was silent when he had finished the verse with one exception, that of the man in the chimney-corner who, at the singer's word, ‘Chorus!’ joined him in a deep bass voice of musical relish—<br> ‘And waft 'em to a far countree!<br> Oliver Giles, John Pitcher the dairyman, the parish-clerk the engaged man of fifty, the row of young women again the wall, seemed lost in thought not of the gayest kind. The shepherd looked meditatively on the ground, the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer, and with some suspicion she was doubting whether this stranger were merely singing an old song from recollection, or was composing one there and then for the occasion. All were as perplexed at the obscure revelation as the guests at Belshazzar's Feast, except the man in the chimney-corner, who quietly said, ‘Second verse, stranger,’ and smoked on. <br> The singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inwards, and went onwith the next stanza as requested:—<br> ‘My tools are but common ones, <br> Simple shepherds all—<br> My tools are no sight to see;<br> A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing, <br> Are implements enough for me!’<br> Shepherd Fennel glanced round. There was no longer any doubt that the stranger was answering his question rhythmically. The guests one and all started back with suppressed exclamations. The young woman engaged to the man of fifty fainted half-way, and would have proceeded, but finding—him wanting in alacrity for catching her she sat down trembling. <br> ‘O, he's the—!’ whispered the people in the background, mentioning the name of an ominous public officer. ‘He's come to do it! 'Tis to be at Casterbridge jail to-morrow—the man for sheep-stealing—the poor clockmaker we heard of, who used to live away at Shottsford and had no work to do—Timothy Summers, whose family were a-starving, and so he went out of Shottsford by the high-road, and took a sheep in open daylight, defying the farmer and the farmer's wife and the farmer's lad, and every man jack among 'em. He’ (and they nodded towards the stranger of the deadly trade) ‘is come from up the country to do it because there's not enough to do in his own county-town, and he's got the place here now our own county man's dead; he's going to live in the same cottage under the prison wall.’ <br> The stranger in cinder-grey took no notice of this whispered string of observations, but again wetted his lips. Seeing that his friend in the chimney-corner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality in any way, he held out his cup towards that appreciative comrade, who also held out his own. They clinked together, the eyes of the rest of the room hanging upon the singer’s actions. He parted his lips for the third verse; but at that moment another knock was audible upon the door. This time the knock was faint and hesitating. The company seemed scared; the shepherd looked with consternation towards the entrance, and it was with some effort that he resisted his alarmed wife's deprecatory glance, and uttered for the third time the welcoming words, ‘Walk in!’ <br> The door was gently opened, and another man stood upon the mat. He, like those who had preceded him, was a stranger. This time it was a short, small personage, of fair complexion, and dressed in a decent suit of dark clothes. <br> ‘Can you tell me the way to—?’ he began: when, gazing round the room to observe the nature of the company amongst whom he had fallen, his eyes lighted on the stranger in the cinder-grey. It was just at the instant when the latter, who had thrown his mind into his song with such a will that he scarcely heeded the interruption, silenced all whispers and inquiries by bursting into his third verse:—<br> ‘To-morrow is my working day, <br> Simple shepherds all—<br> To-morrow is a working day for me: <br> For the farmer's sheep is slain, and the lad who did <br> it ta'en, <br> And on his soul may God ha' merc-y!’<br> The stranger in the chimney-corner, waving cups with the singer so heartily thathis mead splashed over on the hearth repeated in his bass voice as before:— <br> ‘And on his soul may God ha' merc-y!’<br> All this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway. Finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking, the guests particularly regarded him. The noticed to their surprise that he stood before them the picture of abject terror—his knees trembling, his hand shaking so violently that the door-latch by which he supported himself rattled audibly: his white lips were parted, and his eyes fixed on the merry officer of justice in the middle the room. A moment more and he had turned, closed the door, and fled. <br> ‘What a man can it be?’ said the shepherd.<br> The rest, between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd conduct of this third visitor, looked as if they knew not what to think, and said nothing. Instinctively they withdrew further and further from the grim gentleman in their midst, whom some of them seemed to take for the Prince of Darkness himself, till they formed a remote circle, an empty space of floor being left between them and him—<br> ‘. . . circulus, cujus centrum diabolus.’<br> The room was so silent—though there were more than twenty people in it—that nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the window-shutters, accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that fell down the chimney into the fire, and the steady puffing of the man in the corner, who had now resumed his pipe of long clay. <br> The stillness was unexpectedly broken. The distant sound of a gun reverberated through the air—apparently from the direction of the county-town. <br> ‘Be jiggered!’ cried the stranger who had sung the song, jumping up. <br> ‘What does that mean?’ asked several. <br> ‘A prisoner escaped from the jail—that's what it means.<br> All listened. The sound was repeated, and none of them spoke but the man in the chimney-corner, who said quietly, ‘I've often been told that in this county they fire a gun at such times; but I never heard it till now.’ <br> ‘I wonder if it is my man?’ murmured the personage in cinder-grey. <br> ‘Surely it is!’ said the shepherd involuntarily. ‘And surely we've zeed him! That little man who looked, in at the door by now, and quivered like a leaf when he zeed ye and heard your song!’ <br> ‘His teeth chattered, and the breath went out of his body,’ said the dairyman. <br> ‘And his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone,’ said Oliver Giles. <br> ‘And he bolted as if he'd been shot at,’ said the hedge carpenter. <br> ‘True—his teeth chattered, and his heart seemed to sing and he bolted as if he'd been shot at,’ slowly summed up the man in the chimney-corner. <br> ‘I didn't notice it,’ remarked the hangman. <br> ‘We were all a—wondering what made him run off in such a fright,’ faltered one of the women against the wall, ‘and now 'tis explained!’ <br> The firing of the alarm-gun went on at intervals, low and sullenly, and their suspicions became a certainty. The sinister gentleman in cinder-grey roused himself. ‘Is there a constable here?’ he asked, in thick tones. ‘If so, let him step forward.’ <br> The engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out from the wall, his betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair. <br> ‘You are a sworn constable?’ <br> ‘I be, sir.’ <br> ‘Then pursue the criminal at once, with assistance, and bring him back here. He can't have gone far.’ <br> ‘I will, sir, I will—when I've got my staff. I'll go home and get it, and come sharp here, and start in a body.’ <br> ‘Staff!—never mind your staff; the man'll be gone!’ <br> ‘But I can't do nothing without my staff—can I, William, and John, and Charles Jake? No; for there's the king's royal crown a painted on en in yaller and gold, and the lion and the unicorn, so as when I raise en up and hit my prisoner, 'tis made a lawful blow thereby. I wouldn't 'tempt to take up a man without my staff—no, not I. If I hadn't the law to gie me courage, why, instead o' my taking up him he might take up me!’ <br> ‘Now, I'm a king's man myself, and can give you authority enough for this,’ said the formidable officer in grey. ‘Now then, all of ye, be ready. Have ye any lanterns?' <br> ‘Yes—have ye any lanterns?—I demand it!’ said the constable. <br> ‘And the rest of you able-bodied—’ <br> ‘Able-bodied men—yes—the rest of ye!’ said the constable. <br> ‘Have you some good stout staves and pitchforks—’ <br> ‘Staves and pitchforks—in the name o' the law! And take 'em in yer hands and go in quest, and do as we in authority tell ye!’ <br> Thus aroused, the men prepared to give chase. The evidence was, indeed, though circumstantial, so convincing, that but little argument was needed to show the shepherd's guests that after what they had seen it would look very much like connivance if they did not instantly pursue the unhappy third stranger, who could not as yet have gone more than a few hundred yards over such uneven country. <br> A shepherd is always well provided with lanterns; and, lighting these hastily, and with hurdle-staves in their hands, they poured out of the door, taking a direction along the crest of the hill, away from the town, the rain having fortunately a little abated. <br> Disturbed by the noise, or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism, the child who had been christened began to cry heart-brokenly in the room overhead. These notes of grief came down through the chinks of the floor to the ears of the women below, who jumped up one by one, and seemed glad of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby, for the incidents of the last half-hour greatly oppressed them. Thus in the space of two or three minutes the room on the ground-floor was deserted quite. <br> But it was not for long. Hardly had the sound of footsteps died away when a man returned round the corner of the house from the direction the pursuers had taken. Peeping in at the door, and seeing nobody there, he entered leisurely. It was the stranger of the chimney-corner, who had gone out with the rest. The motive of his return was shown by his helping himself to a cut piece of skimmer cake that lay on a ledge beside where he had sat, and which he had apparently forgotten to take with him. He also poured out half a cup more mead from the quantity that remained, ravenously eating and drinking these as he stood. He had not finished when another figure came in just as quietly—his friend in cinder-grey. <br> ‘O—you here?’ said the latter, smiling. ‘I thought you had gone to help in the capture.’ And this speaker also revealed the object of his return by looking solicitously round for the fascinating mug of old mead. <br> ‘And I thought you had gone,’ said the other, continuing his skimmer-cake with some effort. <br> ‘Well, on second thoughts, I felt there were enough without me,’ said the first confidentially, ‘and such a night as it is, too. Besides, 'tis the business o' the Government to take care of its criminals—not mine.’ <br> ‘True; so it is. And I felt as you did, that there were enough without me.’ <br> ‘I don't want to break my limbs running over the humps and hollows of this wild country.’ <br> ‘Nor I neither, between you and me.’ <br> ‘These shepherd-people are used to it—simple-minded souls, you know, stirred up to anything in a moment. They'll have him ready for me before the morning, and no trouble to me at all.’ <br> ‘They'll have him, and we shall have saved ourselves all labour in the matter.’ <br> ‘True, true. Well, my way is to Casterbridge; and 'tis as much as my legs will do to take me that far. Going the same way?’ <br> ‘No, I am sorry to say! I have to get home over there’ (he nodded indefinitely to the right), ‘and I feel as you do, that it is quite enough for my legs to do before bedtime.’ <br> The other had by this time finished the mead in the mug, after which, shaking hands heartily at the door, and wishing each other well, they went their several ways. <br> In the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the hog's-back elevation which dominated this part of the down. They had decided on no particular plan of action; and, finding that the man of the baleful trade was no longer in their company, they seemed quite unable to form any such plan now. They descended in all directions down the hill, and straightway several of the party fell into the snare set by Nature for all misguided midnight ramblers over this part of the cretaceous formation. The ‘lanchets,’ or flintslopes, which belted the escarpment at intervals of a dozen yards, took the less cautious ones unawares, and losing their footing on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downwards, the lanterns rolling from their hands to the bottom, and there lying on their sides till the horn was scorched through. <br> When they had again gathered themselves together the shepherd, as the man who knew the country best, took the lead, and guided them round these treacherous inclines. The lanterns, which seemed rather to dazzle their eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration, were extinguished, due silence was observed; and in this more rational order they plunged into the vale. It was a grassy, briery, moist defile, affording some shelter to any person who had sought it; but the party perambulated it in vain, and ascended on the other side. Here they wandered apart, and after an interval closed together again to report progress. At the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely ash, the single tree on this part of the coomb, probably sown there by a passing bird some fifty years before. And here, standing a little to one side of the trunk, as motionless as the trunk itself, appeared the man they were in quest of, his outline being well defined against the sky beyond. The band noiselessly drew up and faced him. <br> ‘Your money or your life!’ said the constable sternly to the still figure. <br> ‘No, no,’ whispered John Pitcher. ‘ 'Tisn't our side ought to say that. That's the doctrine of vagabonds like him, and we be on the side of the law.’ <br> ‘Well, well,’ replied the constable impatiently; ‘I must say something, mustn't I? and if you had all the weight o' this undertaking upon your mind, perhaps you'd say the wrong thing too!—Prisoner at the bar, surrender, in the name of the Father—the Crown, I mane!’ <br> The man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time, and, giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage, he strolled slowly towards them. He was, indeed, the little man, the third stranger; but his trepidation had in a great measure gone. <br> ‘Well, travellers,' he said, 'did I hear ye speak to me?’ <br> ‘You did: you've got to come and be our prisoner at once!’ said the constable. ‘We arrest 'ee on the charge of not biding in Casterbridge jail in a decent proper manner to be hung to-morrow morning. Neighbours, do your duty, and seize the culpet!’ <br> On hearing the charge the man seemed enlightened, and, saying not another word, resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search-party, who, with their staves in their hands, surrounded him on all sides, and marched him back towards the shepherd's cottage. <br> It was eleven o'clock by the time they arrived. The light shining from the open door, a sound of men's voices within, proclaimed to them as they approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence. <br> On entering they discovered the shepherd's living room to be invaded by two officers from Casterbridge jail, and a well-known magistrate who lived at the nearest country-seat, intelligence of the escape having become generally circulated. <br> ‘Gentlemen,’ said the constable, ‘I have brought back your man—not without risk and danger; but every one must do his duty! He is inside this circle of able-bodied persons, who have lent me useful aid, considering their ignorance of Crown work. Men, bring forward your prisoner!’ And the third stranger was let to the light. <br> ‘Who is this?’ said one of the officials. <br> ‘The man,’ said the constable. <br> ‘Certainly not,’ said the turnkey; and the first corroborated his statement. <br> ‘But how can it be otherwise?’ asked the constable. ‘Or why was he so terrified at sight o' the singing instrument of the law who sat there?’ Here he related the strange behaviour of the third stranger on entering the house during the hangman's song. <br> ‘Can't understand it,’ said the officer coolly. <br> ‘All I know is that it is not the condemned man. He's quite a different character from this one; a gauntish fellow, with dark hair and eyes, rather good-looking, and with a musical bass voice that if you heard it once you'd never mistake as long as you lived.’ <br> ‘Why, souls—'twas the man in the chimney-corner!’ <br> ‘Hey—what?’ said the magistrate, coming forward after inquiring particulars from the shepherd in the background. ‘Haven't you got the man after all?’ <br> ‘Well, sir,’ said the constable, ‘he's the man we were in search of, that's true; and yet he's not the man we were in search of. For the man we were in search of was not the man we wanted, sir, if you understand my every-day way; for 'twas the man in the chimney-corner!’ <br> ‘A pretty kettle of fish altogether!’ said the magistrate. <br> ‘You had better start for the other man at once.’ <br> The prisoner now spoke for the first time. The mention of the man in the chimney-corner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do. ‘Sir,’ he said, stepping forward to the magistrate, ‘take no more trouble about me. The time is come when I may as well speak. I have done nothing; my crime is that the condemned man is my brother. Early this afternoon I left home at Shottsford to tramp it all the way to Casterbridge jail to bid him farewell. I was benighted, and called here to rest and ask the way. When I opened the door I saw before me the very man, my brother, that I thought to see in the condemned cell at Casterbridge. He was in this chimney corner; and jammed close to him, so that he could not have got out if he had tried, was the executioner who'd come to take his life, singing a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close by, joining in to save appearances. My brother threw a glance of agony at me, and I knew he meant, 'Don't reveal what you see; my life depends on it.' I was so terror-struck that I could hardly stand, and, not knowing what I did, I turned and hurried away.’ <br> The narrator's manner and tone had the stamp of truth and his story made a great impression on all around. ‘And do you know where your brother is at the present time?’ asked the magistrate. <br> ‘I do not. I have never seen him since I closed this door.’ <br> ‘I can testify to that, for we've been between ye ever since,’ said the constable. <br> ‘Where does he think to fly to?—what is his occupation?’ <br> ‘He's a watch-and-clock-maker, sir.’ <br> ‘ 'A said 'a was a wheelwright—a wicked rouge,’ said the constable. <br> ‘The wheels of clocks and watches he meant, no doubt,’ said Shepherd Fennel. <br> ‘I thought his hands were palish for's trade.’ <br> ‘Well, it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor man in custody,’ said the magistrate: your business lies with the other, unquestionably.’ <br> And so the little man was released off-hand; but he looked nothing the less sad on that account, it being beyond the power of magistrate or constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain, for they concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself. When this was done, and the man had gone his way, the night was found to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before the next morning. <br> Next day, accordingly, the quest for the clever sheep-stealer became general and keen, to all appearance at least. But the intended punishment was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression, and the sympathy of a great many country-folk in that district was strongly on the side of the fugitive. Moreover, his marvellous coolness and daring in hob-and-nobbing with the hangman, under the unprecedented circumstances of the shepherd's party, won their admiration. So that it may be questioned if all those who ostensibly made themselves so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough when it came to the private examination of their own lofts and outhouses. Stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in some old overgrown trackway or other, remote from turnpike roads; but when a search was instituted in any of these suspected quarters nobody was found. Thus the days and weeks passed without tidings. <br> In brief, the bass-voiced man of the chimney-corner was never recaptured. Some said that he went across the sea, others that he did not, but buried himself in the depths of a populous city. At any rate, the gentleman in cinder-grey never did his morning's work at Casterbridge, nor met any where at all, for business purposes, the genial comrade with whom he had passed an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the slope of the coomb. <br> The grass has long been green on the graves of Shepherd Fennel and his frugal wife; the guests who made up the christening party have mainly followed their entertainers to the tomb; the baby in whose honour they all had met is a matron in the sere and yellow leaf. But the arrival of the three strangers at the shepherd's that night, and the details connected therewith, is a story as well known as ever in the country about Higher Crowstairs.</p><br>‘Talking of Exhibitions, World's Fairs, and what not,’ said the old gentleman, ‘I would not go round the corner to see a dozen of them nowadays. The only exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any impression upon my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of them all, and now a thing of old times—the Great Exhibition of 1851, in Hyde Park, London. None of the younger generation can realize the sense of novelty it produced in us who were then in our prime. A noun substantive went so far as to become an adjective in honor of the occasion. It was ‘exhibition’ hat, ‘exhibition’ razor-strop, ‘exhibition’ watch; nay, even ‘exhibition’ weather, ‘exhibition’ spirits, sweethearts, babies, wives—for the time. <br> <br> ‘For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary chronological frontier or transit line, at which there occurred what one might call a precipice in time. As in a geological ‘fault,’ we had presented to us a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute contact, such as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was ever witnessed in this part of the country.’ <br> <br> These observations led us onward to talk of the different personages, gentle and simple, who lived and moved within our narrow and peaceful horizon at that time; and of three people in particular, whose queer little history was oddly touched at points by the Exhibition, more concerned with it than that of anybody else who dwelt in those outlying shades of the world, Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon. First prominence among these three came Wat Ollamoor—if that were his real name—whom the seniors in our party had known well. <br> <br> He was a woman's man, they said,—supremely so—externally little else. To men he was not attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times. Musician, dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in theory, he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew where; though some said his first appearance in this neighborhood had been as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill Fair. Many a worthy villager envied him his power over unsophisticated maidenhood power which seemed sometimes to have a touch of the weird and wizardly in it. Personally he was not ill-favored, though rather un-English, his complexion being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather clammy—made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when he came fresh to a party, caused him to smell like ‘boys'-love’(southern-wood) steeped in lamp-oil. On occasion he wore curls—a double row—running almost horizontally around his head. But as these were sometimes noticeably absent, it was concluded that they were not altogether of Nature's making. By girls whose love for him had turned to hatred he had been nicknamed ‘Mop,’ from this abundance of hair, which was long enough to rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more and more prevailed. <br> <br> His fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination he exercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a most peculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving preacher. There were tones in it which bred the immediate conviction that indolence and averseness to systematic application were all that lay between ‘Mop’ and the career of a second Paganini. <br> <br> While playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes, and, as it were, allowing the violin to wander on at will into the most plaintive passages ever heard by rustic man. There was a certain lingual character in the supplicatory expressions he produced, which would well-nigh have drawn an ache from the heart of a gatepost. He could make any child in the parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a few minutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he almost entirely affected—country jigs, reels, and ‘Favorite Quick Steps’ of the last century—some mutilated remains of which even now reappear as nameless phantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they are recognized only by the curious, or by such old-fashioned and far—between people as have been thrown with men like Wat Ollamoor in their early life. <br> <br> His date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock quire-band which comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest—in fact, he did not rise above the horizon thereabout till those well-known musicians were disbanded as ecclesiastical functionaries. In their honest love of thoroughness they despised the new man's style. Theophilus Dewy (Reuben the tranter's younger brother) used to say there was no ‘plumness’ in it—no bowing, no solidity—it was all fantastical. And probably this was true. Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a note of church-music from his birth; he never once sat in the gallery of Mellstock church where the others had tuned their venerable psalmody so many hundreds of times; had never, in all likelihood, entered a church at all. All were devil's tunes in his repertory. ‘He could no more play the Wold Hundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen serpent,’ the tranter would say. (The brazen serpent was supposed in Mellstock to be a musical instrument particularly hard to blow.) <br> <br> Occasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect upon the souls of grown-up persons, especially young women of fragile and responsive organization. Such an one was Car'line Aspent. Though she was already engaged to be married before she met him, Car'line, of them all, was the most influenced by Mop Ollamoor's heart-stealing melodies, to her discomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury. She was a pretty, invocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief defect as a companion with her sex was a tendency to peevishness now and then. At this time she was not a resident in Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off at Stickleford, further down the river. <br> <br> How and where she first made acquaintance with him and his fiddling is not truly known, but the story was that it either began or was developed on one spring evening, when, in passing through Lower Mellstock, she chanced to pause on the bridge near his house to rest herself, and languidly leaned over the parapet. Mop was standing on his door-step, as was his custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and demi-semiquavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit of passersby, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks of the little children hanging around him. Car'line pretended to be engrossed with the rippling of the stream under the arches, but in reality she was listening, as he knew. Presently the aching of the heart seized her simultaneously with a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an infinite dance. To shake off the fascination she resolved to goon, although it would be necessary to pass him as he played. On stealthily glancing ahead at the performer, she found to her relief that his eyes were closed in abandonment to instrumentation, and she strode on boldly. But when closer her step grew timid, her head convulsed itself more and more accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly danced along. Gaining another glance at him when immediately opposite, she saw that one of his eyes was open, quizzing her as he smiled at her emotional state. Her gait could not divest itself of its compelled capers till she had gone a long way past the house; and Car'line was unable to shake off the strange infatuation for hours. <br> <br> After that day, whenever there was to be in the neighborhood a dance to which she could get an invitation, and where Mop Ollamoor was to be the musician, Car'line contrived to be present, though it sometimes involved a walk of several miles; for he did not play so often in Stickleford as elsewhere. <br> <br> The next evidences of his influence over her were singular enough, and it would require a neurologist to fully explain them. She would be sitting quietly, any evening after dark, in the house of her father, the parish clerk, which stood in the middle of Stickleford village street, this being the highroad between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles eastward. Here, without a moment's warning, and in the midst of a general conversation between her father, sister, and the young man before alluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of her infatuation, she would start from her seat in the chimney corner as if she had received a galvanic shock, and spring convulsively toward the ceiling; then she would burst into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed that she grew calm as usual. Her father, knowing her hysterical tendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in his youngest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of epileptic fit. Not so her sister Julia. Julia had found out what was the cause. At the moment before the jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated in the chimney-nook could have caught down the flue the beat of a man's footstep along the highway without. But it was in that footfall, for which she had been waiting, that the origin of Car'line's involuntary springing lay. The pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew; but his business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman whom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two miles further on. On one, and only one, occasion did it happen that Car'line could not control her utterance; it was when her sister alone chanced to be present. ‘O—O—O—!’ she cried. ‘He's going to her, and not coming to me!’ <br> <br> To do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly of, or spoken much to, this girl of impressionable mold. But he had soon found out her secret, and could not resist a little by-play with her too easily hurt heart, as an interlude between his more serious love makings at Moreford. The two became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly a soul in Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft, being aware of the attachment. Her father disapproved of her coldness to Ned; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this nervous passion for a man of whom so little was known. The ultimate result was that Car'line's manly and simple wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically hopeless. He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than Mop the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put his flat and final question, would she marry him, then and there, now or never, it was with little expectation of obtaining more than the negative she gave him. Though her father supported him and her sister supported him, he could not play the fiddle so as to draw your soul out of your body like a spider's thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy wind and yearned for something to cling to. Indeed, Hipcroft had not the slightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune, much less play them. <br> <br> The No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a preliminary encouragement, gave Ned a new start in life. It had been uttered in such atone of sad entreaty that he resolved to persecute her no more; she should not even be distressed by a sight of his form in the distant perspective of the street and lane. He left the place, and his natural course was to London. <br> <br> The railway to South Wessex was in process of construction, but it was not as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached the capital by a six days' trudge on foot, as many a better man had done before him. He was one of the last of the artisan class who used that now extinct method of travel to the great centers of labor, so customary then from time immemorial. <br> <br> In London he lived and worked regularly at his trade. More fortunate than many, his disinterested willingness recommended him from the first. During the ensuing four years he was never out of employment. He neither advanced nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but he did not shift one jot in social position. About his love for Car'line he maintained a rigid silence. No doubt he often thought of her; but being always occupied, and having no relations at Stickleford, he held no communication with that part of the country, and showed no desire to return. In his quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-hours with the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to his stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long bachelorhood. For this conduct one is bound to advance the canonical reason that time could not efface from his heart the image of little Car'line Aspent—and it maybe in part true; but there was also the inference that his was a nature not greatly dependent upon the ministrations of the other sex for its comforts. <br> <br> The fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was the year of the Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at the construction of this huge glasshouse, then unexampled in the world's history, he worked daily. It was an era of great hope and activity among the nations and industries. Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the movement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity. Yet for him, too, the year was destined to have its surprises, for when the bustle of getting the building ready for the opening day was past, the ceremonies had been witnessed, and people were flocking thither from all parts of the globe, he received a letter from Car'line. Till that day the silence of four years between himself and Stickleford had never been broken. <br> <br> She informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship, which suggested a trembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in ascertaining his address, and then broached the subject which had prompted her to write. Four years ago, she said with the greatest delicacy of which she was capable, she had been so foolish as to refuse him. Her willful wrong headedness had since been a grief to her many times, and of late particularly. As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent almost as long as Ned—she did not know where. She would gladly marry Ned now if he were to ask her again, and be a tender little wife to him till her life's end. <br> <br> A tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned Hipcroft's frame on receipt of this news, if we may judge by the issue. Unquestionably he loved her still, even if not to the exclusion of every other happiness. This from his Car'line, she who had seen dead to him these many years, alive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant, gratifying thing. Ned had grown so resigned to, or satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he probably would not have shown much jubilation at anything. Still, a certain ardor of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how deeply her confession of faith in him had stirred him. Measured and methodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that day, nor the next, nor the next. He was having ‘a good ink.’ When he did answer it, there was a great deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the unmistakable tenderness of his reply; but the tenderness itself was sufficient to reveal that he was pleased with her straight forward frankness; that the anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was renewable, if it had not been continuously firm. <br> <br> He told her—and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously over the few gentle words of raillery he indited among the rest of his sentences—that it was all very well for her to come round at this time of day. Why wouldn't she have him when he wanted her? She had no doubt learned that he was not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on another? She ought to beg his pardon. Still, he was not the man to forget her. But considering how he had been used, and what he had suffered, she could not quite expect him to go down to Stickleford and fetch her. But if she would come to him, and say she was sorry, as was only fair; why, yes, he would marry her, knowing what a good little woman she was at the core. He added that the request for her to come to him was a less one to make than it would have been when he first left Stickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into South Wessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run wonderfully contrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on account of the Great Exhibition; so that she could come up easily alone. <br> <br> She said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so generously, after her hot and cold treatment of him; that though she felt frightened at the magnitude of the journey, and was never as yet in a railway-train, having only seen one pass at a distance, she embraced his offer with all her heart; and would, indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his pardon, and try to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.<br> <br> The remaining details of when and where were soon settled, Car'line informing him, for her ready identification in the crowd, that she would be wearing ‘my new sprigged-layback cotton gown,’ and Ned gaily responding that, having married her the morning after her arrival, he would make a day of it by taking her to the Exhibition. One early summer afternoon, accordingly, he came from his place of work, and fastened toward Waterloo Station to meet her. It was as wet and chilly as an English June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the platform in the drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have something to live for again. <br> <br> The ‘excursion-train’—an absolutely new departure in the history of travel—was still a novelty on the Wessex line, and probably everywhere. Crowds of people had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness the unwonted sight of so long a train's passage, even where they did not take advantage of the opportunity it offered. The seats for the humbler class of travelers in these early experiments in steam-locomotion, were open trucks, without any protection whatever from the wind and rain; and damp weather having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants of these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London terminus, found to be in a pitiable condition from their long journey; blue-faced, stiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled to the marrow, many of the men being hatless; in fact, they resembled people who had been out all night in an open boat on a rough sea, rather than inland excursionists for pleasure. The women had in some degree protected themselves by turning up the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this arrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they were all more or less in a sorry plight. <br> <br> In the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which followed the entry of the huge concatenation into the station, Ned Hipcroft soon discerned the slim little figure his eye was in search of, in the sprigged lilac, as described. She came up to him with a frightened smile—still pretty, though so damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from long exposure to the wind. <br> <br> ‘O, Ned! ‘ she sputtered, ‘I—I—’ He clasped her in his arms and kissed her, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears. <br> <br> ‘You are wet, my poor dear! I hope you'll not get cold,’ he said. And surveying her and her multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that by the hand she led a toddling child—a little girl of three or so—whose hood was as clammy and tender face as blue as those of the other travelers. <br> <br> ‘Who is this—somebody you know?’ asked Ned curiously. <br> <br> ‘Yes, Ned. She's mine.’ <br> <br> ‘Yours?’ <br> <br> ‘Yes—my own.’ <br> <br> ‘Your own child?’ <br> <br> ‘Yes!’<br> <br> ‘But who's the father?’ <br> <br> ‘The young man I had after you courted me.’ <br> <br> ‘Well—as God's in—’ <br> <br> ‘Ned, I didn't name it in my letter, because, you see, it would have been so hard to explain! I thought that when we met I could tell you how she happened to be born, so much better than in writing! I hope you'll excuse it this once, dear Ned, and scold me, now I've come so many, many miles!’ <br> <br> ‘This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!’ said Hipcroft, gazing palely at them from the distance of the yard or two to which he had withdrawn with a start. <br> <br> Car'line gasped. ‘But he's been gone away for years!’ she supplicated. ‘And I never had a young man before! And I was so onlucky to be catched the first time he took advantage o' me, though some of the girls down there go on like anything!’ <br> <br> Ned remained in silence, pondering. <br> <br> ‘You'll forgive me, dear Ned?’ she added, beginning to sob outright. ‘I haven't taken 'ee in after all, because—because you can pack us back again, if you want to; though 'tis hundreds o' miles, and so wet, and night a-coming on, and I with no money! <br> <br> ‘What the devil can I do!’ Hipcroft groaned. <br> <br> A more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures presented was never seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the great, gaunt, puddled platform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under the roof upon them now and then; the pretty attire in which they had started from Stickleford in the early morning bemuddled and sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of him in their eyes; for the child began to look as if she thought she too had done some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears rolled down her chubby cheeks. <br> <br> ‘What's the matter, my little maid?’ said Ned mechanically. <br> <br> ‘I do want to go home!’ she let out, in tones that told of a bursting heart. ‘And my totties be cold, an' I shan't have no bread an' butter no more!’ <br> <br> ‘I don't know what to say to it all!’ declared Ned, his own eye moist as he turned and walked a few steps with his head down; then regarded them again point-blank. From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently welling tears. <br> <br> ‘Want some bread and butter, do 'ee?’ he said, with factitious hardness. <br> <br> ‘Ye—e—s!’ <br> <br> ‘Well, I dare say I can get 'ee a bit! Naturally, you must want some. And you, too, for that matter, Car'line.’ <br> <br> ‘I do feel a little hungered. But I can keep it off,’ she murmured. <br> <br> ‘Folk shouldn't do that,’ he said gruffly. . . . ‘There, come along!’ He caught up the child, as he added, ‘You must bide here tonight, anyhow, I s'pose! What can you do otherwise? I'll get 'ee some tea and victuals; and as for this job, I'm sure I don't know what to say! This is the way out.’ <br> <br> They pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned's lodgings, which were not far off. There he dried them and made them comfortable, and prepared tea; they thankfully sat down. The ready-made household of which he suddenly found himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a paternal one to himself. Presently he turned to the child and kissed her now blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at Car'line, kissed her also. <br> <br> ‘I don't see how I can send you back all them miles,’ he growled, ‘now you've come all the way o' purpose to join me. But you must trust me, Car'line, and show you've real faith in me, Well, do you feel better now, my little woman?’ <br> <br> The child nodded beamingly, her mouth being otherwise occupied.<br> <br> ‘I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall always!’ <br> <br> Thus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he tacitly acquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on the day of their marriage (which was not quite so soon as he had expected it could be, on account of the time necessary for banns) he took her to the Exhibition when they came back from church, as he had promised. While standing near a large mirror in one of the courts devoted to furniture, Car'line started, for in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly resembling Mop Ollamoor's—so exactly, that it seemed impossible to believe anybody but that artist in person to be the original. On passing round the objects which hemmed in Ned, her, and the child from a direct view, no Mop was to be seen. Whether he were really in London or not at that time was never known; and Car'line always stoutly denied that her readiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumor that Mop had also gone thither; which denial there was no reasonable ground for doubting. <br> <br> And then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded itself up and became a thing of the past. The park trees that had been enclosed for six months were again exposed to the winds and storms, and the sod grew green anew. Ned found that Car'line resolved herself into a very good wife and companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to him; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap tea-pot, which often brews better tea than a dear one. One autumn Hipcroft found himself with but little work to do, and a prospect of less for the winter. Both being country born and bred, they fancied they would like to live again in their natural atmosphere. It was accordingly decided between them that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that Ned should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and her daughter staying with Car'line's father during the search for occupation and an abode of their own. <br> <br> Tinglings of pride pervaded Car'line's spasmodic little frame as she journeyed down with Ned to the place she had left two or three years before, in silence and under a cloud. To return to where she had once been despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent, was a triumph which the world did not witness every day. <br> <br> The train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay nearest to Stickleford, and the trio went on to Casterbridge. Ned thought it a good opportunity to make a few preliminary inquiries for employment at workshops in the borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from her journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a moon on the point of rising, Car'line and her little girl walked on toward Stickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker pace, and pick her up at a certain halfway house, widely known as an inn. <br> <br> ‘The woman and child pursued the well-remembered way comfortably enough, though they were both becoming wearied. In the course of three miles they had passed Heedless-William's Pond, the familiar landmark by Bloom's End, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman, a lone roadside hostel on the lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since and for many years abolished. In stepping up toward it Car'line heard more voices within than had formerly been customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction of fat stock had been held near the spot that afternoon. The child would be the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought, and she entered. <br> <br> The guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and Car'line had no sooner crossed the threshold than a man whom she remembered by sight came forward with a glass and mug in his hands toward a friend leaning against the wall; but, seeing her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the liquor, which was gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and saying, in a moment or two: ‘Surely, 'tis little Car'line Aspent that was down at Stickleford?’ <br> <br> She assented, and, though she did not exactly want this beverage, she drank it since it was offered, and her entertainer begged her to come in further and sit down. Once within the room she found that all the persons present were seated close against the walls, and there being a chair vacant she did the same. An explanation of their position occurred the next moment. In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow and looking just the same as ever. The company had cleared the middle of the room for dancing, and they were about to dance again. As she wore a veil to keep off the wind she did not think he had recognized her, or could possibly guess the identity of the child; and to her satisfied surprise she found that she could confront him quite calmly—mistress of herself in the dignity her London life had given her. Before she had quite emptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two lines, the music sounded, and the figure began. <br> <br> Then matters changed for Car'line. A tremor quickened itself to life in her, and her hand so shook that she could hardly set down her glass. It was not the dance nor the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which thrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she had so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power of independent will. How it all came back! There was the fiddling figure against the wall; the large, oily, mop-like head of him, and beneath the mop the face with closed eyes. <br> <br> After the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune in the familiar rendering made her laugh and shed tears simultaneously. Then a man at the bottom of the dance, whose partner had dropped away, stretched out his hand and beckoned to her to take the place. She did not want to dance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she was entreating of the tune and its player rather than of the dancing man. The salutatory tendency which the fiddler and his cunning instrument had ever been able to start in her was seizing Car'line just as it had done in earlier years, possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot. Tired as she was she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the bottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest. She found that her companions were mostly people of the neighboring hamlets and farms—Bloom's End, Mellstock, Lewgate, and elsewhere; and by degrees she was recognized as she convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would cease and let her heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet also.<br> <br> After long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was urged to fortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did, feeling very weak and overpowered with hysteric emotion. She refrained from unveiling, to keep Mop in ignorance of her presence, if possible. Several of the guests having left, Car'line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to go; but, according to the account of some who remained, at that very moment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three begged her to join. <br> <br> She declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to Stickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling ‘My Fancy-Lad,’ in D major, as the air to which the reel was to be footed. He must have recognized her, though she did not know it, for it was the strain of all seductive strains which she was least able to resist—the one he had played when she was leaning over the bridge at the date of their first acquaintance. Car'line stepped despairingly into the middle of the room with the other four. <br> <br> Reels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more robust spirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the ordinary figure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust. As everybody knows, or does not know, the five reelers stood in the form of a cross, the reel being performed by each line of three alternately, the persons who successively came to the middle place dancing in both directions. Car'line soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole performance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into the first part without giving her opportunity. And now she began to suspect that Mop did know her, and was doing this on purpose, though whenever she stole a glance at him his closed eyes betokened obliviousness to everything outside his own brain. She continued to wend her way through the figure of eight that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing into his notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one too highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in endless variation, projecting through her nerves excruciating spasms, a sort of blissful torture. The room swam, the tune was endless; and in about a quarter of an hour the only other woman in the figure dropped out exhausted, and sank panting on a bench.<br> <br> The reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed one. Car'line would have given anything to leave off; but she had, or fancied she had, no power, while Mop played such tunes; and thus another ten minutes slipped by, a haze of dust now clouding the candles, the floor being of stone, sanded. Then another dancer fell out—one of the men—and went into the passage in a frantic search for liquor. To turn the figure into a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop modulating at the same time into ‘The Fairy Dance,’ as better suited to the contracted movement, and no less one of those foods of love which, as manufactured by his bow, had always intoxicated her. <br> <br> In a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or five minutes were enough to make her remaining two partners, now thoroughly blown, stamp their last bar, and, like their predecessors, limp off into the next room to get something to drink. Car'line, half-stifled inside her veil, was left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody save herself, Mop, and their little girl.<br> <br> <br> <br> She flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if imploring him to withdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from the atmosphere. Mop opened one of his own orbs, as though for the first time, fixed it peeringly upon her, and smiling dreamily, threw into his strains the reserve of expression which he could not afford to waste on a big and noisy dance. Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable drawing tears from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as if it were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it ever since its banishment from some Italian or German city where it first took shape and sound. There was that in the look of Mop's one dark eye which said: ‘You cannot leave off, dear, whether you would or no!’ and it bred in her a paroxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down. <br> <br> She thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought, but in truth slavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the melody, and probed by the gimlet-like gaze of her fascinator's open eye; keeping up at the same time a feeble smile in his face, as feint to signify it was still her own pleasure which led her on. A terrified embarrassment as to what she could say to him if she were to leave off, had its unrecognized share in keeping her going. The child, who was beginning to be distressed by the strange situation, came up and whimpered: ‘Stop, mother, stop, and let's go home!’ as she seized Car'line's hand. <br> <br> Suddenly Car'line sank staggering to the floor, and rolling over on her face, prone she remained. Mop's fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek of finality; stepping quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which had formed his rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately bent over her mother. <br> <br> The guests who had gone into the backroom for liquor and change of air, hearing something unusual, trooped back hitherward, where they endeavored to revive poor, weak Car'line by blowing her with the bellows and opening the window. Ned, her husband, who had been detained in Casterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture, and hearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his great surprise, the mention of his wife's name, he entered amid the rest upon the scene. Car'line was now in convulsions, weeping violently, and for a long time nothing could be done with her. While he was sending for a cart to take her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired, how it had all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler formerly known in the locality had lately visited his old haunts, and had taken upon himself without invitation to play that evening at the inn and raise a dance. Ned demanded the fiddler's name, and they said Ollamoor. <br> <br> ‘Ah!’ exclaimed Ned, looking round him. ‘Where is he, and where—where's my little girl?’ <br> <br> Ollamoor had disappeared, and so had the child. Hipcroft was in ordinary a quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination which was to be feared settled in his face now. ‘Blast him!’ he cried. ‘I'll beat his skull in for'n, if I swing for it tomorrow!’ <br> <br> He had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and has tened down the passage, the people following. Outside the house, on the other side of the highway, a mass of dark heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not easily accessible interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the sky, at the distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover backed by the Yalbury coppices—a place of Dantesque gloom at this hour, which would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of artillery, much less a man and a child. <br> <br> Some other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went along the road. They were gone about twenty minutes altogether, returning without result to the inn. Ned sat down in the settle, and clasped his forehead with his hands. <br> <br> ‘Well—what a fool the man is, and hev been all these years, if he thinks the child his, as a' do seem to!’ they whispered. ‘And everybody else knowing otherwise!’ <br> <br> ‘No, I don't think 'tis mine!’ cried Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from his hands. ‘But she is mine, all the same! Ha'n't I nussed her? Ha'n't I fed her and teached her? Ha'n't I played wi' her? O, little Carry—gone with that rogue—gone!’ <br> <br> ‘You ha'n't lost your mis'ess, anyhow,’ they said to console him. ‘She's throwed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and she's more to 'ee than a child that isn't yours.’<br> <br> ‘She isn't! She's not so particular much to me, especially now she's lost the little maid! But Carry's the whole world to me!’ <br> <br> ‘Well, ver' like you'll find her tomorrow.’ <br> <br> ‘Ah—but shall I? Yet he can't hurt her—surely he can't! Well—how's Car'line now? I am ready. Is the cart here?’<br> <br> She was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on toward Stickleford. Next day she was calmer; but the fits were still upon her; and her will seemed shattered. For the child she appeared to show singularly little anxiety, though Ned was nearly distracted by his passionate paternal love for a child not his own. It was nevertheless quite expected that the impish Mop would restore the lost one after a freak of a day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor she could be heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was exercising upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon Car'line herself. Weeks passed, and still they could obtain no clue either to the fiddler's whereabouts or to the girl's; and how he induced her to go with him remained a mystery. <br> <br> Then Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the neighborhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district, and a rumor reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat similar man and child had been seen at a fair near London, he playing a violin, she dancing on stilts, a new interest in the capital took possession of Hipcroft with an intensity which would scarcely allow him time to pack before returning thither. He did not, however find the lost one, though he made it the entire business of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in the hope of discovering her, and would start up in the night, saying, ‘That rascal's torturing her to maintain him!’ To which his wife would answer peevishly, ‘Don't 'ee raft yourself so, Ned! You prevent my getting a bit o' rest! He won't hurt her!’ and fall asleep again.<br> <br> That Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the general opinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion when he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer. There, for that matter, they may be performing in some capacity now, though he must bean old scamp verging on three-score-and-ten, and she a woman of four-and-forty.<br> <br> May 1893.</p><br>When William Marchmill had finished his inquiries for lodgings at the well-known watering-place of Solentsea in Upper Wessex, he returned to the hotel to find his wife. She, with the children, had rambled along the shore, and Marchmill followed in the direction indicated by the military-looking hall-porter.<br><br>‘By Jove, how far you've gone!  I am quite out of breath,’ Marchmill said, rather impatiently, when he came up with his wife, who was reading as she walked, the three children being considerably further ahead with the nurse.<br><br>Mrs. Marchmill started out of the reverie into which the book had thrown her.  ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘you've been such a long time.  I was tired of staying in that dreary hotel.  But I am sorry if you have wanted me, Will?’<br><br>‘Well I have had trouble to suit myself.  When you see the airy and comfortable rooms heard of, you find they are stuffy and uncomfortable.  Will you come and see if what I've fixed on will do?  There is not much room, I am afraid; but I can light on nothing better.  The town is rather full.’<br><br>The pair left the children and nurse to continue their ramble, and went back together.<br><br>In age well-balanced, in personal appearance fairly matched, and in domestic requirements conformable, in temper this couple differed, though even here they did not often clash, he being equable, if not lymphatic, and she decidedly nervous and sanguine.  It was to their tastes and fancies, those smallest, greatest particulars, that no common denominator could be applied.  Marchmill considered his wife's likes and inclinations somewhat silly; she considered his sordid and material.  The husband's business was that of a gunmaker in a thriving city northwards, and his soul was in that business always; the lady was best characterized by that superannuated phrase of elegance ‘a votary of the muse.’ An impressionable, palpitating creature was Ella, shrinking humanely from detailed knowledge of her husband's trade whenever she reflected that everything he manufactured had for its purpose the destruction of life.  She could only recover her equanimity by assuring herself that some, at least, of his weapons were sooner or later used for the extermination of horrid vermin and animals almost as cruel to their inferiors in species as human beings were to theirs.<br><br>She had never antecedently regarded this occupation of his as any objection to having him for a husband.  Indeed, the necessity of getting life-leased at all cost, a cardinal virtue which all good mothers teach, kept her from thinking of it at all till she had closed with William, had passed the honeymoon, and reached the reflecting stage. Then, like a person who has stumbled upon some object in the dark, she wondered what she had got; mentally walked round it, estimated it; whether it were rare or common; contained gold, silver, or lead; were a clog or a pedestal, everything to her or nothing.<br><br>She came to some vague conclusions, and since then had kept her heart alive by pitying her proprietor's obtuseness and want of refinement, pitying herself, and letting off her delicate and ethereal emotions in imaginative occupations, daydreams, and night-sighs, which perhaps would not much have disturbed William if he had known of them.<br><br>Her figure was small, elegant, and slight in build, tripping, or rather bounding, in movement.  She was dark-eyed, and had that marvelously bright and liquid sparkle in each pupil which characterizes persons of Ella's cast of soul, and is too often a cause of heartache to the possessor's male friends, ultimately sometimes to herself.  Her husband was a tall, long-featured man, with a brown beard; he had a pondering regard; and was, it must be added, usually kind and tolerant to her.  He spoke in squarely shaped sentences, and was supremely satisfied with a condition of sublunary things which made weapons a necessity.<br><br>Husband and wife walked till they had reached the house they were in search of, which stood in a terrace facing the sea, and was fronted by a small garden of windproof and salt-proof evergreens, stone steps leading up to the porch.  It had its number in the row, but, being rather larger than the rest, was in addition sedulously distinguished as Coburg House by its landlady, though everybody else called it ‘Thirteen, New Parade.’  The spot was bright and lively now; but in winter it became necessary to place sandbags against the door, and to stuff up the keyhole against the wind and rain, which had worn the paint so thin that the priming and knotting showed through.<br><br>The householder, who had been watching for the gentleman's return, met them in the passage, and showed the rooms.  She informed them that she was a professional man's widow, left in needy circumstances by the rather sudden death of her husband, and she spoke anxiously of the conveniences of the establishment.<br><br>Mrs. Marchmill said that she liked the situation and the house; but, it being small, there would not be accommodation enough, unless she could have all the rooms.<br><br>The landlady mused with an air of disappointment.  She wanted the visitors to be her tenants very badly, she said, with obvious honesty.  But unfortunately two of the rooms were occupied permanently by a bachelor gentleman.  He did not pay season prices, it was true; but as he kept on his apartments all the year round, and was all extremely nice and interesting young man, who gave no trouble, she did not like to turn him out for a month's ‘let,’ even at a high figure.  ‘Perhaps, however,’ she added, ‘he might offer to go for a time.’<br><br>They would not hear of this, and went back to the hotel, intending to proceed to the agent’s to inquire further.  Hardly had they sat down to tea when the landlady called. Her gentleman, she said, had been so obliging as to offer to give up his rooms three or four weeks rather than drive the newcomers away.<br><br>‘It is very kind, but we won't inconvenience him in that way,’ said the Marchmills.<br><br>O, it won't inconvenience him, I assure you!’ said the landlady eloquently.  ‘You see, he's a different sort of young man from most—dreamy, solitary, rather melancholy—and he cares more to be here when the south-westerly gales are beating against the door, and the sea washes over the Parade, and there's not a soul in the place, than he does now in the season.  He'd just as soon be where, in fact, he's going temporarily to a little cottage on the Island opposite, for a change.’  She hoped therefore that they would come.<br><br>The Marchmill family accordingly took possession of the house next day, and it seemed to suit them very well.  After luncheon Mr. Marchmill strolled out toward the pier, and Mrs. Marchmill, having despatched the children to their outdoor amusements on the sands, settled herself in more completely, examining this and that article, and testing the reflecting powers of the mirror in the wardrobe door.<br><br>In the small back sitting room, which had been the young bachelor's, she found furniture of a more personal nature than in the rest.  Shabby books, of correct rather than rare editions, were piled up in a queerly reserved manner in corners, as if the previous occupant had not conceived the possibility that any incoming person of the season’s bringing could care to look inside them.  The landlady hovered on the threshold to rectify anything that Mrs. Marchmill might not find to her satisfaction.<br><br>‘I’ll make this my own little room,’ said the latter, ‘because the books are here. By the way, the person who has left seems to have a good many.  He won't mind my reading some of them, Mrs. Hooper, I hope?’<br><br>‘O, dear no, ma'am.  Yes, he has a good many.  You see, he is in the literary line himself somewhat.  He is a poet — yes, really a poet—and he has a little income of his own, which is enough to write verses on, but not enough for cutting a figure, even if he cared to.<br><br>‘A Poet! O, I did not know that.’<br><br>Mrs. Marchmill opened one of the books, and saw the owner's name written on the title-page.  ‘Dear me!’ she continued; ‘I know his name very well—Robert Trewe—of course I do; and his writings!  And it is his rooms we have taken, and him we have turned out of his home?’<br><br>Ella Marchmill, sitting down alone a few minutes later, thought with interested surprise of Robert Trewe.  Her own latter history will best explain that interest.  Herself the only daughter of a struggling man of letters, she had during the last year or two taken to writing poems, in an endeavor to find a congenial channel in which let flow her painfully embayed emotions, whose former limpidity and sparkle seemed departing in the stagnation caused by the routine of a practical household and the gloom of bearing children to a commonplace father.  These poems, subscribed with masculine pseudonym, had appeared in various obscure magazines, and in two cases in rather prominent ones.  In the second of the latter the page which bore her effusion at the bottom, in smallish print, bore at the top, in large print, a few verses on the same subject by this very man, Robert Trewe.  Both of them, had, in fact, been struck by a tragic incident reported in the daily papers, and had used it simultaneously as an inspiration, the editor remarking in a note upon the coincidence, and that the excellence of both poems prompted him to give them together.<br><br>After that event Ella, otherwise ‘John Ivy,’ had watched with much attention the appearance anywhere in print of verse bearing the signature of Robert Trewe, who, with a man's unsusceptibility on the question of sex, had never once thought of passing himself off as a woman.  To be sure, Mrs. Marchmill had satisfied herself with a sort of reason for doing the contrary in her case; since nobody might believe in her inspiration if they found that the sentiments came from a pushing tradesman's wife, from the mother of three children by a matter-of -fact small-arms manufacturer.<br><br>Trewe's verse contrasted with that of the rank and file of recent minor poets in being impassioned rather than ingenious, luxuriant rather than finished.  Neither symboliste nor decadent, he was a pessimist in so far as that character applies to a man who looks at the worst contingencies as well as the best in the human condition.  Being little attracted by excellences of form and rhythm apart from content, he sometimes, when feeling outran his artistic speed, perpetrated sonnets in the loosely rhymed Elizabethan fashion, which every right-minded reviewer said he ought not to have done.<br><br>With sad and hopeless envy Ella Marchmill had often and often scanned the rival poet's work, so much stronger as it always was than her own feeble lines.  She had imitated him, and her inability to touch his level would send her into fits of despondency. Months passed away thus, till she observed from the publishers' list that Trewe had collected his fugitive pieces into a volume, which was duly issued, and was much or little praised according to chance, and had a sale quite sufficient to pay for the printing.<br><br>This step onward had suggested to John Ivy the idea of collecting her pieces also, or at any rate of making up a book of her rhymes by adding many in manuscript to the few that had seen the light, for she had been able to get no great number into print. A ruinous charge was made for costs of publication; a few reviews noticed her poor little volume; but nobody talked of it, nobody bought it, and it fell dead in a fortnight—if it had ever been alive.<br><br>The author's thoughts were diverted to another groove just then by the discovery that she was going to have a third child, and the collapse of her poetical venture had perhaps less effect upon her mind than it might have done if she had been domestically unoccupied.  Her husband had paid the publisher's bill with the doctor's, and there it all had ended for the time.  But, though less than a poet of her century, Ella was more than a mere multiplier of her kind, and latterly she had begun to feel the old afflatus once more.  And now by an odd conjunction she found herself in the rooms of Robert Trewe.<br><br>She thoughtfully rose from her chair and searched the apartment with the interest of a fellow-tradesman.  Yes, the volume of his own verse was among the rest.  Though quite familiar with its contents, she read it here as if it spoke aloud to her, then called up Mrs. Hooper, the landlady, for some trivial service, and inquired again about the young man.<br><br>‘Well, I'm sure you'd be interested in him, ma'am, if you could see him, only he's so shy that I don't suppose you will.’ Mrs. Hooper seemed nothing loth to minister to her tenant's curiosity about her predecessor.  ‘Lived here long? Yes, nearly two years.  He keeps on his rooms even when he's not here: the soft air of this place suits his chest, and he likes to be able to come back at any time.  He is mostly writing or reading, and doesn't see many people, though, for the matter of that, he is such a good, kind young fellow that folks would only be too glad to be friendly with him if they knew him.  You don't meet kind-hearted people everyday.’<br><br>‘Ah, he's kind-hearted . . . and good.’<br><br>‘Yes; he'll oblige me in anything if I ask him.  'Mr. Trewe,' I say to him sometimes, you are rather out of spirits.' 'Well, I am, Mrs. Hooper,' he'll say, 'though I don't know how you should find it out.' 'Why not take a little change?' I ask.  Then in a day or two he'll say that he will take a trip to Paris, or Norway, or somewhere; and I assure you he comes back all the better for it.’<br><br>‘Ah, indeed!  His is a sensitive nature, no doubt.’<br><br>‘Yes.  Still he's odd in some things.  Once when he had finished a poem of his composition late at night he walked up and down the room rehearsing it; and the floors being so thin—jerry-built houses, you know, though I say it myself—he kept me awake up above him till I wished him further. . . . But we get on very well.’<br><br>This was but the beginning of a series of conversations about the rising poet as the days went on.  On one of these occasions Mrs. Hooper drew Ella's attention to what she had not noticed before: minute scribblings in pencil on the wallpaper behind the curtains at the head of the bed.<br><br>‘O! let me look,’ said Mrs. Marchmill, unable to conceal a rush of tender curiosity as she bent her pretty face close to the wall.<br><br>‘These,’ said Mrs. Hooper, with the manner of a woman who knew things, ‘are the very beginnings and first thoughts of his verses.  He has tried to rub most of them out, but you can read them still.  My belief is that he wakes up in the night, you know, with some rhyme in his head, and jots it down there on the wall lest he should forget it by the morning.  Some of these very lines you see here I have seen afterwards in print in the magazines.  Some are newer; indeed, I have not seen that one before.  It must have been done only a few days ago.’<br><br>‘O,  yes! . . . ‘ Ella Marchmill flushed without knowing why, and suddenly wished her companion would go away, now that the information was imparted.  An indescribable consciousness of personal interest rather than literary made her anxious to read the inscription alone; and she accordingly waited till she could do so, with a sense that a great store of emotion would be enjoyed in the act.<br><br>Perhaps because the sea was choppy outside the Island, Ella's husband found it much pleasanter to go sailing and steaming about without his wife, who was a bad sailor, than with her.  He did not disdain to go thus alone on board the steamboats of the cheap-trippers, where there was dancing by moonlight, and where the couples would come suddenly down with a lurch into each other's arms; for, as he blandly told her, the company was too mixed for him to take her amid such scenes.  Thus, while this thriving manufacturer got a great deal of change and sea-air out of his sojourn here, the life, external at least, of Ella was monotonous enough, and mainly consisted in passing a certain number of hours each day in bathing and walking up and down a stretch of shore.  But the poetic impulse having again waxed strong, she was possessed by an inner flame which left her hardly conscious of what was proceeding around her.<br><br>She had read till she knew by heart Trewe's last little volume of verses, and spent a great deal of time in vainly attempting to rival some of them, till, in her failure, she burst into tears.  The personal element in the magnetic attraction exercised by this circumambient, unapproachable master of hers was so much stronger than the intellectual and abstract that she could not understand it.  To be sure, she was surrounded noon and night by his customary environment, which literally whispered of him to her at every moment; but he was a man she had never seen, and that all that moved her was the instinct to specialize a waiting emotion on the first fit thing that came to hand did not, of course, suggest itself to Ella.<br><br>In the natural way of passion under the too practical conditions which civilization has devised for its fruition, her husband's love for her had not survived, except in the form of fitful friendship, anymore than, or even so much as, her own for him; and, being a woman of very living ardors, that required sustenance of some sort, they were beginning to feed on this chancing material, which was, indeed, of a quality far better than chance usually offers.<br><br>One day the children had been playing hide-and-seek in a closet, whence, in their excitement they pulled out some clothing.  Mrs. Hooper explained that it belonged to Mr. Trewe, and hung it up in the closet again.  Possessed of her fantasy, Ella went later in the afternoon, when nobody was in that part of the house, opened the closet, unhitched one of the articles, a mackintosh, and put it on, with the waterproof cap belonging to it.<br><br>‘The mantle of Elijah!’ she said.  ‘Would it might inspire me to rival him, glorious genius that he is!’<br><br>Her eyes always grew wet when she thought like that, and she turned to look at herself in the glass.  His heart had beat inside that coat, and his brain had worked under that hat at levels of thought she would never reach.  The consciousness of her weakness beside him made her feel quite sick.  Before she had got the things off her the door opened, and her husband entered the room.<br><br>‘What the devil—’<br><br>She blushed, and removed them. ‘I found them in the closet here,’ she said, ‘and put them on in a freak.  What have I else to do?  You are always away!’<br><br>‘Always away?  Well. . .’<br><br>That evening she had a further talk with the landlady, who might herself have nourished a half-tender regard for the poet, so ready was she to discourse ardently about him.      ‘You are interested in Mr. Trewe, I know, ma'am,’ she said; ‘and he has just sent to say that he is going to call tomorrow afternoon to look up some books of his that he wants, if I'll be in, and he may select them from your room?’<br><br>‘O, yes!’<br><br>‘You could very well meet Mr. Trewe then, if you'd like to be in the way!’<br><br>She promised with secret delight, and went to bed musing of him.<br><br>Next morning her husband observed: ‘I've been thinking of what you said, Ell: that I have gone about a good deal and left you without much to amuse you.  Perhaps it's true.  Today, as there's not much sea, I'll take you with me on board the yacht.’<br><br>For the first time in her experience of such an offer Ella was not glad.  But she accepted it for the moment.  The time for setting out drew near, and she went to get ready.  She stood reflecting.  The longing to see the poet she was now distinctly in love with overpowered all other considerations.<br><br>‘I don't want to go,’ she said to herself.  ‘I can't bear to be away!  And I won't go.’<br><br>She told her husband that she had changed her mind about wishing to sail.  He was indifferent, and went his way.        For the rest of the day the house was quiet, the children having gone out upon the sands.  The blinds waved in the sunshine to the soft, steady stroke of the sea beyond the wall; and the notes of the Green Silesian band, a troop of foreign gentlemen hired for the season, had drawn almost all the residents and promenaders away from the vicinity of Coburg House.  A knock was audible at the door.<br><br>Mrs. Marchmill did not hear any servant go to answer it, and she became impatient.  The books were in the room where she sat; but nobody came up.  She rang the bell.   ‘There is some person waiting at the door,’ she said.<br><br>‘O, no, ma'am' He's gone long ago.  I answered it,’ the servant replied, and Mrs. Hooper came in herself.<br><br>‘So dissappointing!’ she said.  ‘Mr. Trewe not coming after all!’<br><br>‘But I heard him knock, I fancy!’<br><br>‘No; that was somebody inquiring for lodgings who came to the wrong house.  I tell you that Mr. Trewe sent a note just before lunch to say I needn't get any tea for him, as he should not require the books, and wouldn't come to select them.’<br><br>Ella was miserable, and for a long time could not even reread his mournful ballad on ‘Severed Lives,’ so aching was her erratic little heart, and so tearful her eyes.  When the children came in with wet stockings, and ran up to her to tell her of their adventures, she could not feel that she cared about them half as much as usual.<br><br>‘Mrs. Hooper, have you a photograph of—the gentleman who lived here?’ She was getting to be curiously shy in mentioning his name. <br><br>‘Why, yes.  It's in the ornamental frame on the mantelpiece in your own bedroom, ma'am.’<br><br>‘No; the Royal Duke and Duchess are in that.’<br><br>‘Yes, so they are; but he's behind them.  He belongs rightly to that frame, which I bought on purpose; but as he went away he said: ‘Cover me up from those strangers that are coming, for God's sake.  I don't want them staring at me, and I am sure they won't want me staring at them.’ So I slipped in the Duke and Duchess temporarily in front of him, as they had no frame, and Royalties are more suitable for letting furnished than a private young man.  If you take 'em out you'll see him under.  Lord, ma'am, he wouldn't mind if he knew it!  He didn't think the next tenant would be such an attractive lady as you, or he wouldn't have thought of hiding himself, perhaps.’<br><br>‘Is he handsome?’ she asked timidly.<br><br>‘I call him so.  Some, perhaps, wouldn't.’<br><br>‘Should I?’ she asked, with eagerness.<br><br>‘I think you would, though some would say he's more striking than handsome; a large-eyed thoughtful fellow, you know, with a very electric flash in his eye when he looks round quickly, such as you'd expect a poet to be who doesn't get his living by it.’<br><br>‘How old is he?’<br><br>‘Several years older than yourself, ma'am; about thirty-one or two, I think.’<br><br>Ella was a matter of fact, a few months over thirty herself; but she did not look nearly so much.  Though so immature in nature, she was entering on that tract of life in which emotional women begin to suspect that last love may be stronger than first love; and she would soon, alas, enter on the still more melancholy tract when at least the vainer ones of her sex shrink from receiving a male visitor otherwise than with their backs to the window or the blinds half down.  She reflected on Mrs. Hooper's remark, and said no more about age.<br><br>Just then a telegram was brought up.  It came from her husband, who had gone down the Channel as far as Budmouth with his friends in the yacht, and would not be able to get back till next day.<br><br>After her light dinner Ella idled about the shore with the children till dusk, thinking of the yet uncovered photograph in her room, with a serene sense of in which this something ecstatic to come.  For, with the subtle luxuriousness of fancy in which this young woman was an adept, on learning that her husband was to be absent that night she had refrained from incontinently rushing upstairs and, opening the picture-frame, preferring to reserve the inspection till she could be alone, and a more romantic tinge be imparted to the occasion by silence, candles, solemn sea and stars outside, than was afforded by the garish afternoon sunlight.<br><br>The children had been sent to bed, and Ella soon followed, though it was not yet ten o'clock.  To gratify her passionate curiosity she now made her preparations, first getting rid of superfluous garments and putting on her dressing-gown, then arranging a chair in front of the table and reading several pages of Trewe's tenderest utterances. Next she fetched the portrait-frame to the light, opened the back, took out the likeness, and set it up before her.<br><br>It was a striking countenance to look upon.  The poet wore a luxuriant black moustache and imperial, and a slouched hat which shaded the forehead.  The large dark eyes described by the landlady showed an unlimited capacity for misery, they looked out from beneath well-shaped brows as if they were reading the universe in the microcosm of the confronter's face, and were not altogether overjoyed at what the spectacle portended.<br><br>Ella murmured in her lowest, richest, tenderest tone: ‘And it's you who’ve so cruelly eclipsed me these many times!’<br><br>As she gazed long at the portrait she fell into thought, till her eyes filled with tears, and she touched the cardboard with her lips.  Then she laughed with a nervous lightness, and wiped her eyes.<br><br>She thought how wicked she was, a woman having a husband and three children, to let her mind stray to a stranger in this unconscionable manner.  No, he was not a stranger!  She knew his thoughts and feelings as well as she knew her own; they were, in fact, the self-same thoughts and feelings as hers, which her husband distinctly lacked; perhaps luckily for himself, considering that he had to provide for family expenses.<br><br>‘He's nearer my real self, he's more intimate with the real me than Will is, after all, even though I've never seen him,’ she said.<br><br>She laid his book and picture on the table at the bedside, and when she was reclining on the pillow she re-read those of Robert Trewe's verses which she had marked from time to time as most touching and true.  Putting these aside she set up the photograph on its edge upon the coverlet, and contemplated it as she lay.  Then she scanned again by the light of the candle the half-obliterated pencillings on the wallpaper beside her head.  There they were—phrases, couplets, bouts-rimes, beginnings and middles of lines, ideas in the rough, like Shelley's scraps, and the least of them so intense, so sweet, so palpitating, that it seemed as if his very breath, warm and loving, fanned her cheeks from those walls, walls that had surrounded his head times and times as they surrounded her own now.  He must often have put up his hand so—with the pencil in it.  Yes, the writing was sideways, as it would be if executed by one who extended his arm thus.<br><br>These inscribed shapes of the poet's world,<br><br>‘Forms more real than living man,<br><br>Nurslings of immortality,’<br><br>were, no doubt, the thoughts and spirit-strivings which had come to him in the dead of night, when he could let himself go and have no fear of the frost of criticism.  No doubt they had often been written up hastily by the light of the moon, the rays of the lamp, in the blue-gray dawn, in full daylight perhaps never.  And now her hair was dragging where his arm had lain when he secured the fugitive fancies; she was sleeping on a poet's lips, immersed in the very essence of him, permeated by his spirit as by an ether.<br><br>While she was dreaming the minutes away thus, a footstep came upon the stairs, and in a moment she heard her husband's heavy step on the landing immediately without.<br><br>‘Ell, where are you?’<br><br>What possessed her she could not have described, but, with an instinctive objection to let her husband know what she had been doing, she slipped the photograph under the pillow just as he flung open the door with the air of a man who had dined not badly.<br><br>‘O, I beg pardon,’ said William Marchmill.  ‘Have you a headache?  I am afraid I have disturbed you.’<br><br>‘No, I've not got a headache,’ said she.  ‘How is it you've come?’<br><br>‘Well, we found we could get back in very good time after all, and I didn't want to make another day of it, because of going somewhere else tomorrow.’<br><br>‘Shall I come down again?’<br><br>‘O, no.  I'm as tired as a dog.  I've had a good feed, and I shall turn in straight off. I want to get out at six o'clock tomorrow if I can. . . . I shan't disturb you by my getting up; it will be long before you are awake.’ And he came forward into the room.<br><br>While her eyes followed his movements, Ella softly pushed the photograph further out of sight.<br><br>‘Sure you're not ill?’ he asked, bending over her.<br><br>‘No, only wicked!’<br><br>‘Never mind that.’ And he stooped and kissed her.  ‘I wanted to be with you tonight.’<br><br>Next morning Marchmill was called at six o'clock; and in waking and yawning he heard him muttering to himself.  ‘What the deuce is this that's been crackling under me so?’ Imagining her asleep he searched round him and withdrew something.  Through her half-opened eyes she perceived it to be Mr. Trewe.<br><br>‘Well, I'm damned!’ her husband exclaimed.<br><br>‘What, dear?’ said she.<br><br>‘O, you are awake?  Ha! ha!’<br><br>‘What do you mean?’<br><br>‘Some bloke's photograph—a friend of our landlady's, I suppose.  I wonder how it came here; whisked off the mantelpiece by accident perhaps when they were making the bed.’<br><br>‘I was looking at it yesterday, and it must have dropped in then.’<br><br>‘O, he's a friend of yours?  Bless his picturesque heart!’<br><br>Ella's loyalty to the object of her admiration could not endure to hear him ridiculed.  ‘He's a clever man!’ she said, with a tremor in her gentle voice which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for.  ‘He is a rising poet—the gentleman who occupied two of these rooms before we came, though I've never seen him.’<br><br>‘How do you know, if you've never seen him?’<br><br>‘Mrs. Hooper told me when she showed me the photograph.’<br><br>‘O, well, I must up and be off.  I shall be home rather early.  Sorry I can't take you today dear.  Mind the children don't go getting drowned.’<br><br>That day Mrs. Marchmill inquired if Mr. Trewe were likely to call at any other time.<br><br>‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Hooper.  ‘He's coming this day week to stay with a friend near here till you leave.  He'll be sure to call.’<br><br>Marchmill did return quite early in the afternoon; and, opening some letters which had arrived in his absence, declared suddenly that he and his family would have to leave a week earlier than they had expected to do—in short, in three days.<br><br>‘Surely we can stay a week longer?’ she pleaded.  ‘I like it here.’<br><br>‘I don't.  It is getting rather slow.’<br><br>‘Then you might leave me and the children!’<br><br>‘How perverse you are, Ell!  What's the use?  And have to come to fetch you! No: we'll all return together; and we'll make out our time in North Wales or Brighton a little later on.  Besides, you've three days longer yet.’<br><br>It seemed to be her doom not to meet the man for whose rival talent she had a despairing admiration, and to whose person she was now absolutely attached.  Yet she determined to make a last effort; and having gathered from her landlady that Trewe was living in a lonely spot not far from the fashionable town on the Island opposite, she crossed over in the packet from the neighboring pier the following afternoon.<br><br>What a useless journey it was! Ella knew but vaguely where the house stood, and when she fancied she had found it, and ventured to inquire of a pedestrian if he lived there, the answer returned by the man was that he did not know.  And if he did live there, how could she call upon him?  Some women might have the assurance to do it, but she had not.  How crazy he would think her.  She might have asked him to call upon her, perhaps; but she had not the courage for that, either.  She lingered mournfully about the picturesque seaside eminence till it was time to return to the town and enter the steamer for recrossing, reaching home for dinner without having been greatly missed.<br><br>At the last moment, unexpectedly enough, her husband said that he should have no objection to letting her and the children stay on till the end of the week, since she wished to do so, if she felt herself able to get home without him.  She concealed the pleasure this extension of time gave her; and Marchmill went off the next morning alone. <br><br>But the week passed, and Trewe did not call.<br><br>On Saturday morning the remaining members of the Marchmill family departed from the place which had been productive of so much fervor in her.  The dreary, dreary train; the sun shining in moted beams upon the hot cushions; the dusty permanent way; the mean rows of wire—these things were her accompaniment: while out of the window the deep blue sea-levels disappeared from her gaze, and with them her poet's home. Heavy-hearted, she tried to read, and wept instead.<br><br>Mr. Marchmill was in a thriving way of business, and he and his family lived in a large new house, which stood in rather extensive grounds a few miles outside the midland city wherein he carried on his trade.  Ella's life was lonely here, as the suburban life is apt to be, particularly at certain seasons; and she had ample time to indulge her taste for lyric and elegiac composition.  She had hardly got back when she encountered a piece by Robert Trewe in the new number of her favorite magazine, which must have been written almost immediately before her visit to Solentsea, for it contained the very couplet she had seen penciled on the wallpaper by the bed, and Mrs. Hooper had declared to be recent.  Ella could resist no longer, but seizing a pen impulsively, wrote to him as a brother-poet, using the name of John Ivy, congratulating him in her letter on his triumphant executions in meter and rhythm of thoughts that moved his soul, as compared with her own brow-beaten efforts in the same pathetic trade.<br><br>To this address there came a response in a few days, little as she had dared to hope for it—a civil and brief note, in which the young poet stated that, though he was not well acquainted with Mr. Ivy's verse, he recalled the name as being one he had seen attached to some very promising pieces; that he was glad to gain Mr. Ivy's acquaintance by letter, and should certainly look with much interest for his productions in the future.<br><br>There must have been something juvenile or timid in her own epistle, as one ostensibly coming from a man, she declared to herself; for Trewe quite adopted the tone of an elder and superior in this reply.  But what did it matter?  He had replied; he had written to her with his own hand from that very room she knew so well, for he was now back again in his quarters.<br><br>The correspondence thus begun was continued for two months or more, Ella Marchmill sending him from time to time some that she considered to be the best her pieces, which he very kindly accepted, though he did not say he sedulously read them, nor did he send her any of his own in return.  Ella would have been more hurt at this than she was if she had not known that Trewe labored under the impression that she was one of his own sex.<br><br>Yet the situation was unsatisfactory.  A flattering little voice told her that, were he only to see her, matters would be otherwise.  No doubt she would have helped on this by making a frank confession of womanhood, to begin with, if something had not appeared, to her delight, to render it unnecessary.  A friend of her husband's, the editor of the most important newspaper in their city and county, who was dining with them one day, observed during their conversation about the poet that his (the editor's) brother the landscape-painter was a friend of Mr. Trewe's, and that the two men were at that very moment in Wales together.<br><br>Ella was slightly acquainted with the editor's brother.  The next morning down she sat and wrote, inviting him to stay at her house for a short time on his way back, and to bring with him, if practicable, his companion Mr. Trewe, whose acquaintance she was anxious to make.  The answer arrived after some few days.  Her correspondent and his friend Trewe would have much satisfaction in accepting her invitation on their way southward, which would be on such and such a day in the following week.<br><br>Ella was blithe and buoyant.  Her scheme had succeeded; her beloved though as yet unseen was coming.  ‘Behold, he standeth behind our wall; he looked forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice,’ she thought ecstatically.  ‘And, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.’<br><br>But it was necessary to consider the details of lodging and feeding him.  This she did most solicitously, and awaited the pregnant day and hour.<br><br>It was about five in the afternoon when she heard a ring at the door and the editor’s brother's voice in the hall.  Poetess as she was, or as she thought herself, she had not been too sublime that day to dress with infinite trouble in a fashionable robe of rich material, having a faint resemblance to the chiton of the Greeks, a style just then in vogue among ladies of an artistic and romantic turn, which had been obtained by Ella of her Bond Street dressmaker when she was last in London.  Her visitor entered the drawing room.  She looked toward his rear; nobody else came through the door.  Where, in the name of the God of Love, was Robert Trewe?<br><br>‘O, I’m sorry,’ said the painter, after their introductory words had been spoken. ‘Trewe is a curious fellow, you know, Mrs. Marchmill.  He said he'd come; then he said he couldn’t.  He's rather dusty.  We've been doing a few miles with knapsacks, you know; and he wanted to get on home.’<br><br>‘He—he's not coming?’<br><br>‘He's not; and he asked me to make his apologies.’<br><br>‘When did you p-p-part from him?’ she asked, her nether lip starting off quivering so much that it was like a tremolo-stop opened in her speech.  She longed to run away from this dreadful bore and cry her eyes out.<br><br>‘Just now, in the turnpike road yonder there.’<br><br>‘What! he has actually gone past my gates?’<br><br>‘Yes.  When we got to them—handsome gates they are, too, the finest bit of modern wrought- iron work I have seen—when we came to them we stopped, talking there a little while, and then he wished me goodbye and went on.  The truth is, he’s a little bit depressed just now, and doesn't want to see anybody.  He's a very good fellow, and a warm friend, but a little uncertain and gloomy sometimes; he thinks too much of things.  His poetry is rather too erotic and passionate, you know, for some tastes; and he has just come in for a terrible slating from the ———— Review that was published yesterday; he saw a copy of it at the station by accident.  Perhaps you've read it?’<br><br>‘No.’<br><br>‘So much the better. O, it is not worth thinking of; just one of those articles written to order, to please the narrow-minded set of subscribers upon whom the circulation depends.  But he's upset by it.  He says it is the misrepresentation that hurts him so; that, though he can stand a fair attack, he can't stand lies that he's powerless to refute and stop from spreading.  That's just Trewe's weak point.  He lives so much by himself that these things affect him much more than they would if he were in the bustle of fashionable or commercial life.  So he wouldn't come here, making the excuse that it all looked so new and monied—if you'll pardon——’<br><br>‘But—he must have known—there was sympathy here!  Has he never said anything about getting letters from this address?’<br><br>‘Yes, yes, he has, from John Ivy—perhaps a relative of yours, he thought, visiting here at the time?’<br><br>‘Did he—like Ivy, did he say?’<br><br>‘Well, I don't know that he took any great interest in Ivy.’<br><br>‘Or in his poems?’<br><br>‘Or in his poems—so far as I know, that is.’<br><br>Robert Trewe took no interest in her house, in her poems, or in their writer.  As soon as she could get away she went into the nursery and tried to let off her emotion by unnecessarily kissing the children, till she had a sudden sense of disgust at being reminded how plain-looking they were, like their father.<br><br>The obtuse and single-minded landscape-painter never once perceived from her conversation that it was only Trewe she wanted, and not himself.  He made the best of his visit, seeming to enjoy the society of Ella's husband, who also took a great fancy to him, and showed him everywhere about the neighborhood, neither of them noticing Ella's mood.<br><br>The painter had been gone only a day or two when, while sitting upstairs alone one morning, she glanced over the London paper just arrived, and read the following paragraph: —<br><br>‘SUICIDE OF A POET’ Mr. Robert Trewe, who has been favorably known for some years as one of our rising lyrists, committed suicide at his lodgings at Solentsea on Saturday evening last by shooting himself in the right temple with a revolver.  Readers hardly need to be reminded that Mr. Trewe recently attracted the attention of a much wider public than had hitherto known him, by his new volume of verse, mostly of an impassioned kind, entitled 'Lyrics to a Woman Unknown,' which has been already favorably noticed in these pages for the extraordinary gamut of feeling it traverses, and which has been made the subject of a severe, if not ferocious, criticism in the ———— Review.  It is supposed, though not certainly known, that the article may have partially conduced to the sad act, as a copy of the review in question was found on his writing-table; and he has been observed to be in a somewhat depressed state of mind since the critique appeared.’<br><br>Then came the report of the inquest, at which the following letter was read, it having been addressed to a friend at a distance: —<br><br>‘Dear ———, Before these lines reach your hands I shall be delivered from the inconveniences of seeing, hearing, and knowing more of the things around me.  I will not trouble you by giving my reasons for the step I have taken, though I can assure you they were sound and logical.  Perhaps had I been blessed with a mother, or a sister, or a female friend of another sort tenderly devoted to me, I might have thought it worth while to continue my present existence.  I have long dreamt of such an unattainable creature, as you know; and she, this undiscoverable, elusive one, inspired my last volume; the imaginary woman alone, for, in spite of what has been said in some quarters, there is no real woman behind the title.  She has continued to the last unrevealed, unmet, unwon.  I think it desirable to mention this in order that no blame may attach to any real woman as having been the cause of my decease by cruel or cavalier treatment of me.  Tell my landlady that I am sorry to have caused her this unpleasantness; but my occupancy of the rooms will soon be forgotten.  There are ample funds in my name at the bank to pay all expenses. R. TREWE.’<br><br>Ella sat for a while as if stunned, then rushed into the adjoining chamber and flung herself upon her face on the bed.<br><br>Her grief and distraction shook her to pieces; and she lay in this frenzy of sorrow for more than an hour.  Broken words came every now and then from her quivering lips: ‘O, if he had only known of me—known of me—me! . . . O, if I had only once met him—only once; and put my hand upon his hot forehead—kissed him—let him know how I loved him—that I would have suffered shame and scorn, would have lived and died, for him!  Perhaps it would have saved his dear life! . . . But no—it was not allowed!  God is a jealous God; and that happiness was not for him and me!’<br><br>All possibilities were over; the meeting was stultified.  Yet it was almost visible to her in her fantasy even now, though it could never be substantiated—<br><br>‘The hour which might have been, yet might not be,<br><br>Which man's and woman's heart conceived and bore,<br><br>Yet whereof life was barren.’<br><br>She wrote to the landlady at Solentsea in the third person, in as subdued a style as she could command, enclosing a postal order for a sovereign, and informing Mrs. Hooper that Mrs. Marchmill had seen in the papers the sad account of the poet's death, and having been, as Mrs. Hooper was aware, much interested in Mr. Trewe during her stay at Coburg House, she would be obliged if Mrs. Hooper could obtain a small portion of his hair before his coffin was closed down, and send it her as a memorial of him, as also the photograph that was in the frame.<br><br>By the return-post a letter arrived containing what had been requested.  Ella wept over the portrait and secured it in her private drawer; the lock of hair she tied with white ribbon and put in her bosom, whence she drew it and kissed it every now and then in some unobserved nook.<br><br>‘What's the matter?’ said her husband, looking up from his newspaper on one of these occasions.  ‘Crying over something?  A lock of hair?  Whose is it?’<br><br>‘He's dead!’ she murmured.<br><br>‘Who?’<br><br>‘I don't want to tell you, Will, just now, unless you insist!’ she said, a sob hanging heavy in her voice.<br><br>‘O, all right.’<br><br>‘Do you mind my refusing?  I will tell you someday.’<br><br>‘It doesn't matter in the least, of course.’<br><br>He walked away whistling a few bars of no tune in particular; and when he had got down to his factory in the city the subject came into Marchmill's head again.<br><br>He, too, was aware that a suicide had taken place recently at the house they had occupied at Solentsea.  Having seen the volume of poems in his wife's hand of late, and heard fragments of the landlady's conversation about Trewe when they were her tenants, he all at once said to himself, ‘Why of course it's he!  How the devil did she get to know him?  What sly animals women are!’<br><br>Then he placidly dismissed the matter, and went on with his daily affairs.  By this time Ella at home had come to a determination.  Mrs. Hooper, in sending the hair and photograph, had informed her of the day of the funeral; and as the morning and noon wore on an overpowering wish to know where they were laying him took possession of the sympathetic woman.  Caring very little now what her husband or any one else might think of her eccentricities, she wrote Marchmill a brief note, stating that she was called away for the afternoon and evening, but would return on the following morning.  This she left on his desk, and having given the same information to the servants, went out of the house on foot.<br><br>When Mr. Marchmill reached home early in the afternoon the servants looked anxious.  The nurse took him privately aside, and hinted that her mistress's sadness during the past few days had been such that she feared she had gone out to drown herself.  Marchmill reflected.  Upon the whole he thought that she had not done that. Without saying whither he was bound he also started off, telling them not to sit up for him.  He drove to the railway-station, and took a ticket for Solentsea.<br><br>It was dark when he reached the place, though he had come by a fast train, and he knew that if his wife had preceded him thither it could only have been by a slower train, arriving not a great while before his own.  The season at Solentsea was now past: the parade was gloomy, and the flys were few and cheap.  He asked the way to the Cemetery, and soon reached it.  The gate was locked, but the keeper let him in, declaring, however, that there was nobody within the precincts.  Although it was not late, the autumnal darkness had now become intense; and he found some difficulty in keeping to the serpentine path which led to the quarter where, as the man had told him, the one or two interments for the day had taken place.  He stepped upon the grass, and, stumbling over some pegs, stooped now and then to discern if possible a figure against the sky.  He could see none; but lighting on a spot where the soil was trodden, beheld a crouching object beside a newly made grave.  She heard him, and sprang up.<br><br>‘Ell, how silly this is!’ he said indignantly.  ‘Running away from home—I never heard such a thing!  Of course I am not jealous of this unfortunate man; but it is too ridiculous that you, a married woman with three children and a fourth coming, should go losing your head like this over a dead lover! . . . Do you know you were locked in?  You might not have been able to get out all night.’<br><br>She did not answer.<br><br>‘I hope it didn't go far between you and him, for your own sake.’<br><br>‘Don't insult me, Will.’<br><br>‘Mind, I won't have anymore of this sort of thing; do you hear?’<br><br>‘Very well,’ she said.<br><br>He drew her arm within his own, and conducted her out of the Cemetery.  It was impossible to get back that night; and not wishing to be recognized in their present sorry condition he took her to a miserable little coffee-house close to the station, whence they departed early in the morning, traveling almost without speaking, under the sense that it was one of those dreary situations occurring in married life which words could not mend, and reaching their own door at noon.<br><br>The months passed, and neither of the twain ever ventured to start a conversation upon this episode.  Ella seemed to be only too frequently in a sad and listless mood, which might almost have been called pining.  The time was approaching when she would have to undergo the stress of childbirth for a fourth time, and that apparently not tend to raise her spirits.<br><br>‘I don't think I shall get over it this time!’ she said one day.  ‘Pooh! what childish foreboding!  Why shouldn't it be as well now as ever?’<br><br>She shook her head.  ‘I feel almost sure I am going to die; and I should be glad, if it were not for Nelly, and Frank, and Tiny.’<br><br>‘And me!’<br><br>‘You'll soon find somebody to fill my place,’ she murmured, with a sad smile. ‘And you'll have a perfect right to; I assure you of that.’<br><br>‘Ell, you are not thinking still about that—poetical friend of yours?’<br><br>She neither admitted nor denied the charge.  ‘I am not going to get over my illness this time,’ she reiterated.  ‘Something tells me I shan't.’<br><br>This view of things was rather a bad beginning, as it usually is; and, in fact, six weeks later, in the month of May, she was lying in her room, pulseless and bloodless, with hardly strength enough left to follow up one feeble breath with another, the infant for whose unnecessary life she was slowly parting with her own being fat and well.  Just before her death she spoke to Marchmill softly: —<br><br>‘Will, I want to confess to you the entire circumstances of that—about you know what—that time we visited Solentsea.  I can't tell what possessed me—how I could forget you so, my husband!  But I had got into a morbid state: I thought you had been unkind; that you had neglected me; that you weren't up to my intellectual level, while he was, and far above it.  I wanted a fuller appreciator, perhaps, rather than another lover—’<br><br>She could get no further then for very exhaustion; and she went off in sudden collapse a few hours later, without having said anything more to her husband on the subject of her love for the poet.  William Marchmill, in truth, like most husbands of several years' standing, was little disturbed by retrospective jealousies, and had not shown the least anxiety to press her for confessions concerning a man dead and gone beyond any power of inconveniencing him more.<br><br>But when she had been buried a couple of years it chanced one day that, in turning over some forgotten papers that he wished to destroy before his second wife entered the house, he lighted on a lock of hair in an envelope, with the photograph of the deceased poet, a date being written on the back in his late wife's hand.  It was that of the time they spent at Solentsea.<br><br>Marchmill looked long and musingly at the hair and portrait, for something struck him.  Fetching the little boy who had been the death of his mother, now a noisy toddler, he took him on his knee, held the lock of hair against the child's head, and set up the photograph on the table behind, so that he could closely compare the features each countenance presented.  By a known but inexplicable trick of Nature there were undoubtedly strong traces of resemblance to the man Ella had never seen; the dreamy and peculiar expression of the poet's face sat, as the transmitted idea,, upon the child's, and the hair was of the same hue.<b><br>‘I'm damned if I didn't think so!’ murmured Marchmill.  ‘Then she did play me false with that fellow at the lodgings!  Let me see: the dates—the second week in August . . . the third week in May. . . . Yes . . . yes. . . . Get away, you poor little brat! You are nothing to me!’</p>"}
