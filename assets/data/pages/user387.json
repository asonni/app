Surry twilight! importunate band!<br> Oh! strongly adorable tennis-girl's hand!<br><br> Around us are Rovers and Austins afar,<br> Above us the intimate roof of the car,<br> And here on my right is the girl of my choice,<br> With the tilt of her nose and the chime of her voice.<br><br> And the scent of her wrap, and the words never said,<br> And the ominous, ominous dancing ahead.<br> We sat in the car park till twenty to one<br> And now I'm engaged to Miss Joan Hunter Dunn."
