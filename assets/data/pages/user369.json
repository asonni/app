Pitched past pitch of grief,<br> More pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring.<br> Comforter, where, where is your comforting?<br> Mary, mother of us, where is your relief?<br> My cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief<br> Woe, world-sorrow; on an age-old anvil wince and sing-;<br> Then lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked 'No ling-<br> ering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief'. <br><br> O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall<br> Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed.
