				"main_text": "They pointed me out on the highway, and they said<br>'That man has a curious way of holding his head.'<br><br>They pointed me out on the beach; they said 'That man<br>Will never become as we are, try as he can.'<br><br>They pointed me out at the station, and the guard<br>Looked at me twice, thrice, thoughtfully & hard.<br><br>I took the same train that the others took,<br>To the same place. Were it not for that look<br>And those words, we were all of us the same.<br>I studied merely maps. I tried to name<br>The effects of motion on the travellers,<br>I watched the couple I could see, the curse<br>And blessings of that couple, their destination,<br>The deception practised on them at the station,<br>Their courage. When the train stopped and they knew<br>The end of their journey, I descended too."
