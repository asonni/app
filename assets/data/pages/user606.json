Belief! And unbelief...<br><br> And, though you tell me I shall die,<br><br> You say not how or when or why.<br><br><br><br> Indifferent the finches sing,<br><br> Unheeding roll the lorries past:<br><br> What misery will this year bring<br><br> Now spring is in the air at last?<br><br> For, sure as blackthorn bursts to snow,<br><br> Cancer in some of us will grow,<br><br> The tasteful crematorium door<br><br> Shuts out for some the furnace roar;<br><br> But church-bells open on the blast<br><br> Our loneliness, so long and vast.",
