At<br> present, so I am told, the high gods of medicine have decreed that the<br> first cries of the young shall be uttered upon the anaesthetic air of<br> a hospital, preferably a fashionable one. So young Mr. and Mrs. Roger<br> Button were fifty years ahead of style when they decided, one day in<br> the summer of 1860, that their first baby should be born in a<br> hospital. Whether this anachronism had any bearing upon the<br> astonishing history I am about to set down will never be known.<br> <br> I shall tell you what occurred, and let you judge for yourself.<br> <br> The Roger Buttons held an enviable position, both social and<br> financial, in Antebellum Baltimore. They were related to the This<br> Family and the That Family, which, as every Southerner knew, entitled<br> them to membership in that enormous peerage which largely populated<br> the Confederacy. This was their first experience with the charming old<br> custom of having babies--Mr. Button was naturally nervous. He hoped it<br> would be a boy so that he could be sent to Yale College in<br> Connecticut, at which institution Mr. Button himself had been known<br> for four years by the somewhat obvious nickname of ‘Cuff.’<br> <br> On the September morning consecrated to the enormous event he arose<br> nervously at six o'clock dressed himself, adjusted an impeccable<br> stock, and hurried forth through the streets of Baltimore to the<br> hospital, to determine whether the darkness of the night had borne in<br> new life upon its bosom.<br> <br> When he was approximately a hundred yards from the Maryland Private<br> Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene, the family<br> physician, descending the front steps, rubbing his hands together with<br> a washing movement--as all doctors are required to do by the unwritten<br> ethics of their profession.<br> <br> Mr. Roger Button, the president of Roger Button & Co., Wholesale<br> Hardware, began to run toward Doctor Keene with much less dignity than<br> was expected from a Southern gentleman of that picturesque period.<br> ‘Doctor Keene!’ he called. ‘Oh, Doctor Keene!’<br> <br> The doctor heard him, faced around, and stood waiting, a curious<br> expression settling on his harsh, medicinal face as Mr. Button drew<br> near.<br> <br> ‘What happened?’ demanded Mr. Button, as he came up in a gasping rush.<br> ‘What was it? How is she’ A boy? Who is it? What---’<br> <br> ‘Talk sense!’ said Doctor Keene sharply, He appeared somewhat<br> irritated.<br> <br> ‘Is the child born?’ begged Mr. Button.<br> <br> Doctor Keene frowned. ‘Why, yes, I suppose so--after a fashion.’ Again<br> he threw a curious glance at Mr. Button.<br> <br> ‘Is my wife all right?’<br> <br> ‘Yes.’<br> <br> ‘Is it a boy or a girl?’<br> <br> ‘Here now!’ cried Doctor Keene in a perfect passion of irritation,’<br> I'll ask you to go and see for yourself. Outrageous!’ He snapped the<br> last word out in almost one syllable, then he turned away muttering:<br> ‘Do you imagine a case like this will help my professional reputation?<br> One more would ruin me--ruin anybody.’<br> <br> ‘What's the matter?’ demanded Mr. Button appalled. ‘Triplets?’<br> <br> ‘No, not triplets!’ answered the doctor cuttingly. ‘What's more, you<br> can go and see for yourself. And get another doctor. I brought you<br> into the world, young man, and I've been physician to your family for<br> forty years, but I'm through with you! I don't want to see you or any<br> of your relatives ever again! Good-bye!’<br> <br> Then he turned sharply, and without another word climbed into his<br> phaeton, which was waiting at the curbstone, and drove severely away.<br> <br> Mr. Button stood there upon the sidewalk, stupefied and trembling from<br> head to foot. What horrible mishap had occurred? He had suddenly lost<br> all desire to go into the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and<br> Gentlemen--it was with the greatest difficulty that, a moment later,<br> he forced himself to mount the steps and enter the front door.<br> <br> A nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque gloom of the hall.<br> Swallowing his shame, Mr. Button approached her.<br> <br> ‘Good-morning,’ she remarked, looking up at him pleasantly.<br> <br> ‘Good-morning. I--I am Mr. Button.’<br> <br> At this a look of utter terror spread itself over girl's face. She<br> rose to her feet and seemed about to fly from the hall, restraining<br> herself only with the most apparent difficulty.<br> <br> ‘I want to see my child,’ said Mr. Button.<br> <br> The nurse gave a little scream. ‘Oh--of course!’ she cried<br> hysterically. ‘Upstairs. Right upstairs. Go--up!’<br> <br> She pointed the direction, and Mr. Button, bathed in cool<br> perspiration, turned falteringly, and began to mount to the second<br> floor. In the upper hall he addressed another nurse who approached<br> him, basin in hand. ‘I'm Mr. Button,’ he managed to articulate. ‘I<br> want to see my----’<br> <br> Clank! The basin clattered to the floor and rolled in the direction of<br> the stairs. Clank! Clank! I began a methodical decent as if sharing in<br> the general terror which this gentleman provoked.<br> <br> ‘I want to see my child!’ Mr. Button almost shrieked. He was on the<br> verge of collapse.<br> <br> Clank! The basin reached the first floor. The nurse regained control<br> of herself, and threw Mr. Button a look of hearty contempt.<br> <br> ‘All right, Mr. Button,’ she agreed in a hushed voice. ‘Very<br> well! But if you knew what a state it's put us all in this<br> morning! It's perfectly outrageous! The hospital will never have<br> a ghost of a reputation after----’<br> <br> ‘Hurry!’ he cried hoarsely. ‘I can't stand this!’<br> <br> ‘Come this way, then, Mr. Button.’<br> <br> He dragged himself after her. At the end of a long hall they reached a<br> room from which proceeded a variety of howls--indeed, a room which, in<br> later parlance, would have been known as the ‘crying-room.’ They<br> entered.<br> <br> ‘Well,’ gasped Mr. Button, ‘which is mine?’<br> <br> ‘There!’ said the nurse.<br> <br> Mr. Button's eyes followed her pointing finger, and this is what he<br> saw. Wrapped in a voluminous white blanket, and partly crammed into<br> one of the cribs, there sat an old man apparently about seventy years<br> of age. His sparse hair was almost white, and from his chin dripped a<br> long smoke-colored beard, which waved absurdly back and forth, fanned<br> by the breeze coming in at the window. He looked up at Mr. Button with<br> dim, faded eyes in which lurked a puzzled question.<br> <br> ‘Am I mad?’ thundered Mr. Button, his terror resolving into rage. ‘Is<br> this some ghastly hospital joke?<br> <br> ‘It doesn't seem like a joke to us,’ replied the nurse severely. ‘And<br> I don't know whether you're mad or not--but that is most certainly<br> your child.’<br> <br> The cool perspiration redoubled on Mr. Button's forehead. He closed<br> his eyes, and then, opening them, looked again. There was no<br> mistake--he was gazing at a man of threescore and ten--a baby<br> of threescore and ten, a baby whose feet hung over the sides of the<br> crib in which it was reposing.<br> <br> The old man looked placidly from one to the other for a moment, and<br> then suddenly spoke in a cracked and ancient voice. ‘Are you my<br> father?’ he demanded.<br> <br> Mr. Button and the nurse started violently.<br> <br> ‘Because if you are,’ went on the old man querulously, ‘I wish you'd<br> get me out of this place--or, at least, get them to put a comfortable<br> rocker in here,’<br> <br> ‘Where in God's name did you come from? Who are you?’ burst out Mr.<br> Button frantically.<br> <br> ‘I can't tell you exactly who I am,’ replied the querulous<br> whine, ‘because I've only been born a few hours--but my last name is<br> certainly Button.’<br> <br> ‘You lie! You're an impostor!’<br> <br> The old man turned wearily to the nurse. ‘Nice way to welcome a<br> new-born child,’ he complained in a weak voice. ‘Tell him he's wrong,<br> why don't you?’<br> <br> ‘You're wrong. Mr. Button,’ said the nurse severely. ‘This is your<br> child, and you'll have to make the best of it. We're going to ask you<br> to take him home with you as soon as possible-some time to-day.’<br> <br> ‘Home?’ repeated Mr. Button incredulously.<br> <br> ‘Yes, we can't have him here. We really can't, you know?’<br> <br> ‘I'm right glad of it,’ whined the old man. ‘This is a fine place to<br> keep a youngster of quiet tastes. With all this yelling and howling, I<br> haven't been able to get a wink of sleep. I asked for something to<br> eat’--here his voice rose to a shrill note of protest--’and they<br> brought me a bottle of milk!’<br> <br> Mr. Button, sank down upon a chair near his son and concealed his face<br> in his hands. ‘My heavens!’ he murmured, in an ecstasy of horror.<br> ‘What will people say? What must I do?’<br> <br> ‘You'll have to take him home,’ insisted the nurse--’immediately!’<br> <br> A grotesque picture formed itself with dreadful clarity before the<br> eyes of the tortured man--a picture of himself walking through the<br> crowded streets of the city with this appalling apparition stalking by<br> his side.<br> <br> ‘I can't. I can't,’ he moaned.<br> <br> People would stop to speak to him, and what was he going to say? He<br> would have to introduce this--this septuagenarian: ‘This is my son,<br> born early this morning.’ And then the old man would gather his<br> blanket around him and they would plod on, past the bustling stores,<br> the slave market--for a dark instant Mr. Button wished passionately<br> that his son was black--past the luxurious houses of the residential<br> district, past the home for the aged....<br> <br> ‘Come! Pull yourself together,’ commanded the nurse.<br> <br> ‘See here,’ the old man announced suddenly, ‘if you think I'm going to<br> walk home in this blanket, you're entirely mistaken.’<br> <br> ‘Babies always have blankets.’<br> <br> With a malicious crackle the old man held up a small white swaddling<br> garment. ‘Look!’ he quavered. ‘This is what they had ready for<br> me.’<br> <br> ‘Babies always wear those,’ said the nurse primly.<br> <br> ‘Well,’ said the old man, ‘this baby's not going to wear anything in<br> about two minutes. This blanket itches. They might at least have given<br> me a sheet.’<br> <br> ‘Keep it on! Keep it on!’ said Mr. Button hurriedly. He turned to the<br> nurse. ‘What'll I do?’<br> <br> ‘Go down town and buy your son some clothes.’<br> <br> Mr. Button's son's voice followed him down into the: hall: ‘And a<br> cane, father. I want to have a cane.’<br> <br> Mr. Button banged the outer door savagely....<br> <br>‘Good-morning,’ Mr. Button said nervously, to the clerk in the<br> Chesapeake Dry Goods Company. ‘I want to buy some clothes for my<br> child.’<br> <br> ‘How old is your child, sir?’<br> <br> ‘About six hours,’ answered Mr. Button, without due consideration.<br> <br> ‘Babies' supply department in the rear.’<br> <br> ‘Why, I don't think--I'm not sure that's what I want. It's--he's an<br> unusually large-size child. Exceptionally--ah large.’<br> <br> ‘They have the largest child's sizes.’<br> <br> ‘Where is the boys' department?’ inquired Mr. Button, shifting his<br> ground desperately. He felt that the clerk must surely scent his<br> shameful secret.<br> <br> ‘Right here.’<br> <br> ‘Well----’ He hesitated. The notion of dressing his son in men's<br> clothes was repugnant to him. If, say, he could only find a very large<br> boy's suit, he might cut off that long and awful beard, dye the white<br> hair brown, and thus manage to conceal the worst, and to retain<br> something of his own self-respect--not to mention his position in<br> Baltimore society.<br> <br> But a frantic inspection of the boys' department revealed no suits to<br> fit the new-born Button. He blamed the store, of course---in such<br> cases it is the thing to blame the store.<br> <br> ‘How old did you say that boy of yours was?’ demanded the clerk<br> curiously.<br> <br> ‘He's--sixteen.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said six hours. You'll<br> find the youths' department in the next aisle.’<br> <br> Mr. Button turned miserably away. Then he stopped, brightened, and<br> pointed his finger toward a dressed dummy in the window display.<br> ‘There!’ he exclaimed. ‘I'll take that suit, out there on the dummy.’<br> <br> The clerk stared. ‘Why,’ he protested, ‘that's not a child's suit. At<br> least it is, but it's for fancy dress. You could wear it<br> yourself!’<br> <br> ‘Wrap it up,’ insisted his customer nervously. ‘That's what I want.’<br> <br> The astonished clerk obeyed.<br> <br> Back at the hospital Mr. Button entered the nursery and almost threw<br> the package at his son. ‘Here's your clothes,’ he snapped out.<br> <br> The old man untied the package and viewed the contents with a<br> quizzical eye.<br> <br> ‘They look sort of funny to me,’ he complained, ‘I don't want to be<br> made a monkey of--’<br> <br> ‘You've made a monkey of me!’ retorted Mr. Button fiercely. ‘Never you<br> mind how funny you look. Put them on--or I'll--or I'll spank<br> you.’ He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate word, feeling<br> nevertheless that it was the proper thing to say.<br> <br> ‘All right, father’--this with a grotesque simulation of filial<br> respect--’you've lived longer; you know best. Just as you say.’<br> <br> As before, the sound of the word ‘father’ caused Mr. Button to start<br> violently.<br> <br> ‘And hurry.’<br> <br> ‘I'm hurrying, father.’<br> <br> When his son was dressed Mr. Button regarded him with depression. The<br> costume consisted of dotted socks, pink pants, and a belted blouse<br> with a wide white collar. Over the latter waved the long whitish<br> beard, drooping almost to the waist. The effect was not good.<br> <br> ‘Wait!’<br> <br> Mr. Button seized a hospital shears and with three quick snaps<br> amputated a large section of the beard. But even with this improvement<br> the ensemble fell far short of perfection. The remaining brush of<br> scraggly hair, the watery eyes, the ancient teeth, seemed oddly out of<br> tone with the gaiety of the costume. Mr. Button, however, was<br> obdurate--he held out his hand. ‘Come along!’ he said sternly.<br> <br> His son took the hand trustingly. ‘What are you going to call me,<br> dad?’ he quavered as they walked from the nursery--’just 'baby' for a<br> while? till you think of a better name?’<br> <br> Mr. Button grunted. ‘I don't know,’ he answered harshly. ‘I think<br> we'll call you Methuselah.’<br> <br>Even after the new addition to the Button family had had his hair cut<br> short and then dyed to a sparse unnatural black, had had his face<br> shaved so dose that it glistened, and had been attired in small-boy<br> clothes made to order by a flabbergasted tailor, it was impossible for<br> Button to ignore the fact that his son was a excuse for a first family<br> baby. Despite his aged stoop, Benjamin Button--for it was by this name<br> they called him instead of by the appropriate but invidious<br> Methuselah--was five feet eight inches tall. His clothes did not<br> conceal this, nor did the clipping and dyeing of his eyebrows disguise<br> the fact that the eyes under--were faded and watery and tired. In<br> fact, the baby-nurse who had been engaged in advance left the house<br> after one look, in a state of considerable indignation.<br> <br> But Mr. Button persisted in his unwavering purpose. Benjamin was a<br> baby, and a baby he should remain. At first he declared that if<br> Benjamin didn't like warm milk he could go without food altogether,<br> but he was finally prevailed upon to allow his son bread and butter,<br> and even oatmeal by way of a compromise. One day he brought home a<br> rattle and, giving it to Benjamin, insisted in no uncertain terms that<br> he should ‘play with it,’ whereupon the old man took it with--a weary<br> expression and could be heard jingling it obediently at intervals<br> throughout the day.<br> <br> There can be no doubt, though, that the rattle bored him, and that he<br> found other and more soothing amusements when he was left alone. For<br> instance, Mr. Button discovered one day that during the preceding week<br> be had smoked more cigars than ever before--a phenomenon, which was<br> explained a few days later when, entering the nursery unexpectedly, he<br> found the room full of faint blue haze and Benjamin, with a guilty<br> expression on his face, trying to conceal the butt of a dark Havana.<br> This, of course, called for a severe spanking, but Mr. Button found<br> that he could not bring himself to administer it. He merely warned his<br> son that he would ‘stunt his growth.’<br> <br> Nevertheless he persisted in his attitude. He brought home lead<br> soldiers, he brought toy trains, he brought large pleasant animals<br> made of cotton, and, to perfect the illusion which he was<br> creating--for himself at least--he passionately demanded of the clerk<br> in the toy-store whether ‘the paint would come oft the pink duck if<br> the baby put it in his mouth.’ But, despite all his father's efforts,<br> Benjamin refused to be interested. He would steal down the back stairs<br> and return to the nursery with a volume of the Encyclopedia<br> Britannica, over which he would pore through an afternoon, while his<br> cotton cows and his Noah's ark were left neglected on the floor.<br> Against such a stubbornness Mr. Button's efforts were of little avail.<br> <br> The sensation created in Baltimore was, at first, prodigious. What the<br> mishap would have cost the Buttons and their kinsfolk socially cannot<br> be determined, for the outbreak of the Civil War drew the city's<br> attention to other things. A few people who were unfailingly polite<br> racked their brains for compliments to give to the parents--and<br> finally hit upon the ingenious device of declaring that the baby<br> resembled his grandfather, a fact which, due to the standard state of<br> decay common to all men of seventy, could not be denied. Mr. and Mrs.<br> Roger Button were not pleased, and Benjamin's grandfather was<br> furiously insulted.<br> <br> Benjamin, once he left the hospital, took life as he found it. Several<br> small boys were brought to see him, and he spent a stiff-jointed<br> afternoon trying to work up an interest in tops and marbles--he even<br> managed, quite accidentally, to break a kitchen window with a stone<br> from a sling shot, a feat which secretly delighted his father.<br> <br> Thereafter Benjamin contrived to break something every day, but he did<br> these things only because they were expected of him, and because he<br> was by nature obliging.<br> <br> When his grandfather's initial antagonism wore off, Benjamin and that<br> gentleman took enormous pleasure in one another's company. They would<br> sit for hours, these two, so far apart in age and experience, and,<br> like old cronies, discuss with tireless monotony the slow events of<br> the day. Benjamin felt more at ease in his grandfather's presence than<br> in his parents'--they seemed always somewhat in awe of him and,<br> despite the dictatorial authority they exercised over him, frequently<br> addressed him as ‘Mr.’<br> <br> He was as puzzled as any one else at the apparently advanced age of<br> his mind and body at birth. He read up on it in the medical journal,<br> but found that no such case had been previously recorded. At his<br> father's urging he made an honest attempt to play with other boys, and<br> frequently he joined in the milder games--football shook him up too<br> much, and he feared that in case of a fracture his ancient bones would<br> refuse to knit.<br> <br> When he was five he was sent to kindergarten, where he initiated into<br> the art of pasting green paper on orange paper, of weaving colored<br> maps and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces. He was inclined to<br> drowse off to sleep in the middle of these tasks, a habit which both<br> irritated and frightened his young teacher. To his relief she<br> complained to his parents, and he was removed from the school. The<br> Roger Buttons told their friends that they felt he was too young.<br> <br> By the time he was twelve years old his parents had grown used to him.<br> Indeed, so strong is the force of custom that they no longer felt that<br> he was different from any other child--except when some curious<br> anomaly reminded them of the fact. But one day a few weeks after his<br> twelfth birthday, while looking in the mirror, Benjamin made, or<br> thought he made, an astonishing discovery. Did his eyes deceive him,<br> or had his hair turned in the dozen years of his life from white to<br> iron-gray under its concealing dye? Was the network of wrinkles on his<br> face becoming less pronounced? Was his skin healthier and firmer, with<br> even a touch of ruddy winter color? He could not tell. He knew that<br> he no longer stooped, and that his physical condition had improved<br> since the early days of his life.<br> <br> ‘Can it be----?’ he thought to himself, or, rather, scarcely dared to<br> think.<br> <br> He went to his father. ‘I am grown,’ he announced determinedly. ‘I<br> want to put on long trousers.’<br> <br> His father hesitated. ‘Well,’ he said finally, ‘I don't know. Fourteen<br> is the age for putting on long trousers--and you are only twelve.’<br> <br> ‘But you'll have to admit,’ protested Benjamin, ‘that I'm big for my<br> age.’<br> <br> His father looked at him with illusory speculation. ‘Oh, I'm not so<br> sure of that,’ he said. ‘I was as big as you when I was twelve.’<br> <br> This was not true-it was all part of Roger Button's silent agreement<br> with himself to believe in his son's normality.<br> <br> Finally a compromise was reached. Benjamin was to continue to dye his<br> hair. He was to make a better attempt to play with boys of his own<br> age. He was not to wear his spectacles or carry a cane in the street.<br> In return for these concessions he was allowed his first suit of long<br> trousers....<br> <br>Of the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth and twenty-first<br> year I intend to say little. Suffice to record that they were years of<br> normal ungrowth. When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man of<br> fifty; he had more hair and it was of a dark gray; his step was firm,<br> his voice had lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy<br> baritone. So his father sent him up to Connecticut to take<br> examinations for entrance to Yale College. Benjamin passed his<br> examination and became a member of the freshman class.<br> <br> On the third day following his matriculation he received a<br> notification from Mr. Hart, the college registrar, to call at his<br> office and arrange his schedule. Benjamin, glancing in the mirror,<br> decided that his hair needed a new application of its brown dye, but<br> an anxious inspection of his bureau drawer disclosed that the dye<br> bottle was not there. Then he remembered--he had emptied it the day<br> before and thrown it away.<br> <br> He was in a dilemma. He was due at the registrar's in five minutes.<br> There seemed to be no help for it--he must go as he was. He did.<br> <br> ‘Good-morning,’ said the registrar politely. ‘You've come to inquire<br> about your son.’<br> <br> ‘Why, as a matter of fact, my name's Button----’ began Benjamin, but<br> Mr. Hart cut him off.<br> <br> ‘I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Button. I'm expecting your son here<br> any minute.’<br> <br> ‘That's me!’ burst out Benjamin. ‘I'm a freshman.’<br> <br> ‘What!’<br> <br> ‘I'm a freshman.’<br> <br> ‘Surely you're joking.’<br> <br> ‘Not at all.’<br> <br> The registrar frowned and glanced at a card before him. ‘Why, I have<br> Mr. Benjamin Button's age down here as eighteen.’<br> <br> ‘That's my age,’ asserted Benjamin, flushing slightly.<br> <br> The registrar eyed him wearily. ‘Now surely, Mr. Button, you don't<br> expect me to believe that.’<br> <br> Benjamin smiled wearily. ‘I am eighteen,’ he repeated.<br> <br> The registrar pointed sternly to the door. ‘Get out,’ he said. ‘Get<br> out of college and get out of town. You are a dangerous lunatic.’<br> <br> ‘I am eighteen.’<br> <br> Mr. Hart opened the door. ‘The idea!’ he shouted. ‘A man of your age<br> trying to enter here as a freshman. Eighteen years old, are you? Well,<br> I'll give you eighteen minutes to get out of town.’<br> <br> Benjamin Button walked with dignity from the room, and half a dozen<br> undergraduates, who were waiting in the hall, followed him curiously<br> with their eyes. When he had gone a little way he turned around, faced<br> the infuriated registrar, who was still standing in the door-way, and<br> repeated in a firm voice: ‘I am eighteen years old.’<br> <br> To a chorus of titters which went up from the group of undergraduates,<br> Benjamin walked away.<br> <br> But he was not fated to escape so easily. On his melancholy walk to<br> the railroad station he found that he was being followed by a group,<br> then by a swarm, and finally by a dense mass of undergraduates. The<br> word had gone around that a lunatic had passed the entrance<br> examinations for Yale and attempted to palm himself off as a youth of<br> eighteen. A fever of excitement permeated the college. Men ran hatless<br> out of classes, the football team abandoned its practice and joined<br> the mob, professors' wives with bonnets awry and bustles out of<br> position, ran shouting after the procession, from which proceeded a<br> continual succession of remarks aimed at the tender sensibilities of<br> Benjamin Button.<br> <br> ‘He must be the wandering Jew!’<br> <br> ‘He ought to go to prep school at his age!’<br> <br> ‘Look at the infant prodigy!’ ‘He thought this was the old men's<br> home.’<br> <br> ‘Go up to Harvard!’<br> <br> Benjamin increased his gait, and soon he was running. He would show<br> them! He would go to Harvard, and then they would regret these<br> ill-considered taunts!<br> <br> Safely on board the train for Baltimore, he put his head from the<br> window. ‘You'll regret this!’ he shouted.<br> <br> ‘Ha-ha!’ the undergraduates laughed. ‘Ha-ha-ha!’ It was the biggest<br> mistake that Yale College had ever made....<br> <br>In 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old, and he signalized his<br> birthday by going to work for his father in Roger Button & Co.,<br> Wholesale Hardware. It was in that same year that he began ‘going out<br> socially’--that is, his father insisted on taking him to several<br> fashionable dances. Roger Button was now fifty, and he and his son<br> were more and more companionable--in fact, since Benjamin had ceased<br> to dye his hair (which was still grayish) they appeared about the same<br> age, and could have passed for brothers.<br> <br> One night in August they got into the phaeton attired in their<br> full-dress suits and drove out to a dance at the Shevlins' country<br> house, situated just outside of Baltimore. It was a gorgeous evening.<br> A full moon drenched the road to the lusterless color of platinum,<br> and late-blooming harvest flowers breathed into the motionless air<br> aromas that were like low, half-heard laughter. The open country,<br> carpeted for rods around with bright wheat, was translucent as in the<br> day. It was almost impossible not to be affected by the sheer beauty<br> of the sky--almost.<br> <br> ‘There's a great future in the dry-goods business,’ Roger Button was<br> saying. He was not a spiritual man--his aesthetic sense was<br> rudimentary.<br> <br> ‘Old fellows like me can't learn new tricks,’ he observed profoundly.<br> ‘It's you youngsters with energy and vitality that have the great<br> future before you.’<br> <br> Far up the road the lights of the Shevlins' country house drifted into<br> view, and presently there was a sighing sound that crept persistently<br> toward them--it might have been the fine plaint of violins or the<br> rustle of the silver wheat under the moon.<br> <br> They pulled up behind a handsome brougham whose passengers were<br> disembarking at the door. A lady got out, then an elderly gentleman,<br> then another young lady, beautiful as sin. Benjamin started; an almost<br> chemical change seemed to dissolve and recompose the very elements of<br> his body. A rigor passed over him, blood rose into his cheeks, his<br> forehead, and there was a steady thumping in his ears. It was first<br> love.<br> <br> The girl was slender and frail, with hair that was ashen under the<br> moon and honey-colored under the sputtering gas-lamps of the porch.<br> Over her shoulders was thrown a Spanish mantilla of softest yellow,<br> butterflied in black; her feet were glittering buttons at the hem of<br> her bustled dress.<br> <br> Roger Button leaned over to his son. ‘That,’ he said, ‘is young<br> Hildegarde Moncrief, the daughter of General Moncrief.’<br> <br> Benjamin nodded coldly. ‘Pretty little thing,’ he said indifferently.<br> But when the Negro boy had led the buggy away, he added: ‘Dad, you<br> might introduce me to her.’<br> <br> They approached a group, of which Miss Moncrief was the center. Reared<br> in the old tradition, she curtsied low before Benjamin. Yes, he might<br> have a dance. He thanked her and walked away--staggered away.<br> <br> The interval until the time for his turn should arrive dragged itself<br> out interminably. He stood close to the wall, silent, inscrutable,<br> watching with murderous eyes the young bloods of Baltimore as they<br> eddied around Hildegarde Moncrief, passionate admiration in their<br> faces. How obnoxious they seemed to Benjamin; how intolerably rosy!<br> Their curling brown whiskers aroused in him a feeling equivalent to<br> indigestion.<br> <br> But when his own time came, and he drifted with her out upon the<br> changing floor to the music of the latest waltz from Paris, his<br> jealousies and anxieties melted from him like a mantle of snow. Blind<br> with enchantment, he felt that life was just beginning.<br> <br> ‘You and your brother got here just as we did, didn't you?’ asked<br> Hildegarde, looking up at him with eyes that were like bright blue<br> enamel.<br> <br> Benjamin hesitated. If she took him for his father's brother, would it<br> be best to enlighten her? He remembered his experience at Yale, so he<br> decided against it. It would be rude to contradict a lady; it would be<br> criminal to mar this exquisite occasion with the grotesque story of<br> his origin. Later, perhaps. So he nodded, smiled, listened, was happy.<br> <br> ‘I like men of your age,’ Hildegarde told him. ‘Young boys are so<br> idiotic. They tell me how much champagne they drink at college, and<br> how much money they lose playing cards. Men of your age know how to<br> appreciate women.’<br> <br> Benjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal--with an effort he<br> choked back the impulse. ‘You're just the romantic age,’ she<br> continued--’fifty. Twenty-five is too wordly-wise; thirty is apt to be<br> pale from overwork; forty is the age of long stories that take a whole<br> cigar to tell; sixty is--oh, sixty is too near seventy; but fifty is<br> the mellow age. I love fifty.’<br> <br> Fifty seemed to Benjamin a glorious age. He longed passionately to be<br> fifty.<br> <br> ‘I've always said,’ went on Hildegarde, ‘that I'd rather marry a man<br> of fifty and be taken care of than many a man of thirty and take care<br> of him.’<br> <br> For Benjamin the rest of the evening was bathed in a honey-colored<br> mist. Hildegarde gave him two more dances, and they discovered that<br> they were marvelously in accord on all the questions of the day. She<br> was to go driving with him on the following Sunday, and then they<br> would discuss all these questions further.<br> <br> Going home in the phaeton just before the crack of dawn, when the<br> first bees were humming and the fading moon glimmered in the cool dew,<br> Benjamin knew vaguely that his father was discussing wholesale<br> hardware.<br> <br> ‘.... And what do you think should merit our biggest attention after<br> hammers and nails?’ the elder Button was saying.<br> <br> ‘Love,’ replied Benjamin absent-mindedly.<br> <br> ‘Lugs?’ exclaimed Roger Button, ‘Why, I've just covered the question<br> of lugs.’<br> <br> Benjamin regarded him with dazed eyes just as the eastern sky was<br> suddenly cracked with light, and an oriole yawned piercingly in the<br> quickening trees...<br> <br>When, six months later, the engagement of Miss Hildegarde Moncrief to<br> Mr. Benjamin Button was made known (I say ‘made known,’ for General<br> Moncrief declared he would rather fall upon his sword than announce<br> it), the excitement in Baltimore society reached a feverish pitch. The<br> almost forgotten story of Benjamin's birth was remembered and sent out<br> upon the winds of scandal in picaresque and incredible forms. It was<br> said that Benjamin was really the father of Roger Button, that he was<br> his brother who had been in prison for forty years, that he was John<br> Wilkes Booth in disguise--and, finally, that he had two small conical<br> horns sprouting from his head.<br> <br> The Sunday supplements of the New York papers played up the case with<br> fascinating sketches which showed the head of Benjamin Button attached<br> to a fish, to a snake, and, finally, to a body of solid brass. He<br> became known, journalistically, as the Mystery Man of Maryland. But<br> the true story, as is usually the case, had a very small circulation.<br> <br> However, every one agreed with General Moncrief that it was ‘criminal’<br> for a lovely girl who could have married any beau in Baltimore to<br> throw herself into the arms of a man who was assuredly fifty. In vain<br> Mr. Roger Button published Us son's birth certificate in large type in<br> the Baltimore Blaze. No one believed it. You had only to look<br> at Benjamin and see.<br> <br> On the part of the two people most concerned there was no wavering. So<br> many of the stories about her fiance were false that Hildegarde<br> refused stubbornly to believe even the true one. In vain General<br> Moncrief pointed out to her the high mortality among men of fifty--or,<br> at least, among men who looked fifty; in vain he told her of the<br> instability of the wholesale hardware business. Hildegarde had chosen<br> to marry for mellowness, and marry she did....<br> <br> In one particular, at least, the friends of Hildegarde Moncrief were<br> mistaken. The wholesale hardware business prospered amazingly. In the<br> fifteen years between Benjamin Button's marriage in 1880 and his<br> father's retirement in 1895, the family fortune was doubled--and this<br> was due largely to the younger member of the firm.<br> <br> Needless to say, Baltimore eventually received the couple to its<br> bosom. Even old General Moncrief became reconciled to his son-in-law<br> when Benjamin gave him the money to bring out his History of the<br> Civil War in twenty volumes, which had been refused by nine<br> prominent publishers.<br> <br> In Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought many changes. It seemed<br> to him that the blood flowed with new vigor through his veins. It<br> began to be a pleasure to rise in the morning, to walk with an active<br> step along the busy, sunny street, to work untiringly with his<br> shipments of hammers and his cargoes of nails. It was in 1890 that he<br> executed his famous business coup: he brought up the suggestion that<br> all nails used in nailing up the boxes in which nails are shipped<br> are the property of the shippee, a proposal which became a<br> statute, was approved by Chief Justice Fossile, and saved Roger Button<br> and Company, Wholesale Hardware, more than six hundred nails every<br> year.<br> <br> In addition, Benjamin discovered that he was becoming more and more<br> attracted by the gay side of life. It was typical of his growing<br> enthusiasm for pleasure that he was the first man in the city of<br> Baltimore to own and run an automobile. Meeting him on the street, his<br> contemporaries would stare enviously at the picture he made of health<br> and vitality.<br> <br> ‘He seems to grow younger every year,’ they would remark. And if old<br> Roger Button, now sixty-five years old, had failed at first to give a<br> proper welcome to his son he atoned at last by bestowing on him what<br> amounted to adulation.<br> <br> And here we come to an unpleasant subject which it will be well to<br> pass over as quickly as possible. There was only one thing that<br> worried Benjamin Button; his wife had ceased to attract him.<br> <br> At that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirty-five, with a son,<br> Roscoe, fourteen years old. In the early days of their marriage<br> Benjamin had worshipped her. But, as the years passed, her<br> honey-colored hair became an unexciting brown, the blue enamel of her<br> eyes assumed the aspect of cheap crockery--moreover, and, most of all,<br> she had become too settled in her ways, too placid, too content, too<br> anaemic in her excitements, and too sober in her taste. As a bride it<br> been she who had ‘dragged’ Benjamin to dances and dinners--now<br> conditions were reversed. She went out socially with him, but without<br> enthusiasm, devoured already by that eternal inertia which comes to<br> live with each of us one day and stays with us to the end.<br> <br> Benjamin's discontent waxed stronger. At the outbreak of the<br> Spanish-American War in 1898 his home had for him so little charm that<br> he decided to join the army. With his business influence he obtained a<br> commission as captain, and proved so adaptable to the work that he was<br> made a major, and finally a lieutenant-colonel just in time to<br> participate in the celebrated charge up San Juan Hill. He was slightly<br> wounded, and received a medal.<br> <br> Benjamin had become so attached to the activity and excitement of<br> array life that he regretted to give it up, but his business required<br> attention, so he resigned his commission and came home. He was met at<br> the station by a brass band and escorted to his house.<br> <br>Hildegarde, waving a large silk flag, greeted him on the porch, and<br> even as he kissed her he felt with a sinking of the heart that these<br> three years had taken their toll. She was a woman of forty now, with a<br> faint skirmish line of gray hairs in her head. The sight depressed<br> him.<br> <br> Up in his room he saw his reflection in the familiar mirror--he went<br> closer and examined his own face with anxiety, comparing it after a<br> moment with a photograph of himself in uniform taken just before the<br> war.<br> <br> ‘Good Lord!’ he said aloud. The process was continuing. There was no<br> doubt of it--he looked now like a man of thirty. Instead of being<br> delighted, he was uneasy--he was growing younger. He had hitherto<br> hoped that once he reached a bodily age equivalent to his age in<br> years, the grotesque phenomenon which had marked his birth would cease<br> to function. He shuddered. His destiny seemed to him awful,<br> incredible.<br> <br> When he came downstairs Hildegarde was waiting for him. She appeared<br> annoyed, and he wondered if she had at last discovered that there was<br> something amiss. It was with an effort to relieve the tension between<br> them that he broached the matter at dinner in what he considered a<br> delicate way.<br> <br> ‘Well,’ he remarked lightly, ‘everybody says I look younger than<br> ever.’<br> <br> Hildegarde regarded him with scorn. She sniffed. ‘Do you think it's<br> anything to boast about?’<br> <br> ‘I'm not boasting,’ he asserted uncomfortably. She sniffed again. ‘The<br> idea,’ she said, and after a moment: ‘I should think you'd have enough<br> pride to stop it.’<br> <br> ‘How can I?’ he demanded.<br> <br> ‘I'm not going to argue with you,’ she retorted. ‘But there's a right<br> way of doing things and a wrong way. If you've made up your mind to be<br> different from everybody else, I don't suppose I can stop you, but I<br> really don't think it's very considerate.’<br> <br> ‘But, Hildegarde, I can't help it.’<br> <br> ‘You can too. You're simply stubborn. You think you don't want to be<br> like any one else. You always have been that way, and you always will<br> be. But just think how it would be if every one else looked at things<br> as you do--what would the world be like?’<br> <br> As this was an inane and unanswerable argument Benjamin made no reply,<br> and from that time on a chasm began to widen between them. He wondered<br> what possible fascination she had ever exercised over him.<br> <br> To add to the breach, he found, as the new century gathered headway,<br> that his thirst for gaiety grew stronger. Never a party of any kind in<br> the city of Baltimore but he was there, dancing with the prettiest of<br> the young married women, chatting with the most popular of the<br> debutantes, and finding their company charming, while his wife, a<br> dowager of evil omen, sat among the chaperons, now in haughty<br> disapproval, and now following him with solemn, puzzled, and<br> reproachful eyes.<br> <br> ‘Look!’ people would remark. ‘What a pity! A young fellow that age<br> tied to a woman of forty-five. He must be twenty years younger than<br> his wife.’ They had forgotten--as people inevitably forget--that back<br> in 1880 their mammas and papas had also remarked about this same<br> ill-matched pair.<br> <br> Benjamin's growing unhappiness at home was compensated for by his many<br> new interests. He took up golf and made a great success of it. He went<br> in for dancing: in 1906 he was an expert at ‘The Boston,’ and in 1908<br> he was considered proficient at the ‘Maxine,’ while in 1909 his<br> ‘Castle Walk’ was the envy of every young man in town.<br> <br> His social activities, of course, interfered to some extent with his<br> business, but then he had worked hard at wholesale hardware for<br> twenty-five years and felt that he could soon hand it on to his son,<br> Roscoe, who had recently graduated from Harvard.<br> <br> He and his son were, in fact, often mistaken for each other. This<br> pleased Benjamin--he soon forgot the insidious fear which had come<br> over him on his return from the Spanish-American War, and grew to take<br> a naive pleasure in his appearance. There was only one fly in the<br> delicious ointment--he hated to appear in public with his wife.<br> Hildegarde was almost fifty, and the sight of her made him feel<br> absurd....<br> <br>One September day in 1910--a few years after Roger Button & Co.,<br> Wholesale Hardware, had been handed over to young Roscoe Button--a<br> man, apparently about twenty years old, entered himself as a freshman<br> at Harvard University in Cambridge. He did not make the mistake of<br> announcing that he would never see fifty again, nor did he mention the<br> fact that his son had been graduated from the same institution ten<br> years before.<br> <br> He was admitted, and almost immediately attained a prominent position<br> in the class, partly because he seemed a little older than the other<br> freshmen, whose average age was about eighteen.<br> <br> But his success was largely due to the fact that in the football game<br> with Yale he played so brilliantly, with so much dash and with such a<br> cold, remorseless anger that he scored seven touchdowns and fourteen<br> field goals for Harvard, and caused one entire eleven of Yale men to<br> be carried singly from the field, unconscious. He was the most<br> celebrated man in college.<br> <br> Strange to say, in his third or junior year he was scarcely able to<br> ‘make’ the team. The coaches said that he had lost weight, and it<br> seemed to the more observant among them that he was not quite as tall<br> as before. He made no touchdowns--indeed, he was retained on the team<br> chiefly in hope that his enormous reputation would bring terror and<br> disorganization to the Yale team.<br> <br> In his senior year he did not make the team at all. He had grown so<br> slight and frail that one day he was taken by some sophomores for a<br> freshman, an incident which humiliated him terribly. He became known<br> as something of a prodigy--a senior who was surely no more than<br> sixteen--and he was often shocked at the worldliness of some of his<br> classmates. His studies seemed harder to him--he felt that they were<br> too advanced. He had heard his classmates speak of St. Midas's, the<br> famous preparatory school, at which so many of them had prepared for<br> college, and he determined after his graduation to enter himself at<br> St. Midas's, where the sheltered life among boys his own size would be<br> more congenial to him.<br> <br> Upon his graduation in 1914 he went home to Baltimore with his Harvard<br> diploma in his pocket. Hildegarde was now residing in Italy, so<br> Benjamin went to live with his son, Roscoe. But though he was welcomed<br> in a general way there was obviously no heartiness in Roscoe's feeling<br> toward him--there was even perceptible a tendency on his son's part to<br> think that Benjamin, as he moped about the house in adolescent<br> mooniness, was somewhat in the way. Roscoe was married now and<br> prominent in Baltimore life, and he wanted no scandal to creep out in<br> connection with his family.<br> <br> Benjamin, no longer persona grata with the debutantes and<br> younger college set, found himself left much done, except for the<br> companionship of three or four fifteen-year-old boys in the<br> neighborhood. His idea of going to St. Midas's school recurred to<br> him.<br> <br> ‘Say,’ he said to Roscoe one day, ‘I've told you over and over that I<br> want to go to prep, school.’<br> <br> ‘Well, go, then,’ replied Roscoe shortly. The matter was distasteful<br> to him, and he wished to avoid a discussion.<br> <br> ‘I can't go alone,’ said Benjamin helplessly. ‘You'll have to enter me<br> and take me up there.’<br> <br> ‘I haven't got time,’ declared Roscoe abruptly. His eyes narrowed and<br> he looked uneasily at his father. ‘As a matter of fact,’ he added,<br> ‘you'd better not go on with this business much longer. You better<br> pull up short. You better--you better’--he paused and his face<br> crimsoned as he sought for words--’you better turn right around and<br> start back the other way. This has gone too far to be a joke. It isn't<br> funny any longer. You--you behave yourself!’<br> <br> Benjamin looked at him, on the verge of tears.<br> <br> ‘And another thing,’ continued Roscoe, ‘when visitors are in the house<br> I want you to call me 'Uncle'--not 'Roscoe,' but 'Uncle,' do you<br> understand? It looks absurd for a boy of fifteen to call me by my<br> first name. Perhaps you'd better call me 'Uncle' all the time,<br> so you'll get used to it.’<br> <br> With a harsh look at his father, Roscoe turned away....<br><br>At the termination of this interview, Benjamin wandered dismally<br> upstairs and stared at himself in the mirror. He had not shaved for<br> three months, but he could find nothing on his face but a faint white<br> down with which it seemed unnecessary to meddle. When he had first<br> come home from Harvard, Roscoe had approached him with the proposition<br> that he should wear eye-glasses and imitation whiskers glued to his<br> cheeks, and it had seemed for a moment that the farce of his early<br> years was to be repeated. But whiskers had itched and made him<br> ashamed. He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented.<br> <br> Benjamin opened a book of boys' stories, The Boy Scouts in Bimini<br> Bay, and began to read. But he found himself thinking persistently<br> about the war. America had joined the Allied cause during the<br> preceding month, and Benjamin wanted to enlist, but, alas, sixteen was<br> the minimum age, and he did not look that old. His true age, which was<br> fifty-seven, would have disqualified him, anyway.<br> <br> There was a knock at his door, and the butler appeared with a letter<br> bearing a large official legend in the corner and addressed to Mr.<br> Benjamin Button. Benjamin tore it open eagerly, and read the enclosure<br> with delight. It informed him that many reserve officers who had<br> served in the Spanish-American War were being called back into service<br> with a higher rank, and it enclosed his commission as brigadier-general<br> in the United States army with orders to report immediately.<br> <br> Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with enthusiasm. This was<br> what he had wanted. He seized his cap, and ten minutes later he had<br> entered a large tailoring establishment on Charles Street, and asked<br> in his uncertain treble to be measured for a uniform.<br> <br> ‘Want to play soldier, sonny?’ demanded a clerk casually.<br> <br> Benjamin flushed. ‘Say! Never mind what I want!’ he retorted angrily.<br> ‘My name's Button and I live on Mt. Vernon Place, so you know I'm good<br> for it.’<br> <br> ‘Well,’ admitted the clerk hesitantly, ‘if you're not, I guess your<br> daddy is, all right.’<br> <br> Benjamin was measured, and a week later his uniform was completed. He<br> had difficulty in obtaining the proper general's insignia because the<br> dealer kept insisting to Benjamin that a nice V.W.C.A. badge would<br> look just as well and be much more fun to play with.<br> <br> Saying nothing to Roscoe, he left the house one night and proceeded by<br> train to Camp Mosby, in South Carolina, where he was to command an<br> infantry brigade. On a sultry April day he approached the entrance to<br> the camp, paid off the taxicab which had brought him from the station,<br> and turned to the sentry on guard.<br> <br> ‘Get some one to handle my luggage!’ he said briskly.<br> <br> The sentry eyed him reproachfully. ‘Say,’ he remarked, ‘where you<br> goin' with the general's duds, sonny?’<br> <br> Benjamin, veteran of the Spanish-American War, whirled upon him with<br> fire in his eye, but with, alas, a changing treble voice.<br> <br> ‘Come to attention!’ he tried to thunder; he paused for breath--then<br> suddenly he saw the sentry snap his heels together and bring his rifle<br> to the present. Benjamin concealed a smile of gratification, but when<br> he glanced around his smile faded. It was not he who had inspired<br> obedience, but an imposing artillery colonel who was approaching on<br> horseback.<br> <br> ‘Colonel!’ called Benjamin shrilly.<br> <br> The colonel came up, drew rein, and looked coolly down at him with a<br> twinkle in his eyes. ‘Whose little boy are you?’ he demanded kindly.<br> <br> ‘I'll soon darn well show you whose little boy I am!’ retorted<br> Benjamin in a ferocious voice. ‘Get down off that horse!’<br> <br> The colonel roared with laughter.<br> <br> ‘You want him, eh, general?’<br> <br> ‘Here!’ cried Benjamin desperately. ‘Read this.’ And he thrust his<br> commission toward the colonel. The colonel read it, his eyes popping<br> from their sockets. ‘Where'd you get this?’ he demanded, slipping the<br> document into his own pocket. ‘I got it from the Government, as you'll<br> soon find out!’ ‘You come along with me,’ said the colonel with a<br> peculiar look. ‘We'll go up to headquarters and talk this over. Come<br> along.’ The colonel turned and began walking his horse in the<br> direction of headquarters. There was nothing for Benjamin to do but<br> follow with as much dignity as possible--meanwhile promising himself a<br> stern revenge. But this revenge did not materialize. Two days later,<br> however, his son Roscoe materialized from Baltimore, hot and cross<br> from a hasty trip, and escorted the weeping general, sans<br> uniform, back to his home.<br> <br> In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born. During the attendant<br> festivities, however, no one thought it ‘the thing’ to mention, that<br> the little grubby boy, apparently about ten years of age who played<br> around the house with lead soldiers and a miniature circus, was the<br> new baby's own grandfather.<br> <br> No one disliked the little boy whose fresh, cheerful face was crossed<br> with just a hint of sadness, but to Roscoe Button his presence was a<br> source of torment. In the idiom of his generation Roscoe did not<br> consider the matter ‘efficient.’ It seemed to him that his father, in<br> refusing to look sixty, had not behaved like a ‘red-blooded<br> he-man’--this was Roscoe's favorite expression--but in a curious and<br> perverse manner. Indeed, to think about the matter for as much as a<br> half an hour drove him to the edge of insanity. Roscoe believed that<br> ‘live wires’ should keep young, but carrying it out on such a scale<br> was--was--was inefficient. And there Roscoe rested.<br> <br> Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown old enough to play<br> childish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of the same<br> nurse. Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day, and<br> Benjamin found that playing with little strips of colored paper,<br> making mats and chains and curious and beautiful designs, was the most<br> fascinating game in the world. Once he was bad and had to stand in the<br> corner--then he cried--but for the most part there were gay hours in<br> the cheerful room, with the sunlight coming in the windows and Miss<br> Bailey's kind hand resting for a moment now and then in his tousled<br> hair.<br> <br> Roscoe's son moved up into the first grade after a year, but Benjamin<br> stayed on in the kindergarten. He was very happy. Sometimes when other<br> tots talked about what they would do when they grew up a shadow would<br> cross his little face as if in a dim, childish way he realized that<br> those were things in which he was never to share.<br> <br> The days flowed on in monotonous content. He went back a third year to<br> the kindergarten, but he was too little now to understand what the<br> bright shining strips of paper were for. He cried because the other<br> boys were bigger than he, and he was afraid of them. The teacher<br> talked to him, but though he tried to understand he could not<br> understand at all.<br> <br> He was taken from the kindergarten. His nurse, Nana, in her starched<br> gingham dress, became the center of his tiny world. On bright days<br> they walked in the park; Nana would point at a great gray monster and<br> say ‘elephant,’ and Benjamin would say it after her, and when he was<br> being undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud<br> to her: ‘Elyphant, elyphant, elyphant.’ Sometimes Nana let him jump on<br> the bed, which was fun, because if you sat down exactly right it would<br> bounce you up on your feet again, and if you said ‘Ah’ for a long time<br> while you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect.<br> <br> He loved to take a big cane from the hat-rack and go around hitting<br> chairs and tables with it and saying: ‘Fight, fight, fight.’ When<br> there were people there the old ladies would cluck at him, which<br> interested him, and the young ladies would try to kiss him, which he<br> submitted to with mild boredom. And when the long day was done at five<br> o'clock he would go upstairs with Nana and be fed on oatmeal and nice<br> soft mushy foods with a spoon.<br> <br> There were no troublesome memories in his childish sleep; no token<br> came to him of his brave days at college, of the glittering years when<br> he flustered the hearts of many girls. There were only the white, safe<br> walls of his crib and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes,<br> and a great big orange ball that Nana pointed at just before his<br> twilight bed hour and called ‘sun.’ When the sun went his eyes were<br> sleepy--there were no dreams, no dreams to haunt him.<br> <br> The past--the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill; the<br> first years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk<br> down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved; the days<br> before that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old<br> Button house on Monroe Street with his grandfather-all these had faded<br> like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been.<br> He did not remember.<br> <br> He did not remember clearly whether the milk was warm or cool at his<br> last feeding or how the days passed--there was only his crib and<br> Nana's familiar presence. And then he remembered nothing. When he was<br> hungry he cried--that was all. Through the noons and nights he<br> breathed and over him there were soft mumblings and murmurings that he<br> scarcely heard, and faintly differentiated smells, and light and<br> darkness.<br> <br> Then it was all dark, and his white crib and the dim faces that moved<br> above him, and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether<br> from his mind.</p><br>JOHN T. UNGER came from a family that had been well known in Hades−−a small town on the Mississippi<br> River−−for several generations.<br> John's father had held the amateur golf championship through many a heated contest; Mrs. Unger was known<br> ‘from hot−box to hot−bed,’ as the local phrase went, for her political addresses; and young John T. Unger, who<br> had just turned sixteen, had danced all the latest dances from New York before he put on long trousers. And now,<br> for a certain time, he was to be away from home. That respect for a New England education which is the bane of<br> all provincial places, which drains them yearly of their most promising young men, had seized upon his parents.<br> Nothing would suit them but that he should go to St. Midas' School near Boston−− Hades was too small to hold<br> their darling and gifted son.<br> Now in Hades−−as you know if you ever have been there−−the names of the more fashionable preparatory<br> schools and colleges mean very little. The inhabitants have been so long out of the world that, though they make a<br> show of keeping up to date in dress and manners and literature, they depend to a great extent on hearsay, and a<br> function that in Hades would be considered elaborate would doubtless be hailed by a Chicago beef−princess as<br> ‘perhaps a little tacky.’<br> John T. Unger was on the eve of departure. Mrs. Unger, with maternal fatuity, packed his trunks full of linen suits<br> and electric fans, and Mr. Unger presented his son with an asbestos pocket−book stuffed with money.<br> ‘Remember, you are always welcome here,’ he said. ‘You can be sure boy, that we'll keep the home fires<br> burning.’<br> ‘I know,’ answered John huskily.<br> ‘Don't forget who you are and where you come from,’ continued his father proudly, ‘and you can do nothing to<br> harm you. You are an Unger−−from Hades.’<br> So the old man and the young shook hands and John walked away with tears streaming from his eyes. Ten<br> minutes later he had passed outside the city limits, and he stopped to glance back for the last time. Over the gates<br> the old−fashioned Victorian motto seemed strangely attractive to him. His father had tried time and time again to<br> have it changed to something with a little more push and verve about it, such as ‘Hades−−Your Opportunity,’ or<br> else a plain ‘Welcome’ sign set over a hearty handshake pricked out in electric lights. The old motto was a little<br> depressing, Mr. Unger had thought−−but now....<br> So John took his look and then set his face resolutely toward his destination. And, as he turned away, the lights of<br> Hades against the sky seemed full of a warm and passionate beauty.<br> St. Midas' School is half an hour from Boston in a Rolls−Pierce motorcar. The actual distance will never be<br> known, for no one, except John T. Unger, had ever arrived there save in a Rolls−Pierce and probably no one ever<br> will again. St. Midas' is the most expensive and the most exclusive boys' preparatory school in the world.<br> John's first two years there passed pleasantly. The fathers of all the boys were money−kings and John spent his<br> summers visiting at fashionable resorts. While he was very fond of all the boys he visited, their fathers struck him<br> as being much of a piece, and in his boyish way he often wondered at their exceeding sameness. When he told<br> them where his home was they would ask jovially, ‘Pretty hot down there?’ and John would muster a faint smile<br> and answer, ‘It certainly is.’ His response would have been heartier had they not all made this joke−−at best<br> varying it with, ‘Is it hot enough for you down there?’ which he hated just as much.<br> In the middle of his second year at school, a quiet, handsome boy named Percy Washington had been put in John's<br> form. The newcomer was pleasant in his manner and exceedingly well dressed even for St. Midas', but for some<br> reason he kept aloof from the other boys. The only person with whom he was intimate was John T. Unger, but<br> even to John he was entirely uncommunicative concerning his home or his family. That he was wealthy went<br> without saying, but beyond a few such deductions John knew little of his friend, so it promised rich confectionery<br> for his curiosity when Percy invited him to spend the summer at his home ‘in the West.’ He accepted, without<br> hesitation.<br> It was only when they were in the train that Percy became, for the first time, rather communicative. One day while<br> they were eating lunch in the dining−car and discussing the imperfect characters of several of the boys at school,<br> Percy suddenly changed his tone and made an abrupt remark.<br> ‘My father,’ he said, ‘is by far the richest man in the world.’<br> ‘Oh,’ said John, politely. He could think of no answer to make to this confidence. He considered ‘That's very<br> nice,’ but it sounded hollow and was on the point of saying, ‘Really?’ but refrained since it would seem to<br> question Percy's statement. And such an astounding statement could scarcely be questioned.<br> ‘By far the richest,’ repeated Percy.<br> ‘I was reading in the World Almanac,’ began John, ‘that there was one man in America with an income of over<br> five million a year and four men with incomes of over three million a year, and−−’<br> ‘Oh, they're nothing.’ Percy's mouth was a half−moon of scorn. ‘Catchpenny capitalists, financial small−fry,<br> petty merchants and money−lenders. My father could buy them out and not know he'd done it.’<br> ‘But how does he−−’<br> ‘Why haven't they put down his income tax? Because he doesn't pay any. At least he pays a little one−−but he<br> doesn't pay any on his real income.’<br> ‘He must be very rich,’ said John simply. ‘I'm glad. I like very rich people.<br> ‘The richer a fella is, the better I like him.’ There was a look of passionate frankness upon his dark face. ‘I visited<br> the Schnlitzer−Murphys last Easter. Vivian Schnlitzer−Murphy had rubies as big as hen's eggs, and sapphires that<br> were like globes with lights inside them−−’<br> ‘I love jewels,’ agreed Percy enthusiastically. ‘Of course I wouldn't want any one at school to know about it, but<br> I've got quite a collection myself I used to collect them instead of stamps.’<br> ‘And diamonds,’ continued John eagerly. ‘The Schnlitzer−Murphys had diamonds as big as walnuts−−’<br> ‘That's nothing.’ Percy had leaned forward and dropped his voice to a low whisper. ‘That's nothing at all. My<br> father has a diamond bigger than the Ritz−Carlton Hotel.’<br> <br> II<br> THE MONTANA sunset lay between two mountains like a gigantic bruise from which dark arteries spread<br> themselves over a poisoned sky. An immense distance under the sky crouched the village of Fish, minute, dismal,<br> and forgotten. There were twelve men, so it was said, in the village of Fish, twelve somber and inexplicable souls<br> who sucked a lean milk from the almost literally bare rock upon which a mysterious populatory force had<br> begotten them. They had become a race apart, these twelve men of Fish, like some species developed by an early<br> whim of nature, which on second thought had abandoned them to struggle and extermination.<br> Out of the blue−black bruise in the distance crept a long line of moving lights upon the desolation of the land, and<br> the twelve men of Fish gathered like ghosts at the shanty depot to watch the passing of the seven o'clock train, the<br> Transcontinental Express from Chicago. Six times or so a year the Transcontinental Express, through some<br> inconceivable jurisdiction, stopped at the village of Fish, and when this occurred a figure or so would disembark,<br> mount into a buggy that always appeared from out of the dusk, and drive off toward the bruised sunset. The<br> observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon had become a sort of cult among the men of Fish. To<br> observe, that was all; there remained in them none of the vital quality of illusion which would make them wonder<br> or speculate, else a religion might have grown up around these mysterious visitations. But the men of Fish were<br> beyond all religion−−the barest and most savage tenets of even Christianity could gain no foothold on that barren<br> rock−−so there was no altar, no priest, no sacrifice; only each night at seven the silent concourse by the shanty<br> depot, a congregation who lifted up a prayer of dim, anaemic wonder.<br> On this June night, the Great Brakeman, whom, had they deified any one, they might well have chosen as their<br> celestial protagonist, had ordained that the seven o'clock train should leave its human (or inhuman) deposit at<br> Fish. At two minutes after seven Percy Washington and John T. Unger disembarked, hurried past the spellbound,<br> the agape, the fearsome eyes of the twelve men of Fish, mounted into a buggy which had obviously appeared<br> from nowhere, and drove away.<br> After half an hour, when the twilight had coagulated into dark, the silent negro who was driving the buggy hailed<br> an opaque body somewhere ahead of them in the gloom. In response to his cry, it turned upon them a luminous<br> disk which regarded them like a malignant eye out of the unfathomable night. As they came closer, John saw that<br> it was the tail−light of an immense automobile, larger and more magnificent than any he had ever seen. Its body<br> was of gleaming metal richer than nickel and lighter than silver, and the hubs of the wheels were studded with<br> iridescent geometric figures of green and yellow−−John did not dare to guess whether they were glass or jewel.<br> Two negroes, dressed in glittering livery such as one sees in pictures of royal processions in London, were<br> standing at attention beside the car and as the two young men dismounted from the buggy they were greeted in<br> some language which the guest could not understand, but which seemed to be an extreme form of the Southern<br> negro's dialect.<br> ‘Get in,’ said Percy to his friend, as their trunks were tossed to the ebony roof of the limousine. ‘Sorry we had to<br> bring you this far in that buggy, but of course it wouldn't do for the people on the train or those Godforsaken fellas<br> in Fish to see this automobile.’<br> ‘Gosh! What a car!’ This ejaculation was provoked by its interior. John saw that the upholstery consisted of a<br> thousand minute and exquisite tapestries of silk, woven with jewels and embroideries, and set upon a background<br> of cloth of gold. The two armchair seats in which the boys luxuriated were covered with stuff that resembled<br> duvetyn, but seemed woven in numberless colors of the ends of ostrich feathers.<br> ‘What a car!’ cried John again, in amazement.<br> ‘This thing?’ Percy laughed. ‘Why, it's just an old junk we use for a station wagon.’<br> By this time they were gliding along through the darkness toward the break between the two mountains.<br> ‘We'll be there in an hour and a half,’ said Percy, looking at the clock. ‘I may as well tell you it's not going to be<br> like anything you ever saw before.’<br> If the car was any indication of what John would see, he was prepared to be astonished indeed. The simple piety<br> prevalent in Hades has the earnest worship of and respect for riches as the first article of its creed−−had John felt<br> otherwise than radiantly humble before them, his parents would have turned away in horror at the blasphemy.<br> They had now reached and were entering the break between the two mountains and almost immediately the way<br> became much rougher.<br> ‘If the moon shone down here, you'd see that we're in a big gulch,’ said Percy, trying to peer out of the window.<br> He spoke a few words into the mouthpiece and immediately the footman turned on a search−light and swept the<br> hillsides with an immense beam.<br> ‘Rocky, you see. An ordinary car would be knocked to pieces in half an hour. In fact, it'd take a tank to navigate it<br> unless you knew the way. You notice we're going uphill now.’<br> They were obviously ascending, and within a few minutes the car was crossing a high rise, where they caught a<br> glimpse of a pale moon newly risen in the distance. The car stopped suddenly and several figures took shape out<br> of the dark beside it−−these were negroes also. Again the two young men were saluted in the same dimly<br> recognizable dialect; then the negroes set to work and four immense cables dangling from overhead were attached<br> with hooks to the hubs of the great jeweled wheels. At a resounding ‘Hey−yah!’ John felt the car being lifted<br> slowly from the ground−− up and up−−clear of the tallest rocks on both sides−−then higher, until he could see a<br> wavy, moonlit valley stretched out before him in sharp contrast to the quagmire of rocks that they had just left.<br> Only on one side was there still rock−−and then suddenly there was no rock beside them or anywhere around.<br> It was apparent that they had surmounted some immense knife−blade of stone, projecting perpendicularly into the<br> air. In a moment they were going down again, and finally with a soft bump they were landed upon the smooth<br> earth.<br> ‘The worst is over,’ said Percy, squinting out the window. ‘It's only five miles from here, and our own<br> road−−tapestry brick−−all the way. This belongs to us. This is where the United States ends, father says.’<br> ‘Are we in Canada?’<br> ‘We are not. We're in the middle of the Montana Rockies. But you are now on the only five square miles of land<br> in the country that's never been surveyed.’<br> ‘Why hasn't it? Did they forget it?’<br> ‘No,’ said Percy, grinning, ‘they tried to do it three times. The first time my grandfather corrupted a whole<br> department of the State survey; the second time he had the official maps of the United States tinkered with−−that<br> held them for fifteen years. The last time was harder. My father fixed it so that their compasses were in the<br> strongest magnetic field ever artificially set up. He had a whole set of surveying instruments made with a slight<br> defection that would allow for this territory not to appear, and he substituted them for the ones that were to be<br> used. Then he had a river deflected and he had what looked like a village built up on its banks−−so that they'd see<br> it, and think it was a town ten miles farther up the valley. There's only one thing my father's afraid of,’ he<br> concluded, ‘only one thing in the world that could be used to find us out.’<br> ‘What's that?’<br> Percy sank his voice to a whisper.<br> ‘Aeroplanes,’ he breathed. ‘We've got half a dozen anti−aircraft guns and we've arranged it so far−−but there've<br> been a few deaths and a great many prisoners. Not that we mind that, you know, father and I, but it upsets mother<br> and the girls, and there's always the chance that some time we won't be able to arrange it.’<br> Shreds and tatters of chinchilla, courtesy clouds in the green moon's heaven, were passing the green moon like<br> precious Eastern stuffs paraded for the inspection of some Tartar Khan. It seemed to John that it was day, and that<br> he was looking at some lads sailing above him in the air, showering down tracts and patent medicine circulars,<br> with their messages of hope for despairing, rockbound hamlets. It seemed to him that he could see them look<br> down out of the clouds and stare−−and stare at whatever there was to stare at in this place whither he was<br> bound−−What then? Were they induced to land by some insidious device there to be immured far from patent<br> medicines and from tracts until the judgment day−−or, should they fail to fall into the trap, did a quick puff of<br> smoke and the sharp round of a splitting shell bring them drooping to earth−−and ‘upset’ Percy's mother and<br> sisters. John shook his head and the wraith of a hollow laugh issued silently from his parted lips. What desperate<br> transaction lay hidden here? What a moral expedient of a bizarre Croesus? What terrible and golden mystery? . . .<br> The chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and outside the Montana night was bright as day. The tapestry brick of<br> the road was smooth to the tread of the great tires as they rounded a still, moonlit lake; they passed into darkness<br> for a moment, a pine grove, pungent and cool, then they came out into a broad avenue of lawn and John's<br> exclamation of pleasure was simultaneous with Percy's taciturn ‘We're home.’<br> Full in the light of the stars, an exquisite ch_teau rose from the borders of the lake, climbed in marble radiance<br> half the height of an adjoining mountain, then melted in grace, in perfect symmetry, in translucent feminine<br> languor, into the massed darkness of a forest of pine. The many towers, the slender tracery of the sloping parapets,<br> the chiselled wonder of a thousand yellow windows with their oblongs and hectagons and triangles of golden<br> light, the shattered softness of the intersecting planes of star−shine and blue shade, all trembled on John's spirit<br> like a chord of music. On one of the towers, the tallest, the blackest at its base, an arrangement of exterior lights at<br> the top made a sort of floating fairyland−−and as John gazed up in warm enchantment the faint acciaccare sound<br> of violins drifted down in a rococo harmony that was like nothing he had ever heard before. Then in a moment the<br> car stopped before wide, high marble steps around which the night air was fragrant with a host of flowers. At the<br> top of the steps two great doors swung silently open and amber light flooded out upon the darkness, silhouetting<br> the figure of an exquisite lady with black, high−piled hair, who held out her arms toward them.<br> ‘Mother,’ Percy was saying, ‘this is my friend, John Unger, from Hades.’<br> Afterward John remembered that first night as a daze of many colors, of quick sensory impressions, of music soft<br> as a voice in love, and of the beauty of things, lights and shadows, and motions and faces. There was a<br> whitehaired man who stood drinking a many−hued cordial from a crystal thimble set on a golden stem. There was<br> a girl with a flowery face, dressed like Titania with braided sapphires in her hair. There was a room where the<br> solid, soft gold of the walls yielded to the pressure of his hand, and a room that was like a platonic conception of<br> the ultimate prism−−ceiling, floor, and all, it was lined with an unbroken mass of diamonds, diamonds of every<br> size and shape, until, lit with tall violet lamps in the corners, it dazzled the eyes with a whiteness that could be<br> compared only with itself, beyond human wish or dream.<br> Through a maze of these rooms the two boys wandered. Sometimes the floor under their feet would flame in<br> brilliant patterns from lighting below, patterns of barbaric clashing colors, of pastel delicacy, of sheer whiteness,<br> or of subtle and intricate mosaic, surely from some mosque on the Adriatic Sea. Sometimes beneath layers of<br> thick crystal he would see blue or green water swirling, inhabited by vivid fish and growths of rainbow foliage.<br> Then they would be treading on furs of every texture and color or along corridors of palest ivory, unbroken as<br> though carved complete from the gigantic tusks of dinosaurs extinct before the age of man. . . .<br> Then a hazily remembered transition, and they were at dinner−−where each plate was of two almost imperceptible<br> layers of solid diamond between which was curiously worked a filigree of emerald design, a shaving sliced from<br> green air. Music, plangent and unobtrusive, drifted down through far corridors−−his chair, feathered and curved<br> insidiously to his back, seemed to engulf and overpower him as he drank his first glass of port. He tried drowsily<br> to answer a question that had been asked him, but the honeyed luxury that clasped his body added to the illusion<br> of sleep−−jewels, fabrics, wines, and metals blurred before his eyes into a sweet mist. . . .<br> ‘Yes,’ he replied with a polite effort, ‘it certainly is hot enough for me down there.’<br> He managed to add a ghostly laugh; then, without movement, without resistance, he seemed to float off and away,<br> leaving an iced dessert that was pink as a dream. . . . He fell asleep.<br> When he awoke he knew that several hours had passed. He was in a great quiet room with ebony walls and a dull<br> illumination that was too faint, too subtle, to be called a light. His young host was standing over him.<br> ‘You fell asleep at dinner,’ Percy was saying. ‘I nearly did, too−−it was such a treat to be comfortable again after<br> this year of school. Servants undressed and bathed you while you were sleeping.’<br> ‘Is this a bed or a cloud?’ sighed John. ‘Percy, Percy−−before you go, I want to apologize.’<br> ‘For what?’<br> ‘For doubting you when you said you had a diamond as big as the Ritz−Carlton Hotel.’<br> Percy smiled.<br> ‘I thought you didn't believe me. It's that mountain, you know.’<br> ‘What mountain?’<br> ‘The mountain the ch_teau rests on. It's not very big, for a mountain. But except about fifty feet of sod and gravel<br> on top it's solid diamond.One diamond, one cubic mile without a flaw. Aren't you listening? Say−−−−’<br> But John T. Unger had again fallen asleep.<br> III<br> MORNING. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with<br> sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day.<br> A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.<br> ‘Good−evening,’ muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.<br> ‘Good−morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don't get up−−I'll put you in, if you'll just unbutton<br> your pajamas−−there. Thank you, sir.’<br> John lay quietly as his pajamas were removed−−he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child<br> by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up<br> slowly on its side−−he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its<br> drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same<br> temperature as his body.<br> He looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had<br> been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the<br> floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium,<br> and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even<br> gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the<br> crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea−green glass.<br> I suppose, sir, that you'd like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning sir−−and perhaps cold salt water to finish.’<br> The negro was standing beside him.<br> ‘Yes,’ agreed John, smiling inanely, ‘as you please.’ Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meager<br> standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.<br> The negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John<br> discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose color and jets of<br> liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little<br> paddle−wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped<br> him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.<br> ‘Shall I turn on the moving−picture machine, sir?’ suggested the negro deferentially. ‘There's a good one−reel<br> comedy in this machine to−day, or can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it.’<br> ‘No, thanks,’ answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his at too much to desire any distraction. But<br> distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes ripping a<br> melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more<br> fragile than the lace of u s that covered and charmed him.<br> After a cold salt−water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch<br> covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous chair<br> while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.<br> ‘Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting−room,’ said the negro, when these operations were finished. ‘My name is<br> Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning.’<br> John walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living−room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy,<br> gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.<br> IV<br> THIS IS A STORY of the Washington family as Percy sketched it for John during breakfast.<br> The father of the present Mr. Washington had been a Virginian, a direct descendant of George Washington, and<br> Lord Baltimore. At the close of the Civil War he was a twenty−five−year−old Colonel with a played−out<br> plantation and about a thousand dollars in gold.<br> Fitz−Norman Culpepper Washington, for that was the young Colonel's name, decided to present the Virginia<br> estate to his younger brother and go West. He selected two dozen of the most faithful blacks, who, of course,<br> worshipped him, and bought twenty−five tickets to the West, where he intended to take out land in their names<br> and start a sheep and cattle ranch.<br> When he had been in Montana for less than a month and things were going very poorly indeed, he stumbled on<br> his great discovery. He had lost his way when riding in the hills, and after a day without food he began to grow<br> hungry. As he was without his rifle, he was forced to pursue a squirrel, and in the course of the pursuit he noticed<br> that it was carrying something shiny in its mouth. Just before it vanished into its hole−−for Providence did not<br> intend that this squirrel should alleviate his hunger−−it dropped its burden. Sitting down to consider the situation<br> Fitz−Norman's eye was caught by a gleam in the grass beside him. In ten seconds he had completely lost his<br> appetite and gained one hundred thousand dollars. The squirrel, which had refused with annoying persistence to<br> become food, had made him a present of a large and perfect diamond.<br> Late that night he found his way to camp and twelve hours later all the males among his darkies were back by the<br> squirrel hole digging furiously at the side of the mountain. He told them he had discovered a rhinestone mine,<br> and, as only one or two of them had ever seen even a small diamond before, they believed him, without question.<br> When the magnitude of his discovery became apparent to him, he found himself in a quandary. The mountain was<br> a diamond−−it was literally nothing else but solid diamond. He filled four saddle bags full of glittering samples<br> and started on horseback for St. Paul. There he managed to dispose of half a dozen small stones−−when he tried a<br> larger one a storekeeper fainted and Fitz−Norman was arrested as a public disturber. He escaped from jail and<br> caught the train for New York, where he sold a few medium−sized diamonds and received in exchange about two<br> hundred thousand dollars in gold. But he did not dare to produce any exceptional gems−−in fact, he left New<br> York just in time. Tremendous excitement had been created in jewelry circles, not so much by the size of his<br> diamonds as by their appearance in the city from mysterious sources. Wild rumors became current that a diamond<br> mine had been discovered in the Catskills, on the Jersey coast, on Long Island, beneath Washington Square.<br> Excursion trains, packed with men carrying picks and shovels, began to leave New York hourly, bound for<br> various neighboring El Dorados. But by that time young Fitz−Norman was on his way back to Montana.<br> By the end of a fortnight he had estimated that the diamond in the mountain was approximately equal in quantity<br> to all the rest of the diamonds known to exist in the world. There was no valuing it by any regular computation,<br> however, for it was one solid diamond−−and if it were offered for sale not only would the bottom fall out of the<br> market, but also, if the value should vary with its size in the usual arithmetical progression, there would not be<br> enough gold in the world to buy a tenth part of it. And what could any one do with a diamond that size?<br> It was an amazing predicament. He was, in one sense, the richest man that ever lived−−and yet was he worth<br> anything at all? If his secret should transpire there was no telling to what measures the Government might resort<br> in order to prevent a panic, in gold as well as in jewels. They might take over the claim immediately and institute<br> a monopoly.<br> There was no alternative−−he must market his mountain in secret. He sent South for his younger brother and put<br> him in charge of his colored following−−darkies who had never realized that slavery was abolished. To make sure<br> of this, he read them a proclamation that he had composed, which announced that General Forrest had reorganized<br> the shattered Southern armies and defeated the North in one pitched battle. The negroes believed him implicitly.<br> They passed a vote declaring it a good thing and held revival services immediately.<br> Fitz−Norman himself set out for foreign parts with one hundred thousand dollars and two trunks filled with rough<br> diamonds of all sizes. He sailed for Russia in a Chinese junk and six months after his departure from Montana he<br> was in St. Petersburg. He took obscure lodgings and called immediately upon the court jeweller, announcing that<br> he had a diamond for the Czar. He remained in St. Petersburg for two weeks, in constant danger of being<br> murdered, living from lodging to lodging, and afraid to visit his trunks more than three or four times during the<br> whole fortnight.<br> On his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he was allowed to leave for India. Before he left,<br> however, the Court Treasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of fifteen million<br> dollars−−under four different aliases.<br> He returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two years. He had visited the capitals of<br> twenty−two countries and talked with five emperors, eleven kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a sultan. At<br> that time Fitz−Norman estimated his own wealth at one billion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the<br> disclosure of his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public eye for a week before being<br> invested with a history of enough fatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the days of the<br> first Babylonian Empire.<br> From 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of Fitz−Norman Washington was a long epic in gold. There were<br> side issues, of course−−he evaded the surveys, he married a Virginia lady, by whom he had a single son, and he<br> was compelled, due to a series of unfortunate complications, to murder his brother, whose unfortunate habit of<br> drinking himself into an indiscreet stupor had several times endangered their safety. But very few other murders<br> stained these happy years of progress and expansion.<br> Just before he died he changed his policy, and with all but a few million dollars of his outside wealth bought up<br> rare minerals in bulk, which he deposited in the safety vaults of banks all over the world, marked as bric−_−brac.<br> His son, Braddock Tarleton Washington, followed this policy on an even more tensive scale. The minerals were<br> converted into the rarest of all elements−−radium−−so that the equivalent of a billion dollars in gold could be<br> placed in a receptacle no bigger than a cigar box.<br> When Fitz−Norman had been dead three years his son, Braddock, decided that the business had gone far enough.<br> The amount of wealth that he and his father had taken out of the mountain was beyond all exact computation. He<br> kept a note−book in cipher in which he set down the approximate quantity of radium in each of the thousand<br> banks he patronized, and recorded the alias under which it was held. Then he did a very simple thing−−he sealed<br> up the mine.<br> He sealed up the mine. What had been taken out of it would support all the Washingtons yet to be born in<br> unparalleled luxury for generations. His one care must be the protection of his secret, lest in the possible panic<br> attendant on its discovery he should be reduced with all the property−holders in the world to utter poverty.<br> This was the family among whom John T. Unger was staying. This was the story he heard in his silver−walled<br> living−room the morning after his arrival.<br> IV<br> AFTER BREAKFAST, John found his way out the great marble entrance and looked curiously at the scene<br> before him. The whole valley, from the diamond mountain to the steep granite cliff five miles away, still gave off<br> a breath of golden haze which hovered idly above the fine sweep of lawns and lakes and gardens. Here and there<br> clusters of elms made delicate groves of shade, contrasting strangely with the tough masses of pine forest that<br> held the hills in a grip of dark−blue green. Even as John looked he saw three fawns in single file patter out from<br> one clump about a half mile away and disappear with awkward gayety into the black−ribbed half−light of another.<br> John would not have been surprised to see a goat−foot piping his way among the trees or to catch a glimpse of<br> pink nymph−skin and flying yellow hair between the greenest of the green leaves.<br> In some such cool hope he descended the marble steps, disturbing faintly the sleep of two silky Russian<br> wolfhounds at the bottom, and set off along a walk of white and blue brick that seemed to lead in no particular<br> direction.<br> He was enjoying himself as much as he was able. It is youth's felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never<br> live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future−−flowers<br> and gold, girls and stars, they are only prefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young<br> dream.<br> John rounded a soft corner where the massed rose−bushes filled the air with heavy scent, and struck off across a<br> park toward a patch of moss under some trees. He had never lain upon moss, and he wanted to see whether it was<br> really soft enough to justify the use of its name as an adjective. Then he saw a girl coming toward him over the<br> grass. She was the most beautiful person he had ever seen<br> She was dressed in a white little gown that came just below her knees, and a wreath of mignonettes clasped with<br> blue slices of sapphire bound up her hair. Her pink bare feet scattered the dew before them as she came. She was<br> younger than John−−not more than sixteen.<br> ‘Hello,’ she cried softly, ‘I'm Kismine.’<br> She was much more than that to John already. He advanced toward her, scarcely moving as he drew near lest he<br> should tread on her bare toes.<br> ‘You haven't met me,’ said her soft voice. Her blue eyes added, ‘Oh, but you've missed a great deal!’ . . . ‘You<br> met my sister, Jasmine, last night. I was sick with lettuce poisoning,’ went on her soft voice, and her eyes<br> continued, ‘and when I'm sick I'm sweet−−and when I'm well.’<br> ‘You have made an enormous impression on me,’ said John's eyes, ‘and I'm not so slow myself’−−’How do you<br> do?’ said his voice. ‘I hope you're better this morning.’−−’You darling,’ added his eyes tremulously.<br> John observed that they had been walking along the path. On her suggestion they sat down together upon the<br> moss, the softness of which he failed to determine.<br> He was critical about women. A single defect−−a thick ankle, a hoarse voice, a glass eye−−was enough to make<br> him utterly indifferent. And here for the first time in his life he was beside a girl who seemed to him the<br> incarnation of physical perfection.<br> ‘Are you from the East?’ asked Kismine with charming interest.<br> ‘No,’ answered John simply. ‘I'm from Hades.’<br> Either she had never heard of Hades, or she could think of no pleasant comment to make upon it, for she did not<br> discuss it further.<br> ‘I'm going East to school this fall,’ she said. ‘D'you think I'll like it? I'm going to New York to Miss Bulge's. It's<br> very strict, but you see over the weekends I'm going to live at home with the family in our New York house,<br> because father heard that the girls had to go walking two by two.’<br> ‘Your father wants you to be proud,’ observed John.<br> ‘We are,’ she answered, her eyes shining with dignity.’None of us has ever been punished. Father said we never<br> should be. Once when my sister Jasmine was a little girl she pushed him down−stairs and he just got up and<br> limped away.<br> ‘Mother was−−well, a little startled,’ continued Kismine, ‘when she heard that you were from−−from where you<br> are from, you know. She said that when she was a young girl−−but then, you see, she's a Spaniard and<br> old−fashioned.’<br> ‘Do you spend much time out here?’ asked John, to conceal the fact that he was somewhat hurt by this remark. It<br> seemed an unkind allusion to his provincialism.<br> ‘Percy and Jasmine and I are here every summer, but next summer Jasmine is going to Newport. She's coming out<br> in London a year from this fall. She'll be presented at court.’<br> ‘Do you know, ‘ began John hesitantly, ‘you're much more sophisticated than I thought you were when I first saw<br> you?’<br> ‘Oh, no, I'm not,’ she exclaimed hurriedly. ‘Oh, I wouldn't think of being. I think that sophisticated young people<br> are terriblycommon, don't you? I'm not at all, really. If you say I am, I'm going to cry.’<br> She was so distressed that her lip was trembling. John was impelled to protest:<br> I didn't mean that; I only said it to tease you.’<br> ‘Because I wouldn't mind if I were,’ she persisted. ‘but I'm not. I'm very innocent and girlish. I never smoke, or<br> drink, or read anything except poetry. I know scarcely any mathematics or chemistry. I dress very simply−−in<br> fact, I scarcely dress at all. I think sophisticated is the last thing you can say about me. I believe that girls ought to<br> enjoy their youths in a wholesome way.’<br> ‘I do, too,’ said John heartily.<br> Kismine was cheerful again. She smiled at him, and a still−born tear dripped from the corner of one blue eye.<br> ‘I like you,’ she whispered, intimately. ‘Are you going to spend all your time with Percy while you're here, or<br> will you be nice to me. Just think−−I'm absolutely fresh ground. I've never had a boy in love with me in all my<br> life. I've never been allowed even to see boys alone−−except Percy. I came all the way out here into this grove<br> hoping to run into you, where the family wouldn't be around.<br> Deeply flattered, John bowed from the hips as he had been taught at dancing school in Hades.<br> ‘We'd better go now,’ said Kismine sweetly. ‘I have to be with mother at eleven. You haven't asked me to kiss<br> you once. I thought boys always did that nowadays.’<br> John drew himself up proudly.<br> ‘Some of them do,’ he answered, ‘but not me. Girls don't do that sort of thing−−in Hades.’<br> Side by side they walked back toward the house.<br> VI<br> JOHN STOOD facing Mr. Braddock Washington in the full sunlight. The elder man was about forty with a proud,<br> vacuous face, intelligent eyes, and a robust figure. In the mornings he smelt of horses−−the best horses. He<br> carried a plain walking−stick of gray birch with a single large opal for a grip. He and Percy were showing John<br> around.<br> ‘The slaves' quarters are there.’ His walking−stick indicated a cloister of marble on their left that ran in graceful<br> Gothic along the side of the mountain. ‘In my youth I was distracted for a while from the business of life by a<br> period of absurd idealism. During that time they lived in luxury. For instance, I equipped every one of their rooms<br> with a tile bath.’<br> ‘I suppose,’ ventured John, with an ingratiating laugh, ‘that they used the bathtubs to keep coal in. Mr.<br> Schnlitzer−Murphy told me that once he−−−−’<br> ‘The opinions of Mr. Schnlitzer−Murphy are of little importance, I should imagine,’ interrupted Braddock<br> Washington, coldly. ‘My slaves did not keep coal in their bathtubs. They had orders to bathe every day, and they<br> did. If they hadn't I might have ordered a sulphuric acid shampoo. I discontinued the baths for quite another<br> reason. Several of them caught cold and died. Water is not good for certain races−−except as a beverage.’<br> John laughed, and then decided to nod his head in sober agreement. Braddock Washington made him<br> uncomfortable.<br> ‘All these negroes are descendants of the ones my father brought North with him. There are about two hundred<br> and fifty now. You notice that they've lived so long apart from the world that their original dialect has become an<br> almost indistinguishable patois. We bring a few of them up to speak English−−my secretary and two or three of<br> the house servants.<br> ‘This is the golf course,’ he continued, as they strolled along the velvet winter grass. ‘It's all a green, you see−−no<br> fairway, no rough, no hazards.’<br> He smiled pleasantly at John.<br> ‘Many men in the cage, father?’ asked Percy suddenly.<br> Braddock Washington stumbled, and let forth an involuntary curse.<br> ‘One less than there should be,’ he ejaculated darkly−−and then added after a moment, ‘We've had difficulties.’<br> ‘Mother was telling me,’ exclaimed Percy, ‘that Italian teacher−−−−’<br> ‘A ghastly error,’ said Braddock Washington angrily. ‘But of course there's a good chance that we may have got<br> him. Perhaps he fell somewhere in the woods or stumbled over a cliff. And then there's always the probability that<br> if he did get away his story wouldn't be believed. Nevertheless, I've had two dozen men looking for him in<br> different towns around here.’<br> ‘And no luck?’<br> ‘Some. Fourteen of them reported to my agent that they'd each killed a man answering to that description, but of<br> course it was probably only the reward they were after−−−−’<br> He broke off. They had come to a large cavity in the earth about the circumference of a merry−go−round and<br> covered by a strong iron grating. Braddock Washington beckoned to John, and pointed his cane down through the<br> grating. John stepped to the edge and gazed. Immediately his ears were assailed by a wild clamor from below.<br> ‘Come on down to Hell!’<br> ‘Hello, kiddo, how's the air up there?’<br> ‘Hey! Throw us a rope!’<br> ‘Got an old doughnut, Buddy, or a couple of second−hand sandwiches?’<br> ‘Say, fella, if you'll push down that guy you're with, we'll show you a quick disappearance scene.’<br> ‘Paste him one for me, will you?’<br> It was too dark to see clearly into the pit below, but John could tell from the coarse optimism and rugged vitality<br> of the remarks and voices that they proceeded from middle−class Americans of the more spirited type. Then Mr.<br> Washington put out his cane and touched a button in the grass, and the scene below sprang into light.<br> ‘These are some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune to discover El Dorado,’ he remarked.<br> Below them there had appeared a large hollow in the earth shaped like the interior of a bowl. The sides were steep<br> and apparently of polished glass, and on its slightly concave surface stood about two dozen men clad in the half<br> costume, half uniform, of aviators. Their upturned faces, lit with wrath with malice, with despair, with cynical<br> humor, were covered by long growths of beard, but with the exception of a few who had pined perceptibly away,<br> they seemed to be a well−fed, healthy lot.<br> Braddock Washington drew a garden chair to the edge of the pit and sat down.<br> ‘Well, how are you, boys?’ he inquired genially.<br> A chorus of execration in which all joined except a few too dispirited to cry out, rose up into the sunny air, but<br> Braddock Washington heard it with unruffled composure. When its last echo had died away he spoke again.<br> ‘Have you thought up a way out of your difficulty?’<br> From here and there among them a remark floated up.<br> ‘We decided to stay here for love!’<br> ‘Bring us up there and we'll find us a way!’<br> Braddock Washington waited until they were again quiet. Then he said:<br> ‘I've told you the situation. I don't want you here. I wish to heaven I'd never seen you. Your own curiosity got you<br> here, and any time that you can think of a way out which protects me and my interests I'll be glad to consider it.<br> But so long as you confine your efforts to digging tunnels−−yes, I know about the new one you've started−−you<br> won't get very far. This isn't as hard on you as you make it out, with all your howling for the loved ones at home.<br> If you were the type who worried much about the loved ones at home, you'd never have taken up aviation.’<br> A tall man moved apart from the others, and held up his hand to call his captor's attention to what he was about to<br> say.<br> ‘Let me ask you a few questions!’ he cried. ‘You pretend to be a fair−minded man.’<br> ‘How absurd. How could a man of my position be fair−minded toward you? You might as well speak of a<br> Spaniard being fair−minded toward a piece of steak.’<br> At this harsh observation the faces of the two dozen steaks fell, but the tall man continued:<br> ‘All right!’ he cried. ‘We've argued this out before. You're not a humanitarian and you're not fair−minded, but<br> you're human−−at least you say you are−−and you ought to be able to put yourself in our place for long enough to<br> think how−−how−−how−−−−<br> ‘How what?’ demanded Washington, coldly.<br> ‘−−how unnecessary−−−−’<br> ‘Not to me.’<br> ‘Well,−−how cruel−−−−’<br> ‘We've covered that. Cruelty doesn't exist where self−preservation is involved. You've been soldiers; you know<br> that. Try another.’<br> ‘Well, then, how stupid.’ ‘There,’ admitted Washington, ‘I grant you that. But try to think of an alternative. I've<br> offered to have all or any of you painlessly executed if you wish. I've offered to have your wives, sweethearts,<br> children, and mothers kidnapped and brought out here. I'll enlarge your place down there and feed and clothe you<br> the rest of your lives. If there was some method of producing permanent amnesia I'd have all of you operated on<br> and released immediately, somewhere outside of my preserves. But that's as far as my ideas go.’<br> ‘How about trusting us not to peach on you?’ cried some one.<br> ‘You don't proffer that suggestion seriously,’ said Washington, with an expression of scorn. ‘I did take out one<br> man to teach my daughter Italian. Last week he got away.’<br> A wild yell of jubilation went up suddenly from two dozen throats and a pandemonium of joy ensued. The<br> prisoners clog−danced and cheered and yodled and wrestled with one another in a sudden uprush of animal<br> spirits. They even ran up the glass sides of the bowl as far as they could, and slid back to the bottom upon the<br> natural cushions of their bodies. The tall man started a song in which they all joined−−<br> ‘oh, we'll hang the kaiser<br> on a sour apple tree−−−−’<br> Braddock Washington sat in inscrutable silence until the song was over. ‘You see,’ he remarked, when he could<br> gain a modicum of attention. ‘I bear you no ill−will. I like to see you enjoying yourselves. That's why I didn't tell<br> you the whole story at once. The man−−what was his name? Critchtichiello? −−was shot by some of my agents in<br> fourteen different places.’<br> Not guessing that the places referred to were cities, the tumult of rejoicing subsided immediately.<br> ‘Nevertheless,’ cried Washington with a touch of anger, ‘he tried to run away. Do you expect me to take chances<br> with any of you after an experience like that?’<br> Again a series of ejaculations went up.<br> ‘Sure!’<br> ‘Would your daughter like to learn Chinese?’<br> ‘Hey, I can speak Italian! My mother was a wop.’<br> ‘Maybe she'd like t'learna speak N'Yawk!’<br> ‘If she's the little one with the big blue eyes I can teach her a lot of things better than Italian.’<br> ‘I know some Irish songs−−and I could hammer brass once't.<br> Mr. Washington reached forward suddenly with his cane and pushed the button in the grass so that the picture<br> below went out instantly, and there remained only that great dark mouth covered dismally with the black teeth of<br> the grating.<br> ‘Hey!’ called a single voice from below, ‘you ain't goin' away without givin' us your blessing?’<br> But Mr. Washington, followed by the two boys, was already strolling on toward the ninth hole of the golf course,<br> as though the pit and its contents were no more than a hazard over which his facile iron had triumphed with ease.<br> VII<br> JULY UNDER the lee of the diamond mountain was a month of blanket nights and of warm, glowing days. John<br> and Kismine were in love. He did not know that the little gold football (inscribed with the legend Pro deo et<br> patria et St. Midas) which he had given her rested on a platinum chain next to her bosom. But it did. And she for<br> her part was not aware that a large sapphire which had dropped one day from her simple coiffure was stowed<br> away tenderly in John's jewel box.<br> Late one afternoon when the ruby and ermine music room was quiet, they spent an hour there together. He held<br> her hand and she gave him such a look that he whispered her name aloud. She bent toward him−−then hesitated.<br> ‘Did you say 'Kismine'?’ she asked softly, ‘or−−−−’<br> She had wanted to be sure. She thought she might have misunderstood.<br> Neither of them had ever kissed before, but in the course of an hour it seemed to make little difference.<br> The afternoon drifted away. That night when a last breath of music drifted down from the highest tower, they each<br> lay awake, happily dreaming over the separate minutes of the day. They had decided to be married as soon as<br> possible.<br> VIII<br> EVERY DAY Mr. Washington and the two young men went hunting or fishing in the deep forests or played golf<br> around the somnolent course−−games which John diplomatically allowed his host to win−−or swam in the<br> mountain coolness of the lake. John found Mr. Washington a somewhat exacting personality−−utterly<br> uninterested in any ideas or opinions except his own. Mrs. Washington was aloof and reserved at all times. She<br> was apparently indifferent to her two daughters, and entirely absorbed in her son Percy, with whom she held<br> interminable conversations in rapid Spanish at dinner.<br> Jasmine, the elder daughter, resembled Kismine in appearance−−except that she was somewhat bow−legged, and<br> terminated in large hands and feet−−but was utterly unlike her in temperament. Her favorite books had to do with<br> poor girls who kept house for widowed fathers. John learned from Kismine that Jasmine had never recovered<br> from the shock and disappointment caused her by the termination of the World War, just as she was about to start<br> for Europe as a canteen expert. She had even pined away for a time, and Braddock Washington had taken steps to<br> promote a new war in the Balkans−−but she had seen a photograph of some wounded Serbian soldiers and lost<br> interest in the whole proceedings. But Percy and Kismine seemed to have inherited the arrogant attitude in all its<br> harsh magnificence from their father. A chaste and consistent selfishness ran like a pattern through their every<br> idea.<br> John was enchanted by the wonders of the ch_teau and the valley. Braddock Washington, so Percy told him, had<br> caused to be kidnapped a landscape gardener, an architect, a designer of state settings, and a French decadent poet<br> left over from the last century. He had put his entire force of negroes at their disposal, guaranteed to supply them<br> with any materials that the world could offer, and left them to work out some ideas of their own. But one by one<br> they had shown their uselessness. The decadent poet had at once begun bewailing his separation from the<br> boulevards in spring−−he made some vague remarks about spices, apes, and ivories, but said nothing that was of<br> any practical value. The stage designer on his part wanted to make the whole valley a series of tricks and<br> sensational effects−−a state of things that the Washingtons would soon have grown tired of. And as for the<br> architect and the landscape gardener, they thought only in terms of convention. They must make this like this and<br> that like that.<br> But they had, at least, solved the problem of what was to be done with them−−they all went mad early one<br> morning after spending the night in a single room trying to agree upon the location of a fountain, and were now<br> confined comfortably in an insane asylum at Westport, Connecticut.<br> ‘But,’ inquired John curiously, ‘who did plan all your wonderful reception rooms and halls, and approaches and<br> bathrooms−−−−?’<br> ‘Well,’ answered Percy, ‘I blush to tell you, but it was a moving−picture fella. He was the only man we found<br> who was used to playing with an unlimited amount of money, though he did tuck his napkin in his collar and<br> couldn't read or write.’<br> As August drew to a close John began to regret that he must soon go back to school. He and Kismine had decided<br> to elope the following June.<br> ‘It would be nicer to be married here,’ Kismine confessed, ‘but of course I could never get father's permission to<br> marry you at all. Next to that I'd rather elope. It's terrible for wealthy people to be married in America at<br> present−−they always have to send out bulletins to the press saying that they're going to be married in remnants,<br> when what they mean is just a peck of old second−hand pearls and some used lace worn once by the Empress<br> Eug_nie.’<br> ‘I know,’ agreed John fervently. ‘When I was visiting the Schnlitzer−Murphys, the eldest daughter, Gwendolyn,<br> married a man whose father owns half of West Virginia. She wrote home saying what a tough struggle she was<br> carrying on on his salary as a bank clerk−−and then she ended up by saying that 'Thank God, I have four good<br> maids anyhow, and that helps a little.'‘<br> ‘It's absurd,’ commented Kismine. ‘Think of the millions and millions of people in the world, laborers and all,<br> who get along with only two maids.’<br> One afternoon late in August a chance remark of Kismine's changed the face of the entire situation, and threw<br> John into a state of terror.<br> They were in their favorite grove, and between kisses John was indulging in some romantic forebodings which he<br> fancied added poignancy to their relations.<br> ‘Sometimes I think we'll never marry,’ he said sadly.<br> ‘You're too wealthy, too magnificent. No one as rich as you are can be like other girls. I should marry the<br> daughter of some well−to−do wholesale hardware man from Omaha or Sioux City, and be content with her<br> half−million.’<br> ‘I knew the daughter of a wholesale hardware man once,’ remarked Kismine. ‘I don't think you'd have been<br> contented with her. She was a friend of my sister's. She visited here.’<br> ‘Oh, then you've had other guests?’ exclaimed John in surprise.<br> Kismine seemed to regret her words.<br> ‘Oh, yes,’ she said hurriedly, ‘we've had a few.’<br> ‘But aren't you−−wasn't your father afraid they'd talk outside?’<br> ‘Oh, to some extent, to some extent,’ she answered. ‘Let's talk about something pleasanter.’<br> But John's curiosity was aroused.<br> ‘Something pleasanter!’ he demanded. ‘What's unpleasant about that? Weren't they nice girls?’<br> To his great surprise Kismine began to weep.<br> ‘Yes−−th−−that's the−−the whole t−trouble. I grew qu−quite attached to some of them. So did Jasmine, but she<br> kept inv−viting them anyway. I couldn't understand it.’<br> A dark suspicion was born in John's heart.<br> ‘Do you mean that they told, and your father had them−−removed?’<br> ‘Worse than that,’ she muttered brokenly. ‘Father took no chances−−and Jasmine kept writing them to come, and<br> they had such a good time!’<br> She was overcome by a paroxysm of grief.<br> Stunned with the horror of this revelation, John sat there open−mouthed, feeling the nerves of his body twitter like<br> so many sparrows perched upon his spinal column.<br> ‘Now, I've told you, and I shouldn't have,’ she said, calming suddenly and drying her dark blue eyes.<br> ‘Do you mean to say that your father had them murdered before they left?’<br> She nodded.<br> ‘In August usually−−or early in September. It's only natural for us to get all the pleasure out of them that we can<br> first.’<br> ‘How abdominable! How−−why, I must be going crazy! Did you really admit that−−’<br> ‘I did,’ interrupted Kismine, shrugging her shoulders. ‘We can't very well imprison them like those aviators,<br> where they'd be a continual reproach to us every day. And it's always been made easier for Jasmine and me<br> because father had it done sooner than we expected. In that way we avoided any farewell scene−−−−’<br> ‘So you murdered them! Uh!’ cried John.<br> ‘It was done very nicely. They were drugged while they were asleep−−and their families were always told that<br> they died of scarlet fever in Butte.’<br> ‘But−−I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!’<br> ‘I didn't,’ burst out Kismine. ‘I never invited one. Jasmine did. And they always had a very good time. She'd give<br> them the nicest presents toward the last. I shall probably have visitors too−−I'll harden up to it. We can't let such<br> an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of enjoying life while we have it. Think how lonesome it'd be out<br> here if we never had any one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed some of their best friends just as we have.’<br> ‘And so,’ cried John accusingly, ‘and so you were letting me make love to you and pretending to return it, and<br> talking about marriage, all the time knowing perfectly well that I'd never get out of here alive−−’<br> ‘No,’ she protested passionately. ‘Not any more. I did at first. You were here. I couldn't help that, and I thought<br> your last days might as well be pleasant for both of us. But then I fell in love with you, and−−and I'm honestly<br> sorry you're going to−−going to be put away−−though I'd rather you'd be put away than ever kiss another girl.’<br> ‘Oh, you would, would you?’ cried John ferociously.<br> ‘Much rather. Besides, I've always heard that a girl can have more fun with a man whom she knows she can never<br> marry. Oh, why did I tell you? I've probably spoiled your whole good time now, and we were really enjoying<br> things when you didn't know it. I knew it would make things sort of depressing for you.’<br> ‘Oh, you did, did you?’ John's voice trembled with anger. ‘I've heard about enough of this. If you haven't any<br> more pride and decency than to have an affair with a fellow that you know isn't much better than a corpse, I don't<br> want to have any more to do with you!’<br> ‘You're not a corpse!’ she protested in horror. ‘You're not a corpse! I won't have you saying that I kissed a<br> corpse!’<br> ‘I said nothing of the sort!’<br> ‘You did! You said I kissed a corpse!’<br> ‘I didn't ! ‘<br> Their voices had risen, but upon a sudden interruption they both subsided into immediate silence. Footsteps were<br> coming along the path in their direction, and a moment later the rose bushes were parted displaying Braddock<br> Washington, whose intelligent eyes set in his good−looking vacuous face were peering in at them.<br> ‘Who kissed a corpse?’ he demanded in obvious disapproval.<br> ‘Nobody,’ answered Kismine quickly. ‘We were just joking.’<br> ‘What are you two doing here, anyhow?’ he demanded gruffly. ‘Kismine, you ought to be−−to be reading or<br> playing golf with your sister. Go read! Go play golf! Don't let me find you here when I come back!’<br> Then he bowed at John and went up the path.<br> ‘See?’ said Kismine crossly, when he was out of hearing. ‘You've spoiled it all. We can never meet any more. He<br> won't let me meet you. He'd have you poisoned if he thought we were in love.’<br> ‘We're not, any more!’ cried John fiercely, ‘so he can set his mind at rest upon that. Moreover, don't fool yourself<br> that I'm going to stay around here. Inside of six hours I'll be over those mountains, if I have to gnaw a passage<br> through them, and on my way East.’<br> They had both got to their feet, and at this remark Kismine came close and put her arm through his.<br> ‘I'm going, too.’<br> ‘You must be crazy−−−−’<br> ‘Of course I'm going,’ she interrupted impatiently.<br> ‘You most certainly are not. You−−−−’<br> ‘Very well,’ she said quietly, ‘we'll catch up with father now and talk it over with him.’<br> Defeated, John mustered a sickly smile.<br> ‘Very well, dearest,’ he agreed, with pale and unconvincing affection, ‘we'll go together.’<br> His love for her returned and settled placidly on his heart. She was his−−she would go with him to share his<br> dangers. He put his arms about her and kissed her fervently. After all she loved him; she had saved him, in fact.<br> Discussing the matter, they walked slowly back toward the ch_teau. They decided that since Braddock<br> Washington had seen them together they had best depart the next night. Nevertheless, John's lips were unusually<br> dry at dinner, and he nervously emptied a great spoonful of peacock soup into his left lung. He had to be carried<br> into the turquoise and sable card−room and pounded on the back by one of the under−butlers, which Percy<br> considered a great joke.<br> IX<br> LONG AFTER midnight John's body gave a nervous jerk, and he sat suddenly upright, staring into the veils of<br> somnolence that draped the room. Through the squares of blue darkness that were his open windows, he had<br> heard a faint far−away sound that died upon a bed of wind before identifying itself on his memory, clouded with<br> uneasy dreams. But the sharp noise that had succeeded it was nearer, was just outside the room−−the click of a<br> turned knob, a footstep, a whisper, he could not tell; a hard lump gathered in the pit of his stomach, and his whole<br> body ached in the moment that he strained agonizingly to hear. Then one of the veils seemed to dissolve, and he<br> saw a vague figure standing by the door, a figure only faintly limned and blocked in upon the darkness, mingled<br> so with the folds of the drapery as to seem distorted, like a reflection seen in a dirty pane of glass.<br> With a sudden movement of fright or resolution John pressed the button by his bedside, and the next moment he<br> was sitting in the green sunken bath of the adjoining room, waked into alertness by the shock of the cold water<br> which half filled it.<br> He sprang out, and, his wet pajamas scattering a heavy trickle of water behind him, ran for the aquamarine door<br> which he knew led out onto the ivory landing of the second floor. The door opened noiselessly. A single crimson<br> lamp burning in a great dome above lit the magnificent sweep of the carved stairways with a poignant beauty. For<br> a moment John hesitated, appalled by the silent splendor massed about him, seeming to envelop in its gigantic<br> folds and contours the solitary drenched little figure shivering upon the ivory landing. Then simultaneously two<br> things happened. The door of his own sitting−room swung open, precipitating three naked negroes into the<br> hall−−and, as John swayed in wild terror toward the stairway, another door slid back in the wall on the other side<br> of the corridor, and John saw Braddock Washington standing in the lighted lift, wearing a fur coat and a pair of<br> riding boots which reached to his knees and displayed, above, the glow of his rose−colored pajamas.<br> On the instant the three negroes−−John had never seen any of them before, and it flashed through his mind that<br> they must be the professional executioners−−paused in their movement toward John, and turned expectantly to the<br> man in the lift, who burst out with an imperious command:<br> ‘Get in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!’<br> Then, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the oblong of light was blotted out as the lift door<br> slid shut, and John was again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory stair.<br> It was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something which, for the moment at least, had postponed<br> his own petty disaster. What was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of<br> the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the<br> gaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again, and then, a moment<br> later, as it descended. It was probable that Percy was hurrying to his father's assistance, and it occurred to John<br> that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and plan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been<br> silent for several minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped in through his wet pajamas, he<br> returned to his room and dressed himself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned down the<br> corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine's suite.<br> The door of her sitting−room was open and the lamps were lighted. Kismine, in an angora kimono, stood near the<br> window of the room in a listening attitude, and as John entered noiselessly she turned toward him.<br> ‘Oh, it's you!’ she whispered, crossing the room to him. ‘Did you hear them?’<br> ‘I heard your father's slaves in my−−−−’<br> ‘No,’ she interrupted excitedly. ‘Aeroplanes!’<br> ‘Aeroplanes? Perhaps that was the sound that woke me.’<br> ‘There're at least a dozen. I saw one a few moments ago dead against the moon. The guard back by the cliff fired<br> his rifle and that's what roused father. We're going to open on them right away.’<br> ‘Are they here on purpose?’<br> ‘Yes−−it's that Italian who got away−−−−’<br> Simultaneously with her last word, a succession of sharp cracks tumbled in through the open window. Kismine<br> uttered a little cry, took a penny with fumbling fingers from a box on her dresser, and ran to one of the electric<br> lights. In an instant the entire ch_teau was in darkness−−she had blown out the fuse.<br> ‘Come on!’ she cried to him. ‘We'll go up to the roof garden, and watch it from there!’<br> Drawing a cape about her, she took his hand, and they found their way out the door. It was only a step to the<br> tower lift, and as she pressed the button that shot them upward he put his arms around her in the darkness and<br> kissed her mouth. Romance had come to John Unger at last. A minute later they had stepped out upon the<br> star−white platform. Above, under the misty moon, sliding in and out of the patches of cloud that eddied below it,<br> floated a dozen dark−winged bodies in a constant circling course. From here and there in the valley flashes of fire<br> leaped toward them, followed by sharp detonations. Kismine clapped her hands with pleasure, which, a moment<br> later, turned to dismay as the aeroplanes at some prearranged signal, began to release their bombs and the whole<br> of the valley became a panorama of deep reverberate sound and lurid light.<br> Before long the aim of the attackers became concentrated upon the points where the anti−aircraft guns were<br> situated, and one of them was almost immediately reduced to a giant cinder to lie smouldering in a park of rose<br> bushes.<br> ‘Kismine,’ begged John, ‘you'll be glad when I tell you that this attack came on the eve of my murder. If I hadn't<br> heard that guard shoot off his gun back by the pass I should now be stone dead−−−−’<br> ‘I can't hear you!’ cried Kismine, intent on the scene before her. ‘You'll have to talk louder!’<br> ‘I simply said, ‘ shouted John, ‘that we'd better get out before they begin to shell the ch_teau!’<br> Suddenly the whole portico of the negro quarters cracked asunder, a geyser of flame shot up from under the<br> colonnades, and great fragments of jagged marble were hurled as far as the borders of the lake.<br> ‘There go fifty thousand dollars' worth of slaves,’ cried Kismine, ‘at prewar prices. So few Americans have any<br> respect for property.’<br> John renewed his efforts to compel her to leave. The aim of the aeroplanes was becoming more precise minute by<br> minute, and only two of the antiaircraft guns were still retaliating. It was obvious that the garrison, encircled with<br> fire, could not hold out much longer.<br> ‘Come on!’ cried John, pulling Kismine's arm, ‘we've got to go. Do you realize that those aviators will kill you<br> without question if they find you ?’<br> She consented reluctantly.<br> ‘We'll have to wake Jasmine!’ she said, as they hurried toward the lift. Then she added in a sort of childish<br> delight: ‘We'll be poor, won't we? Like people in books. And I'll be an orphan and utterly free. Free and poor!<br> What fun!’ She stopped and raised her lips to him in a delighted kiss.<br> ‘It's impossible to be both together,’ said John grimly. ‘People have found that out. And I should choose to be<br> free as preferable of the two. As an extra caution you'd better dump the contents of your jewel box into your<br> pockets.’<br> Ten minutes later the two girls met John in the dark corridor and they descended to the main floor of the ch_teau.<br> Passing for the last time through the magnificence of the splendid halls, they stood for a moment out on the<br> terrace, watching the burning negro quarters and the flaming embers of two planes which had fallen on the other<br> side of the lake. A solitary gun was still keeping up a sturdy popping, and the attackers seemed timorous about<br> descending lower, but sent their thunderous fireworks in a circle around it, until any chance shot might annihilate<br> its Ethiopian crew.<br> John and the two sisters passed down the marble steps, turned sharply to the left, and began to ascend a narrow<br> path that wound like a garter about the diamond mountain. Kismine knew a heavily wooded spot half−way up<br> where they could lie concealed and yet be able to observe the wild night in the valley−−finally to make an escape,<br> when it should be necessary, along a secret path laid in a rocky gully.<br> X<br> IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK when they attained their destination. The obliging and phlegmatic Jasmine fell off to<br> sleep immediately, leaning against the trunk of a large tree, while John and Kismine sat, his arm around her, and<br> watched the desperate ebb and flow of the dying battle among the ruins of a vista that had been a garden spot that<br> morning. Shortly after four o'clock the last remaining gun gave out a clanging sound and went out of action in a<br> swift tongue of red smoke. Though the moon was down, they saw that the flying bodies were circling closer to the<br> earth. When the planes had made certain that the beleaguered possessed no further resources, they would land and<br> the dark and glittering reign of the Washingtons would be over.<br> With the cessation of the firing the valley grew quiet. The embers of the two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes of<br> some monster crouching in the grass. The ch_teau stood dark and silent, beautiful without light as it had been<br> beautiful in the sun, while the woody rattles of Nemesis filled the air above with a growing and receding<br> complaint. Then John perceived that Kismine, like her sister, had fallen sound asleep.<br> It was long after four when he became aware of footsteps along the path they had lately followed, and he waited<br> in breathless silence until the persons to whom they belonged had passed the vantage−point he occupied. There<br> was a faint stir in the air now that was not of human origin, and the dew was cold; he knew that the dawn would<br> break soon. John waited until the steps had gone a safe distance up the mountain and were inaudible. Then he<br> followed. About half−way to the steep summit the trees fell away and a hard saddle of rock spread itself over the<br> diamond beneath. Just before he reached this point he slowed down his pace, warned by an animal sense that there<br> was life just ahead of him. Coming to a high boulder, he lifted his head gradually above its edge. His curiosity<br> was rewarded; this is what he saw:<br> Braddock Washington was standing there motionless, silhouetted against the gray sky without sound or sign of<br> life. As the dawn came up out of the east, lending a cold green color to the earth, it brought the solitary figure into<br> insignificant contrast with the new day.<br> While John watched, his host remained for a few moments absorbed in some inscrutable contemplation; then he<br> signalled to the two negroes who crouched at his feet to lift the burden which lay between them. As they struggled<br> upright, the first yellow beam of the sun struck through the innumerable prisms of an immense and exquisitely<br> chiselled diamond−−and a white radiance was kindled that glowed upon the air like a fragment of the morning<br> star. The bearers staggered beneath its weight for a moment−−then their rippling muscles caught and hardened<br> under the wet shine of the skins and the three figures were again motionless in their defiant impotency before the<br> heavens.<br> After a while the white man lifted his head and slowly raised his arms in a gesture of attention, as one who would<br> call a great crowd to hear−−but there was no crowd, only the vast silence of the mountain and the sky, broken by<br> faint bird voices down among the trees. The figure on the saddle of rock began to speak ponderously and with an<br> inextinguishable pride.<br> ‘You out there−−’ he cried in a trembling voice. ‘You−− there−−!’ He paused, his arms still uplifted, his head<br> held attentively as though he were expecting an answer. John strained his eyes to see whether there might be men<br> coming down the mountain, but the mountain was bare of human life. There was only sky and a mocking flute of<br> wind along the tree−tops. Could Washington be praying? For a moment John wondered. Then the illusion<br> passed−−there was something in the man's whole attitude antithetical to prayer.<br> ‘Oh, you above there!’<br> The voice was become strong and confident. This was no forlorn supplication. If anything, there was in it a<br> quality of monstrous condescension.<br> ‘You there−−−−’<br> Words, too quickly uttered to be understood, flowing one into the other. . . . John listened breathlessly, catching a<br> phrase here and there, while the voice broke off, resumed, broke off again−−now strong and argumentative, now<br> colored with a slow, puzzled impatience. Then a conviction commenced to dawn on the single listener, and as<br> realization crept over him a spray of quick blood rushed through his arteries. Braddock Washington was offering<br> a bribe to God!<br> That was it−−there was no doubt. The diamond in the arms of his slaves was some advance sample, a promise of<br> more to follow.<br> That, John perceived after a time, was the thread running through his sentences. Prometheus Enriched was calling<br> to witness forgotten sacrifices, forgotten rituals, prayers obsolete before the birth of Christ. For a while his<br> discourse took the form of reminding God of this gift or that which Divinity had deigned to accept from<br> men−−great churches if he would rescue cities from the plague, gifts of myrrh and gold, of human lives and<br> beautiful women and captive armies, of children and queens, of beasts of the forest and field, sheep and goats,<br> harvests and cities, whole conquered lands that had been offered up in lust or blood for His appeasal, buying a<br> meed's worth of alleviation from the Divine wrath−−and now he, Braddock Washington, Emperor of Diamonds,<br> king and priest of the age of gold, arbiter of splendor and luxury, would offer up a treasure such as princes before<br> him had never dreamed of, offer it up not in suppliance, but in pride.<br> He would give to God, he continued, getting down to specifications, the greatest diamond in the world. This<br> diamond would be cut with many more thousand facets than there were leaves on a tree, and yet the whole<br> diamond would be shaped with the perfection of a stone no bigger than a fly. Many men would work upon it for<br> many years. It would be set in a great dome of beaten gold, wonderfully carved and equipped with gates of opal<br> and crusted sapphire. In the middle would be hollowed out a chapel presided over by an altar of iridescent,<br> decomposing, ever−changing radium which would burn out the eyes of any worshipper who lifted up his head<br> from prayer−−and on this altar there would be slain for the amusement of the Divine Benefactor any victim He<br> should choose, even though it should be the greatest and most powerful man alive.<br> In return he asked only a simple thing, a thing that for God would be absurdly easy−−only that matters should be<br> as they were yesterday at this hour and that they should so remain. So very simple! Let but the heavens open,<br> swallowing these men and their aeroplanes−−and then close again. Let him have his slaves once more, restored to<br> life and well.<br> There was no one else with whom he had ever needed to treat or bargain.<br> He doubted only whether he had made his bribe big enough. God had His price, of course. God was made in<br> man's image, so it had been said: He must have His price. And the price would be rare−−no cathedral whose<br> building consumed many years, no pyramid constructed by ten thousand workmen, would be like this cathedral,<br> this pyramid.<br> He paused here. That was his proposition. Everything would be up to specifications and there was nothing vulgar<br> in his assertion that it would be cheap at the price. He implied that Providence could take it or leave it.<br> As he approached the end his sentences became broken, became short and uncertain, and his body seemed tense,<br> seemed strained to catch the slightest pressure or whisper of life in the spaces around him. His hair had turned<br> gradually white as he talked, and now he lifted his head high to the heavens like a prophet of old−−magnificently<br> mad.<br> Then, as John stared in giddy fascination, it seemed to him that a curious phenomenon took place somewhere<br> around him. It was as though the sky had darkened for an instant, as though there had been a sudden murmur in a<br> gust of wind, a sound of far−away trumpets, a sighing like the rustle of a great silken robe−−for a time the whole<br> of nature round about partook of this darkness; the birds' song ceased; the trees were still, and far over the<br> mountain there was a mutter of dull, menacing thunder.<br> That was all. The wind died along the tall grasses of the valley. The dawn and the day resumed their place in a<br> time, and the risen sun sent hot waves of yellow mist that made its path bright before it. The leaves laughed in the<br> sun, and their laughter shook the trees until each bough was like a girl's school in fairyland. God had refused to<br> accept the bribe.<br> For another moment John watched the triumph of the day. Then, turning he saw a flutter of brown down by the<br> lake, then another flutter, then another, like the dance of golden angels alighting from the clouds. The aeroplanes<br> had come to earth.<br> John slid off the boulder and ran down the side of the mountain to the clump of trees, where the two girls were<br> awake and waiting for him. Kismine sprang to her feet, the jewels in her pockets jingling, a question on her parted<br> lips, but instinct told John that there was no time for words. They must get off the mountain without losing a<br> moment. He seized a hand of each and in silence they threaded the tree−trunks, washed with light now and with<br> the rising mist. Behind them from the valley came no sound at all, except the complaint of the peacocks far away<br> and the pleasant undertone of morning.<br> When they had gone about half a mile, they avoided the park land and entered a narrow path that led over the next<br> rise of ground. At the highest point of this they paused and turned around. Their eyes rested upon the<br> mountainside they had just left−−oppressed by some dark sense of tragic impendency.<br> Clear against the sky a broken, white−haired man was slowly descending the steep slope, followed by two<br> gigantic and emotionless negroes, who carried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the sun.<br> Half−way down two other figures joined them−−John could see that they were Mrs. Washington and her son,<br> upon whose arm she leaned. The aviators had clambered from their machines to the sweeping lawn in front of the<br> ch_teau, and with rifles in hand were starting up the diamond mountain in skirmishing formation.<br> But the little group of five which had formed farther up and was engrossing all the watchers' attention had stopped<br> upon a ledge of rock. The negroes stooped and pulled up what appeared to be a trap−door in the side of the<br> mountain. Into this they all disappeared, the white−haired man first, then his wife and son, finally the two<br> negroes, the glittering tips of whose jeweled head−dresses caught the sun for a moment before the trap−door<br> descended and engulfed them all.<br> Kismine clutched John's arm.<br> ‘Oh,’ she cried wildly, ‘where are they going? What are they going to do?’<br> ‘It must be some underground way of escape ‘<br> A little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence.<br> ‘Don't you see?’ sobbed Kismine hysterically. ‘The mountain is wired!’<br> Even as she spoke John put up his hands to shield his sight. Before their eyes the whole surface of the mountain<br> had changed suddenly to a dazzling burning yellow, which showed up through the jacket of turf as light shows<br> through a human hand. For a moment the intolerable glow continued, and then like an extinguished filament it<br> disappeared, revealing a black waste from which blue smoke arose slowly, carrying off with it what remained of<br> vegetation and of human flesh. Of the aviators there was left neither blood, nor bone−−they were consumed as<br> completely as the five souls who had gone inside.<br> Simultaneously, and with an immense concussion, the ch_teau literally threw itself into the air, bursting into<br> flaming fragments as it rose, and then tumbling back upon itself in a smoking pile that lay projecting half into the<br> water of the lake. There was no fire−−what smoke there was drifted off mingling with the sunshine, and for a few<br> minutes longer a powdery dust of marble drifted from the great featureless pile that had once been the house of<br> jewels. There was no more sound and the three people were alone in the valley.<br> XI<br> AT SUNSET John and his two companions reached the high cliff which had marked the boundaries of the<br> Washingtons' dominion, and looking back found the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to<br> finish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket.<br> ‘There!’ she said, as she spread the table−cloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. ‘Don't they look<br> tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors.’<br> ‘With that remark,’ remarked Kismine, ‘Jasmine enters the middle class.’<br> ‘Now,’ said John eagerly, ‘turn out your pocket and let's see what jewels you brought along. If you made a good<br> selection we three ought to live comfortably all the rest of our lives.’<br> Obediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls of glittering stones before him.<br> ‘Not so bad,’ cried John, enthusiastically. ‘They aren't very big, but−− Hello!’ His expression changed as he held<br> one of them up to the declining sun. ‘Why, these aren't diamonds! There's something the matter!’<br> ‘By golly!’ exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. ‘What an idiot I am!’<br> ‘Why, these are rhinestones!’ cried John.<br> ‘I know.’ She broke into a laugh. ‘I opened the wrong drawer. They belonged on the dress of a girl who visited<br> Jasmine. I got her to give them to me in exchange for diamonds. I'd never seen anything but precious stones<br> before.’<br> ‘And this is what you brought?’<br> ‘I'm afraid so.’ She fingered the brilliants wistfully. ‘I think I like these better. I'm a little tired of diamonds.’<br> ‘Very well,’ said John gloomily. ‘We'll have to live in Hades. And you will grow old telling incredulous women<br> that you got the wrong drawer. Unfortunately your father's bank−books were consumed with him.’<br> ‘Well, what's the matter with Hades?’<br> ‘If I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as not to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say<br> down there.’<br> Jasmine spoke up.<br> ‘I love washing,’ she said quietly. ‘I have always washed my own handkerchiefs. I'll take in laundry and support<br> you both.’<br> ‘Do they have washwomen in Hades?’ asked Kismine innocently.<br> ‘Of course,’ answered John. ‘It's just like anywhere else.’<br> ‘I thought−−perhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes.’<br> John laughed.<br> ‘Just try it!’ he suggested. ‘They'll run you out before you're half started.’<br> ‘Will father be there?’ she asked.<br> John turned to her in astonishment.<br> ‘Your father is dead,’ he replied somberly. ‘Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place<br> that was abolished long ago.’<br> After supper they folded up the table−cloth and spread their blankets for the night.<br> ‘What a dream it was,’ Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. ‘How strange it seems to be here with one dress<br> and a penniless fianc_!<br> ‘Under the stars,’ she repeated. ‘I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds<br> that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth.’<br> ‘It was a dream,’ said John quietly. ‘Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.’<br> ‘How pleasant then to be insane!’<br> ‘So I'm told,’ said John gloomily. ‘I don't know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so,<br> you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world,<br> diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it.’<br> He shivered. ‘Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia. His was a great<br> sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.’<br> So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep.</p><br>The sunlight dripped over the house like golden paint over an art jar, and the freckling shadows here and there<br> only intensified the rigor of the bath of light. The Butterworth and Larkin houses flanking were intrenched behind<br> great stodgy trees; only the Happer house took the full sun, and all day long faced the dusty road−street with a<br> tolerant kindly patience. This was the city of Tarleton in southernmost Georgia, September afternoon.<br> Up in her bedroom window Sally Carrol Happer rested her nineteen−year−old chin on a fifty−two−year−old sill<br> and watched Clark Darrow's ancient Ford turn the corner. The car was hot−− being partly metallic it retained all<br> the heat it absorbed or evolved −− and Clark Darrow sitting bolt upright at the wheel wore a pained, strained<br> expression as though he considered himself a spare part, and rather likely to break. He laboriously crossed two<br> dust ruts, the wheels squeaking indignantly at the encounter, and then with a terrifying expression he gave the<br> steering−gear a final wrench and deposited self and car approximately in front of the Happer steps. There was a<br> plaintive heaving sound, a death−rattle, followed by a short silence; and then the air was rent by a startling<br> whistle.<br> Sally Carrol gazed down sleepily. She started to yawn, but finding this quite impossible unless she raised her chin<br> from the window−sill, changed her mind and continued silently to regard the car, whose owner sat brilliantly if<br> perfunctorily at attention as he waited for an answer to his signal. After a moment the whistle once more split the<br> dusty air.<br> ‘Good mawnin'.’<br> With difficulty Clark twisted his tall body round and bent a distorted glance on the window.<br> ‘'Tain't mawnin', Sally Carrol.’<br> ‘Isn't it, sure enough?’<br> ‘What you do in'?’<br> ‘Eatin' 'n apple.’<br> ‘Come on go swimmin'−− want to?’<br> ‘Reckon so.’<br> ‘How 'bout hurryin' up?’<br> ‘Sure enough.’<br> Sally Carrol sighed voluminously and raised herself with profound inertia from the floor, where she had been<br> occupied in alternately destroying parts of a green apple and painting paper tops for her younger sister. She<br> approached a mirror, regarded her expression with a pleassd and pleasant languor, dabbed two spots of rouge on<br> her lips and a grain of powder on her nose, and covered her bobbed corn−colored hair with a rose littered sun<br> bonnet. Then she kicked over the painting water, said, ‘Oh, damn!’ −− but let it lay−− and left the room.<br> ‘How you, Clark?’ she inquired a minute later as she slipped nimbly over the side of the car.<br> ‘Mighty fine, Sally Carrol.’<br> ‘Where we go swimmin'?’<br> ‘Out to Walley's pool. Told Marylyn we'd call by an' get her an' Joe Ewing.’<br> Clark was dark and lean, and when on foot was rather inclined to stoop. His eyes were ominous and his<br> expression somewhat petulant except when startlingly illuminated by one of his frequent smiles. Clark had ‘a<br> income’−− just enough to keep himself in ease and his car in gasolene−− and he had spent the two years since he<br> graduated from Georgia Tech in dozing round the lazy streets of his home town, discussing how he could best<br> invest his capital for an immediate fortune.<br> Hanging round he found not at all difficult; a crowd of little girls had grown up beautifully, the amazing Sally<br> Carrol foremost among them; and they enjoyed being swum with and danced with and made love to in the<br> flower−filled summery evenings −− and they all liked Clark immensely. When feminine company palled there<br> were half a dozen other youths who were always just about to do something, and meanwhile were quite willing to<br> join him in a few holes of golf, or a game of billiards, or the consumption of a quart of ‘hard yella licker.’ Every<br> once in a while one of these contemporaries made a farewell round of calls before going up to New York or<br> Philadelphia or Pittsburgh to go into business, but mostly they just stayed round in this languid parade of dreamy<br> skies and fireily evenings and noisy niggery street fairs−− and especially of gracious, soft−voiced girls, who were<br> brought up on memories instead of money.<br> The Ford having been excited into a sort of restless resentful life Clark and Sally Carrol rolled and rattled down<br> Valley Avenue into Jefferson Street, where the dust road became a pavement; along opiate Millicent Place, where<br> there were half a dozen prosperous, substantial mansions; and on into the down−town section. Driving was<br> perilous here, for it was shopping time; the population idled casually across the streets and a drove of<br> low−moaning oxen were being urged along in front of a placid street−car; even the shops seemed only yawning<br> their doors and blinking their windows in the sunshine before retiring into a state of utter and finite coma.<br> ‘Sally Carrol,’ said Clark suddenly, ‘it a fact that you're engaged?’<br> She looked at him quickly.<br> ‘Where'd you hear that?’<br> ‘Sure enough, you engaged?’<br> ‘'At's a nice question!’<br> ‘Girl told me you were engaged to a Yankee you met up in Asheville last summer.’<br> Sally Carrol sighed.<br> ‘Never saw such an old town for rumors.’<br> ‘Don't marry a Yankee, Sally Carrol. We need you round here.’<br> Sally Carrol was silent a moment.<br> ‘Clark,’ she demanded suddenly, ‘who on earth shall I marry?’<br> ‘I offer my services.’<br> ‘Honey, you couldn't support a wife,’ she answered cheerfully. ‘Anyway, I know you too well to fall in love with<br> you.’<br> ‘'At doesn't mean you ought to marry a Yankee,’ he persisted.<br> ‘S'pose I love him?’<br> He shook his head.<br> ‘You couldn't. He'd be a lot different from us, every way.’<br> He broke off as he halted the car in front of a rambling, dilapidated house. Marylyn Wade and Joe Ewing<br> appeared in the doorway.<br> ‘'Lo, Sally Carrol.’<br> ‘Hi!’<br> ‘How you−all?’<br> ‘ Sally Carrol,’ demanded Marylyn as they started off again, ‘you engaged?’<br> ‘Lawdy, where'd all this start? Can't I look at a man 'thout everybody in town engagin' me to him?’<br> Clark stared straight in front of him at a bolt on the clattering wind−shield.<br> ‘Sally Carrol,’ he said with a curious intensity, ‘don't you like us?’<br> ‘What?’<br> ‘Us down here?’<br> `Why, Clark, you know I do. I adore all you boys.’<br> ‘Then why you gettin' engaged to a Yankee?’<br> ‘Clark, I don't know. I'm not sure what I'll do,<br> but−− well, I want to go places and see people. I want my mind to grow. I want to live where things happen on a<br> big scale.’<br> ‘What you mean?’<br> ‘Oh, Clark, I love you, and I love Joe here, and Ben Arrot, and you−all, but you'll−− you'll−− −− ‘<br> ‘We'll all be failures?’<br> ‘Yes. I don't mean only money failures, but just sort of−− of ineffectual and sad, and−− oh, how can I tell you?’<br> ‘You mean because we stay here in Tarleton?’<br> ‘Yes, Clark; and because you like it and never want to change things or think or go ahead.’<br> He nodded and she reached over and pressed his hand.<br> ‘Clark,’ she said softly, ‘I wouldn't change you for the world. You're sweet the way you are. The things that'll<br> make you fail I'll love always−− the living in the past, the lazy days and nights you have, and all your carelessness<br> and generosity.’<br> ‘But you're goin' away?’<br> ‘Yes−− because I couldn't ever marry you. You've a place in my heart no one else ever could have, but tied down<br> here I'd get restless. I'd feel I was−− wastin' myself. There's two sides to me, you see. There's the sleepy old side<br> you love; an' there's a sort of energy−− the feelin' that makes me do wild things. That's the part of me that may be<br> useful somewhere, that'll last when I'm not beautiful any more.’<br> She broke off with characteristic suddenness and sighed, ‘Oh, sweet cooky!’ as her mood changed.<br> Half closing her eyes and tipping back her head till it rested on the seat−back she let the savory breeze fan her<br> eyes and ripple the fluffy curls of her bobbed hair. They were in the country now, hurrying between tangled<br> growths of bright−green coppice and grass and tall trees that sent sprays of foliage to hang a cool welcome over<br> the road. Here and there they passed a battered negro cabin, its oldest white−haired inhabitant smoking a corncob<br> pipe beside the door, and half a dozen scantily clothed pickaninnies parading tattered dolls on the wild−grown<br> grass in front. Farther out were lazy cotton−fields, where even the workers seemed intangible shadows lent by the<br> sun to the earth, not for toil, but to while away some age−old tradition in the golden September fields. And round<br> the drowsy picturesqueness, over the trees and shacks and muddy rivers, flowed the heat, never hostile, only<br> comforting, like a great warm nourishing bosom for the infant earth.<br> ‘Sally Carrol, we're here!’ ‘Poor chile's soun' asleep.’<br> ‘Honey, you dead at last out a sheer laziness?’<br> ‘Water, Sally Carrol! Cool water waitin' for you!’<br> Her eyes opened sleepily.<br> ‘Hi!’ she murmured, smiling.<br> II<br> In November Harry Bellamy, tall, broad, and brisk, came down from his Northern city to spend four days. His<br> intention was to settle a matter that had been hanging fire since he and Sally Carrol had met in Asheville, North<br> Carolina, in midsummer. The settlement took only a quiet afternoon and an evening in front of a glowing open<br> fire, for Harry Bellamy had everything she wanted; and, besides, she loved him−− loved him with that side of her<br> she kept especially for loving. Sally Carrol had several rather clearly defined sides.<br> On his last afternoon they walked, and she found their steps tending half−unconsciously toward one of her<br> favorite haunts, the cemetery. When it came in sight, gray−white and golden−green under the cheerful late sun,<br> she paused, irresolute, by the iron gate.<br> ‘Are you mournful by nature, Harry?’ she asked with a faint smile.<br> ‘Mournful? Not I.’<br> ‘Then let's go in here. It depresses some folks, but I like it.’<br> They passed through the gateway and followed a path that led through a wavy valley of graves−− dusty−gray and<br> mouldy for the fifties; quaintly carved with flowers and jars for the seventies; ornate and hideous for the nineties,<br> with fat marble cherubs lying in sodden sleep on stone pillows, and great impossible growths of nameless granite<br> flowers. Occasionally they saw a kneeling figure with tributary flowers, but over most of the graves lay silence<br> and withered leaves with only the fragrance that their own shadowy memories could waken in living minds.<br> They reached the top of a hill where they were fronted by a tall, round head−stone, freckled with dark spots of<br> damp and half grown over with vines.<br> ‘Margery Lee,’ she read; ‘1844−1873. Wasn't she nice? She died when she was twenty−nine. Dear Margery Lee,’<br> she added softly. ‘Can't you see her, Harry?’<br> ‘Yes, Sally Carrol.’<br> He felt a little hand insert itself into his.<br> ‘She was dark, I think; and she always wore her hair with a ribbon in it, and gorgeous hoop−skirts of alice blue<br> and old rose.’<br> ‘Yes.’<br> ‘Oh, she was sweet, Harry! And she was the sort of girl born to stand on a wide, pillared porch and welcome folks<br> in. I think perhaps a lot of men went away to war meanin' to come back to her; but maybe none of 'em ever did.’<br> He stooped down close to the stone, hunting for any record of marriage.<br> ‘There's nothing here to show.’<br> ‘Of course not. How could there be anything there better than just 'Margery Lee,' and that eloquent date?’<br> She drew close to him and an unexpected lump<br> came into his throat as her yellow hair brushed his cheek.<br> ‘You see how she was, don't you, Harry?’<br> ‘I see,’ he agreed gently. ‘I see through your precious eyes. You're beautiful now, so I know she must have been.’<br> Silent and close they stood, and he could feel her shoulders trembling a little. An ambling breeze swept up the hill<br> and stirred the brim of her floppidy<br> hat.<br> ‘Let's go down there!’<br> She was pointing to a flat stretch on the other side of the hill where along the green−turf were a thousand<br> grayish−white crosses stretching in endless, ordered rows like the stacked arms of a battalion.<br> ‘Those are the Confederate dead,’ said Sally Carrol simply.<br> They walked along and read the inscriptions, always only a name and a date, sometimes quite indecipherable.<br> ‘The last row is the saddest−− see, 'way over there. Every cross has just a date on it, and the word `Unknown.'‘<br> She looked at him and her eyes brimmed with tears.<br> ‘I can't tell you how real it is to me, darling−− if you don't know.’<br> ‘How you feel about it is beautiful to me.’<br> ‘No, no, it's not me, it's them−− that old time that I've tried to have live in me. These were just men, unimportant<br> evidently or they wouldn't have been `unknown'; but they died for the most beautiful thing in the world−− the<br> dead South. You see,’ she continued, her voice still husky, her eyes glistening with tears, ‘people have these<br> dreams they fasten onto things, and I've always grown up with that dream. It was so easy because it was all dead<br> and there weren't any disillusions comin' to me. I've tried in a way to live up to those past standards of noblesse<br> oblige−− there's just the last remnants of it, you know, like the roses of an old garden dying all round us−− streaks<br> of strange courtliness and chivalry in some of these boys an' stories I used to hear from a Confederate soldier who<br> lived next door, and a few old darkies. Oh, Harry, there was something, there was something! I couldn't ever<br> make you understand, but it was there.’<br> ‘I understand,’ he assured her again quietly.<br> Sally Carrol smiled and dried her eyes on the tip of a handkerchief protruding from his breast pocket.<br> ‘You don't feel depressed, do you, lover? Even when I cry I'm happy here, and I get a sort of strength from it.’<br> Hand in hand they turned and walked slowly away. Finding soft grass she drew him down to a seat beside her<br> with their backs against the remnants of a low broken wall.<br> ‘Wish those three old women would clear out,’ he complained. ‘I want to kiss you, Sally Carrol.’<br> ‘Me, too.’<br> They waited impatiently for the three bent figures to move off, and then she kissed him until the sky seemed to<br> fade out and all her smiles and tears to vanish in an ecstasy of eternal seconds.<br> Afterward they walked slowly back together, while on the corners twilight played at somnolent black−and−white<br> checkers with the end of day.<br> ‘You'll be up about mid−January,’ he said, ‘and you've got to stay a month at least. It'll be slick. There's a winter<br> carnival on, and if you've never really seen snow it'll be like fairy−land to you. There'll be skating and skiing and<br> tobogganing and sleigh−riding, and all sorts of torchlight parades on snow−shoes. They haven't had one for years,<br> so they're going to make it a knock−out.’<br> ‘Will I be cold, Harry?’ she asked suddenly.<br> ‘You certainly won't. You may freeze your nose, but you won't be shivery cold. It's hard and dry, you know.’<br> ‘I guess I'm a summer child. I don't like any cold I've ever seen.’<br> She broke off and they were both silent for a minute.<br> ‘Sally Carrol,’ he said very slowly, ‘what do you say to−− March?’<br> ‘I say I love you.’<br> ‘March?’<br> ‘March, Harry.’<br> III<br> All night in the Pullman it was very cold. She rang for the porter to ask for another blanket, and when he couldn't<br> give her one she tried vainly, by squeezing down into the bottom of her berth and doubling back the bedclothes, to<br> snatch a few hours' sleep. She wanted to look her best in the morning.<br> She rose at six and sliding uncomfortably into her clothes stumbled up to the diner for a cup of coffee. The snow<br> had filtered into the vestibules and covered the floor with a slippery coating. It was intriguing, this cold, it crept in<br> everywhere. Her breath was quite visible and she blew into the air with a nave enjoyment. Seated in the diner she<br> stared out the window at white hills and valleys and scattered pines whose every branch was a green platter for a<br> cold feast of snow. Sometimes a solitary farmhouse would fly by, ugly and bleak and lone on the white waste; and<br> with each one she had an instant of chill compassion for the souls shut in there waiting for spring.<br> As she left the diner and swayed back into the Pullman she experienced a surging rush of energy and wondered if<br> she was feeling the bracing air of which Harry had spoken. This was the North, the North−− her land now!<br> ‘Then blow, ye winds, heigho!<br> A−roving I will go,’<br> she chanted exultantly to herself.<br> ‘What's 'at?’ inquired the porter politely.<br> ‘I said: `Brush me off.'‘<br> The long wires of the telegraph−poles doubled; two tracks ran up beside the train−− three−− four; came a<br> succession of white−roofed houses, a glimpse of a trolley−car with frosted windows, streets−− more streets−− the<br> city.<br> She stood for a dazed moment in the frosty station before she saw three fur−bundled figures descending upon her.<br> ‘There she is!’<br> ‘Oh, Sally Carrol!’<br> Sally Carrol dropped her bag.<br> ‘Hi!’<br> A faintly familiar icy−cold face kissed her, and then she was in a group of faces all apparently emitting great<br> clouds of heavy smoke; she was shaking hands. There were Gordon, a short, eager man of thirty who looked like<br> an amateur knocked−about model for Harry, and his wife, Myra, a listless lady with flaxen hair under a fur<br> automobile cap. Almost immediately Sally Carrol thought of her as vaguely Scandinavian. A cheerful chauffeur<br> adopted her bag, and amid ricochets of half−phrases, exclamations, and perfunctory listless ‘my dears’ from<br> Myra, they swept each other from the station.<br> Then they were in a sedan bound through a crooked succession of snowy streets where dozens of little boys were<br> hitching sleds behind grocery wagons and automobiles.<br> ‘Oh,’ cried Sally Carrol, ‘I want to do that! Can we, Harry?’<br> ‘That's for kids. But we might−− −− ‘<br> ‘It looks like such a circus ‘ she said regretfully.<br> Home was a rambling frame house set on a white lap of snow, and there she met a big, gray−haired man of whom<br> she approved, and a lady who was like an egg, and who kissed her−− these were Harry's parents. There was a<br> breathless indescribable hour crammed full of half−sentences, hot water, bacon and eggs and confusion; and after<br> that she was alone with Harry in the library, asking him if she dared smoke.<br> It was a large room with a Madonna over the fireplace and rows upon rows of books in covers of light gold and<br> dark gold and shiny red. All the chairs had little lace squares where one's head should rest, the couch was just<br> comfortable, the books looked as if they had been read−− some−− and Sally Carrol had an instantaneous vision of<br> the battered old library at home, with her father's huge medical books, and the oil−paintings of her three<br> great−uncles, and the old couch that had been mended up for forty−five years and was still luxurious to dream in.<br> This room struck her as being neither attractive nor particularly otherwise. It was simply a room with a lot of<br> fairly expensive things in it that all looked about fifteen years old.<br> ‘What do you think of it up here?’ demanded Harry eagerly. ‘Does it surprise you? Is it what you expected, I<br> mean?’<br> ‘You are, Harry,’ she said quietly, and reached out her arms to him.<br> But after a brief kiss he seemed anxious to extort enthusiasm from her.<br> ‘The town, I mean. Do you like it? Can you feel the pep in the air?’<br> ‘Oh, Harry,’ she laughed, ‘you'll have to give me time. You can't just fling questions at me.’<br> She puffed at her cigarette with a sigh of contentment.<br> ‘One thing I want to ask you,’ he began rather apologetically; ‘you Southerners put quite an emphasis on family,<br> and all that−− not that it isn't quite all right, but you'll find it a little different here. I mean−− you'll notice a lot of<br> things that'll seem to you sort of vulgar display at first, Sally Carrol; but just remember that this is a<br> three−generation town. Everybody has a father, and about half of us have grandfathers. Back of that we don't go.’<br> ‘Of course,’ she murmured.<br> ‘Our grandfathers, you see, founded the place, and a lot of them had to take some pretty queer jobs while they<br> were doing the founding. For instance, there's one woman who at present is about the social model for the town;<br> well, her father was the first public ash man−− things like that.’<br> ‘Why,’ said Sally Carrol, puzzled, ‘did you s'pose I was goin' to make remarks about people?’<br> ‘Not at all,’ interrupted Harry; ‘and I'm not apologizing for any one either. It's just that−− well, a Southern girl<br> came up here last summer and said some unfortunate things, and−− oh, I just thought I'd tell you.’<br> Sally Carrol felt suddenly indignant−− as though she had been unjustly spanked−− but Harry evidently considered<br> the subject closed, for he went on with a great surge of enthusiasm.<br> ‘It's carnival time, you know. First in ten years. And there's an ice palace they're building now that's the first<br> they've had since eighty−five. Built out of blocks of the clearest ice they could find−− on a tremendous scale.’<br> She rose and walking to the window pushed aside the heavy Turkish portires and looked out.<br> ‘Oh!’ she cried suddenly. ‘There's two little boys makin' a snow man! Harry, do you reckon I can go out an' help<br> 'em?’<br> ‘You dream! Come here and kiss me.’<br> She left the window rather reluctantly.<br> ‘I don't guess this is a very kissable climate, is it? I mean, it makes you so you don't want to sit round, doesn't it?’<br> ‘We're not going to. I've got a vacation for the first week you're here, and there's a dinner−dance to−night.’<br> ‘Oh, Harry,’ she confessed, subsiding in a heap, half in his lap, half in the pillows, ‘I sure do feel confused. I<br> haven't got an idea whether I'll like it or not, an' I don't know what people expect, or anythin'. You'll have to tell<br> me, honey.’<br> ‘I'll tell you,’ he said softly, ‘if you'll just tell me you're glad to be here.’<br> ‘Glad−− just awful glad!’ she whispered, insinuating herself into his arms in her own peculiar way. ‘Where you<br> are is home for me, Harry.’<br> And as she said this she had the feeling for almost the first time in her life that she was acting a part.<br> That night, amid the gleaming candles of a dinner−party, where the men seemed to do most of the talking while<br> the girls sat in a haughty and expensive aloofness, even Harry's presence on her left failed to make her feel at<br> home.<br> ‘They're a good−looking crowd, don't you think?’ he demanded. ‘Just look round. There's Spud Hubbard, tackle<br> at Princeton last year, and Junie Morton−− he and the red−haired fellow next to him were both Yale hockey<br> captains; Junie was in my class. Why, the best athletes in the world come from these States round here. This is a<br> man's country, I tell you. Look at John J. Fishburn!’<br> ‘Who's he?’ asked Sally Carol innocently.<br> ‘Don't you know?’<br> ‘I've heard the name.’<br> ‘Greatest wheat man in the Northwest, and one of the greatest financiers in the country.’<br> She turned suddenly to a voice on her right.<br> ‘I guess they forgot to introduce us. My name's Roger Patton.’<br> ‘My name is Sally Carol Happer,’ she said graciously.<br> ‘Yes, I know. Harry told me you were coming.’<br> ‘You a relative?’<br> ‘No, I'm a professor.’<br> ‘Oh,’ she laughed.<br> ‘At the university. You're from the South, aren't you?’<br> ‘Yes; Tarleton, Georgia.’<br> She liked him immediately−− a reddish−brown mustache under watery blue eyes that had something in them that<br> these other eyes lacked, some quality of appreciation. They exchanged stray sentences through dinner, and she<br> made up her mind to see him again.<br> After coffee she was introduced to numerous good−looking young men who danced with conscious precision and<br> seemed to take it for granted that she wanted to talk about nothing except Harry.<br> ‘Heavens,’ she thought, ‘they talk as if my being engaged made me older than they are−− as if I'd tell their<br> mothers on them!’<br> In the South an engaged girl, even a young married woman, expected the same amount of half−affectionate<br> badinage and flattery that would be accorded a dbutante, but here all that seemed banned. One young man, after<br> getting well started on the subject of Sally Carrol's eyes, and how they had allured him ever since she entered the<br> room, went into a violent confusion when he found she was visiting the Bellamys−− was Harry's fiance. He<br> seemed to feel as though he had made some risque and inexcusable blunder, became immediately formal, and left<br> her at the first opportunity.<br> She was rather glad when Roger Patton cut in on her and suggested that they sit out a while.<br> ‘Well,’ he inquired, blinking cheerily, ‘how's Carmen from the South?’<br> ‘Mighty fine. How's−− how's Dangerous Dan<br> McGrew? Sorry, but he's the only Northerner I know much about.’<br> He seemed to enjoy that.<br> ‘Of course,’ he confessed, ‘as a professor of literature I'm not supposed to have read Dangerous Dan McGrew.’<br> ‘Are you a native?’<br> ‘No, I'm a Philadelphian. Imported from Harvard to teach French. But I've been here ten years.’<br> ‘Nine years, three hundred and sixty−four days longer than me.’<br> ‘Like it here?’<br> ‘Uh−huh. Sure do!’<br> ‘Really?’<br> ‘Well, why not? Don't I look as if I were havin' a good time?’<br> ‘I saw you look out the window a minute ago−− and shiver.’<br> ‘Just my imagination,’ laughed Sally Carrol. ‘I'm used to havin' everythin' quiet outside, an' sometimes I look out<br> an' see a flurry of snow, an' it's just as if somethin' dead was movin'.’<br> He nodded appreciatively.<br> ‘Ever been North before?’<br> ‘Spent two Julys in Asheville, North Carolina.’<br> ‘Nice−looking crowd, aren't they?’ suggested Patton, indicating the swirling floor.<br> Sally Carrol started. This had been Harry's remark.<br> ‘Sure are! They're−− canine.’<br> ‘What?’<br> She flushed.<br> ‘I'm sorry; that sounded worse than I meant it. You see I always think of people as feline or canine, irrespective of<br> sex.’<br> ‘Which are you?’<br> ‘I'm feline. So are you. So are most Southern men an' most of these girls here.’<br> ‘What's Harry?’<br> ‘Harry's canine distinctly. All the men I've met to−night seem to be canine.’<br> ‘What does `canine' imply? A certain conscious masculinity as opposed to subtlety?’<br> ‘Reckon so. I never analyzed it−− only I just look at people an' say `canine' or `feline' right off. It's right absurd, I<br> guess.’<br> ‘Not at all. I'm interested. I used to have a theory about these people. I think they're freezing up.’<br> ‘What?’<br> ‘I think they're growing like Swedes−− Ibsenesque, you know. Very gradually getting gloomy and melancholy.<br> It's these long winters. Ever read any Ibsen?’<br> She shook her head.<br> ‘Well, you find in his characters a certain brooding rigidity. They're righteous, narrow, and cheerless, without<br> infinite possibilities for great sorrow or joy.’<br> ‘Without smiles or tears?’<br> ‘Exactly. That's my theory. You see there are thousands of Swedes up here. They come, I imagine, because the<br> climate is very much like their own, and there's been a gradual mingling. There're probably not half a dozen here<br> to−night, but−− we've had four Swedish governors. Am I boring you?'<br> ‘I'm mighty interested.’<br> ‘Your future sister−in−law is half Swedish. Personally I like her, but my theory is that Swedes react rather badly<br> on us as a whole. Scandinavians, you know, have the largest suicide rate in the world.’<br> ‘Why do you live here if it's so depressing?’<br> ‘Oh, it doesn't get me. I'm pretty well cloistered, and I suppose, books mean more than people to me anyway.’<br> ‘But writers all speak about the South being tragic. You know−− Spanish seoritas, black hair and daggers an'<br> haunting music.’<br> He shook his head.<br> ‘No, the Northern races are the tragic races−− they don't indulge in the cheering luxury of tears.’<br> Sally Carrol thought of her graveyard. She supposed that that was vaguely what she had meant when she said it<br> didn't depress her.<br> ‘The Italians are about the gayest people in the world−− but it's a dull subject,’ he broke off. ‘Anyway, I want to<br> tell you you're marrying a pretty fine man.’<br> Sally Carrol was moved by an impulse of confidence.<br> ‘I know. I'm the sort of person who wants to be taken care of after a certain point, and I feel sure I will be.’<br> ‘Shall we dance? You know,’ he continued as they rose, ‘it's encouraging to find a girl who knows what she's<br> marrying for. Nine−tenths of them think of it as a sort of walking into a moving−picture sunset.’<br> She laughed, and liked him immensely.<br> Two hours later on the way home she nestled near Harry in the back seat.<br> ‘Oh, Harry,’ she whispered, ‘it's so co−old!’<br> ‘But it's warm in here, darling girl.’<br> ‘But outside it's cold; and oh, that howling wind!’<br> She buried her face deep in his fur coat and trembled involuntarily as his cold lips kissed the tip of her ear.<br> IV<br> The first week of her visit passed in a whirl. She had her promised toboggan−ride at the back of an automobile<br> through a chill January twilight. Swathed in furs she put in a morning tobogganing on the country−club hill; even<br> tried skiing, to sail through the air for a glorious moment and then land in a tangled laughing bundle on a soft<br> snowdrift. She liked all the winter sports, except an afternoon spent snow−shoeing over a glaring plain under pale<br> yellow sunshine, but she soon realized that these things were for children−− that she was being humored and that<br> the enjoyment round her was only a reflection of her own.<br> At first the Bellamy family puzzled her. The men were reliable and she liked them; to Mr. Bellamy especially,<br> with his iron−gray hair and energetic dignity, she took an immediate fancy, once she found that he was born in<br> Kentucky; this made of him a link between the old life and the new. But toward the women she felt a definite<br> hostility. Myra, her future sister−in−law, seemed the essence of spiritless conventionality. Her conversation was<br> so utterly devoid of personality that Sally Carrol, who came from a country where a certain amount of charm and<br> assurance could be taken for granted in the women, was inclined to despise her.<br> ‘If those women aren't beautiful,’ she thought, ‘they're nothing. They just fade out when you look at them.<br> They're glorified domestics. Men are the centre of every mixed group.’<br> Lastly there was Mrs. Bellamy, whom Sally Carrol detested. The first day's impression of an egg had been<br> confirmed−− an egg with a cracked, veiny voice and such an ungracious dumpiness of carriage that Sally Carrol<br> felt that if she once fell she would surely scramble. In addition, Mrs. Bellamy seemed to typify the town in being<br> innately hostile to strangers. She called Sally Carrol ‘Sally,’ and could not be persuaded that the double name was<br> anything more than a tedious ridiculous nickname. To Sally Carrol this shortening of her name was like<br> presenting her to the public half clothed. She loved ‘Sally Carrol’; she loathed ‘Sally.’ She knew also that Harry's<br> mother dispproved of her bobbed hair; and she had never dared smoke down−stairs after that first day when Mrs.<br> Bellamy had come into the library sniffing violently.<br> Of all the men she met she preferred Roger Patton, who was a frequent visitor at the house. He never again<br> alluded to the Ibsenesque tendency of the populace, but when he came in one day and found her curled upon the<br> sofa bent over ‘Peer Gynt’ he laughed and told her to forget what he'd said−− that it was all rot.<br> And then one afternoon in her second week she and Harry hovered on the edge of a dangerously steep quarrel.<br> She considered that he precipitated it entirely, though the Serbia in the case was an unknown man who had not<br> had his trousers pressed.<br> They had been walking homeward between mounds of high−piled snow and under a sun which Sally Carrol<br> scarcely recognized. They passed a little girl done up in gray wool until she resembled a small Teddy bear, and<br> Sally Carrol could not resist a gasp of maternal appreciation.<br> ‘Look! Harry!’<br> ‘What?’<br> ‘That little girl−− did you see her face?’<br> ‘Yes, why?’<br> ‘It was red as a little strawberry. Oh, she was cute!’<br> ‘Why, your own face is almost as red as that already! Everybody's healthy here. We're out in<br> the cold as soon as we're old enough to walk. Wonderful climate!’<br> She looked at him and had to agree. He was mighty healthy−looking; so was his brother. And she had noticed the<br> new red in her own cheeks that very morning.<br> Suddenly their glances were caught and held, and they stared for a moment at the street−corner ahead of them. A<br> man was standing there, his knees bent, his eyes gazing upward with a tense expression as though he were about<br> to make a leap toward the chilly sky. And then they both exploded into a shout of laughter, for coming closer they<br> discovered it had been a ludicrous momentary illusion produced by the extreme bagginess of the man's trousers.<br> ‘Reckon that's one on us,’ she laughed.<br> ‘He must be a Southerner, judging by those trousers,’ suggested Earry mischievously.<br> ‘Why, Harry!’<br> Her surprised look must have irritated him.<br> ‘Those damn Southerners!’<br> Sally Carrol's eyes flashed.<br> ‘Don't call 'em that!’<br> ‘I'm sorry, dear,’ said Harry, malignantly apologetic, ‘but you know what I think of them. They're sort of−− sort<br> of degenerates−− not at all like the old Southerners. They've lived so long down there with all the colored people<br> that they've gotten lazy and shiftless.’<br> ‘Hush your mouth, Harry!’ she cried angrily.<br> ‘They're not! They may be lazy−− anybody would be in that climate−− but they're my best friends, an' I don't<br> want to hear 'em criticised in any such sweepin' way. Some of 'em are the finest men in the world.’<br> ‘Oh, I know. They're all right when they come North to college, but of all the hangdog, ill−dressed, slovenly lot I<br> ever saw, a hunch of small−town Southerners are the worst!’<br> Sally Carrol was clinching her gloved hands and biting her lip furiously.<br> ‘Why,’ continued Harry, ‘there was one in my class at New Haven, and we all thought that at last we'd found the<br> true type of Southern aristocrat, but it turned out that he wasn't an aristocrat at all −− just the son of a Northern<br> carpetbagger, who owned about all the cotton round Mobile.’<br> ‘A Southerner wouldn't talk the way you're talking now,’ she said evenly.<br> ‘They haven't the energy!’<br> ‘Or the somethin' else.’<br> ‘I'm sorry, Sally Carrol, but I've heard you say yourself that you'd never marry−− −− ‘<br> ‘That's quite different. I told you I wouldn't want to tie my life to any of the boys that are round Tarleton now, but<br> I never made any sweepin' generalities.’<br> They walked along in silence.<br> ‘I probably spread it on a bit thick, Sally Carrol. I'm sorry.’<br> She nodded but made no answer. Five minutes later as they stood in the hallway she suddenly threw her arms<br> round him.<br> ‘Oh, Harry,’ she cried, her eyes brimming with tears, ‘let's get married next week. I'm afraid of having fusses like<br> that. I'm afraid, Harry. It wouldn't be that way if we were married.’<br> But Harry, being in the wrong, was still irritated.<br> ‘That'd be idiotic. We decided on March.’<br> The tears in Sally Carrol's eyes faded; her expression hardened slightly.<br> ‘Very well−− I suppose I shouldn't have said that.’<br> Harry melted.<br> ‘Dear little nut!’ he cried. ‘Come and kiss me and let's forget.’<br> That very night at the end of a vaudeville performance the orchestra played ‘Dixie’ and Sally Carrol felt<br> something stronger and more enduring than her tears and smiles of the day brim up inside her. She leaned forward<br> gripping the arms of her chair until her face grew crimson.<br> ‘Sort of get you, dear?’ whispered Harry.<br> But she did not hear him. To the spirited throb of the violins and the inspiring beat of the kettledrums her own old<br> ghosts were marching by and on into the darkness, and as fifes whistled and sighed in the low encore they seemed<br> so nearly out of sight that she could have waved good−by.<br> ‘Away, Away,<br> Away down South in Dixie!<br> Away, away,<br> Away down South in Dixie!’<br> V<br> It was a particularly cold night. A sudden thaw had nearly cleared the streets the day before, but now they were<br> traversed again with a powdery wraith of loose snow that travelled in wavy lines before the feet of the wind, and<br> filled the lower air with a fine−particled mist. There was no sky−− only a dark, ominous tent that draped in the<br> tops of the streets and was in reality a vast approaching army of snowflakes−− while over it all, chilling away the<br> comfort from the brown−and−green glow of lighted windows and muffling the steady trot of the horse pulling<br> their sleigh, interminably washed the north wind. It was a dismal town after all, she thought−− dismal.<br> Sometimes at night it had seemed to her as though no one lived here−− they had all gone long ago−− leaving<br> lighted houses to be covered in time by tombing heaps of sleet. Oh, if there should be snow on her grave! To be<br> beneath great piles of it all winter long, where even her headstone would be a light shadow against light shadows.<br> Her grave−− a grave that should be flower−strewn and washed with sun and rain.<br> She thought again of those isolated country houses that her train had passed, and of the life there the long winter<br> through−− the ceaseless glare through the windows, the crust forming on the soft drifts of snow, finally the slow,<br> cheerless melting, and the harsh spring of which Roger Patton had told her. Her spring−− to lose it forever−− with<br> its lilacs and the lazy sweetness it stirred in her heart. She was laying away that spring−− afterward she would lay<br> away that sweetness.<br> With a gradual insistence the storm broke. Sally Carrol felt a film of flakes melt quickly on her eyelashes, and<br> Harry reached over a furry arm and drew down her complicated flannel cap. Then the small flakes came in<br> skirmish−line, and the horse bent his neck patiently as a transparency of white appeared momentarily on his coat.<br> ‘Oh, he's cold, Harry,’ she said quickly.<br> ‘Who? The horse? Oh, no, he isn't. He likes it!’<br> After another ten minutes they turned a corner and came in sight of their destination. On a tall hill outlined in<br> vivid glaring green against the wintry sky stood the ice palace. It was three stories in the air, with battlements and<br> embrasures and narrow icicled windows, and the innumerable electric lights inside made a gorgeous transparency<br> of the great central hall. Sally Carrol clutched Harry's hand under the fur robe.<br> ‘It's beautiful!’ he cried excitedly. ‘My golly, it's beautiful, isn't it! They haven't had one here since eighty−five!’<br> Somehow the notion of there not having been one since eighty−five oppressed her. Ice was a ghost, and this<br> mansion of it was surely peopled by those shades of the eighties, with pale faces and blurred snow−filled hair.<br> ‘Come on, dear,’ said Harry.<br> She followed him out of the sleigh and waited while he hitched the horse. A party of four−− Gordon, Myra, Roger<br> Patton, and another girl−− drew up beside them with a mighty jingle of bells. There were quite a crowd already,<br> bundled in fur or sheepskin, shouting and calling to each other as they moved through the snow, which was now<br> so thick that people could scarcely be distinguished a few yards away.<br> ‘It's a hundred and seventy feet tall,’ Harry was saying to a muffled figure beside him as they trudged toward the<br> entrance; ‘covers six thousand square yards.’<br> She caught snatches of conversation: ‘One main hall’−− ‘walls twenty to forty inches thick’−− ‘and the ice cave<br> has almost a mile of−− ‘−− ‘this Canuck who built it−− −− ‘<br> They found their way inside, and dazed by the magic of the great crystal walls Sally Carrol found herself<br> repeating over and over two lines from ‘Kubla Khan’:<br> ‘It was a miracle of rare device,<br> A sunny pleasure−dome with caves of ice!’<br> In the great glittering cavern with the dark shut out she took a seat on a wooden bench, and the evening's<br> oppression lifted. Harry was right−− it was beautiful; and her gaze travelled the smooth surface of the walls, the<br> blocks for which had been selected for their purity and clearness to obtain this opalescent, translucent effect.<br> ‘Look! Here we go−− oh, boy!’ cried Harry.<br> A band in a far corner struck up ‘Hail, Hail, the Gang's All Here!’ which echoed over to them in wild muddled<br> acoustics, and then the lights suddenly went out; silence seemed to flow down the icy sides and sweep over them.<br> Sally Carrol could still see her white breath in the darkness, and a dim row of pale faces over on the other side.<br> The music eased to a sighing complaint, and from outside drifted in the full−throated resonant chant of the<br> marching clubs. It grew louder like some pan of a viking tribe traversing an ancient wild; it swelled−− they were<br> coming nearer; then a row of torches appeared, and another and another, and keeping time with their moccasined<br> feet a long column of gray−mackinawed figures swept in, snowshoes slung at their shoulders, torches soaring and<br> flickering as their voices rose along the great walls.<br> The gray column ended and another followed, the light streaming luridly this time over red toboggan caps and<br> flaming crimson mackinaws, and as they entered they took up the refrain; then came a long platoon of blue and<br> white, of green, of white, of brown and yellow.<br> ‘Those white ones are the Wacouta Club,’ whispered Harry eagerly. ‘Those are the men you've met round at<br> dances.’<br> The volume of the voices grew; the great cavern was a phantasmagoria of torches waving in great banks of fire, of<br> colors and the rhythm of soft−leather steps. The leading column turned and halted, platoon deployed in front of<br> platoon until the whole procession made a solid flag of flame, and then from thousands of voices burst a mighty<br> shout that filled the air like a crash of thunder, and sent the torches wavering. It was magnificent, it was<br> tremendous! To Sally Carrol it was the North offering sacrifice on some mighty altar to the gray pagan God of<br> Snow. As the shout died the band struck up again and there came more singing, and then long reverberating<br> cheers by each club. She sat very quiet listening while the staccato cries rent the stillness; and then she started, for<br> there was a volley of explosion, and great clouds of smoke went up here and there through the cavern−− the<br> flash−light photographers at work−− and the council was over. With the band at their head the clubs formed in<br> column once more, took up their chant, and began to march out.<br> ‘Come on!’ shouted Harry. ‘We want to see the labyrinths down−stairs before they turn the lights off!’<br> They all rose and started toward the chute−− Harry and Sally Carrol in the lead, her little mitten buried in his big<br> fur gantlet. At the bottom of the chute was a long empty room of ice, with the ceiling so low that they had to<br> stoop−− and their hands were parted. Before she realized what he intended Harry had darted down one of the<br> half−dozen glittering passages that opened into the room and was only a vague receding blot against the green<br> shimmer.<br> ‘Harry!’ she called.<br> ‘Come on!’ he cried back.<br> She looked round the empty chamber; the rest of the party had evidently decided to go home, were already<br> outside somewhere in the blundering snow. She hesitated and then darted in after Harry.<br> ‘Harry!’ she shouted.<br> She had reached a turning−point thirty feet down; she heard a faint muffled answer far to the left, and with a<br> touch of panic fled toward it. She passed another turning, two more yawning alleys.<br> ‘Harry!’<br> No answer. She started to run straight forward, and then turned like lightning and sped back the way she had<br> come, enveloped in a sudden icy terror.<br> She reached a turn−− was it here?−− took the left and came to what should have been the outlet into the long, low<br> room, but it was only another glittering passage with darkness at the end. She called again, but the walls gave<br> back a flat, lifeless echo with no reverberations. Retracing her steps she turned another corner, this time following<br> a wide passage. It was like the green lane between the parted waters of the Red Sea, like a damp vault connecting<br> empty tombs.<br> She slipped a little now as she walked, for ice had formed on the bottom of her overshoes; she had to run her<br> gloves along the half−slippery, half−sticky walls to keep her balance.<br> ‘Harry!’<br> Still no answer. The sound she made bounced mockingly down to the end of the passage.<br> Then on an instant the lights went out, and she was in complete darkness. She gave a small, frightened cry, and<br> sank down into a cold little heap on the ice. She felt her left knee do something as she fell, but she scarcely<br> noticed it as some deep terror far greater than any fear of being lost settled upon her. She was alone with this<br> presence that came out of the North, the dreary loneliness that rose from ice−bound whalers in the Arctic seas,<br> from smokeless, trackless wastes where were strewn the whitened bones of adventure. It was an icy breath of<br> death; it was rolling down low across the land to clutch at her.<br> With a furious, despairing energy she rose again and started blindly down the darkness. She must get out. She<br> might be lost in here for days, freeze to death and lie embedded in the ice like corpses she had read of, kept<br> perfectly preserved until the melting of a glacier. Harry probably thought she had left with the others−− he had<br> gone by now; no one would know until late next day. She reached pitifully for the wall. Forty inches thick, they<br> had said−− forty inches thick!<br> ‘Oh!’<br> On both sides of her along the walls she felt things creeping, damp souls that haunted this palace, this town, this<br> North.<br> ‘Oh, send somebody−− send somebody!’ she cried aloud.<br> Clark Darrow−− he would understand; or Joe Ewing; she couldn't be left here to wander forever −− to be frozen,<br> heart, body, and soul. This her−− this Sally Carrol! Why, she was a happy thing. She was a happy little girl. She<br> liked warmth and summer and Dixie. These things were foreign−− foreign.<br> ‘You're not crying,’ something said aloud.<br> ‘You'll never cry any more. Your tears would just freeze; all tears freeze up here!’<br> She sprawled full length on the ice.<br> ‘Oh, God!’ she faltered.<br> A long single file of minutes went by, and with a great weariness she felt her eyes closing. Then some one seemed<br> to sit down near here and take her face in warm, soft hands. She looked up gratefully.<br> ‘Why, it's Margery Lee,’ she crooned softly to herself. ‘I knew you'd come.’ It really was Margery Lee, and she<br> was just as Sally Carrol had known she would be, with a young, white brow, and wide, welcoming eyes, and a<br> hoop−skirt of some soft material that was quite comforting to rest on.<br> ‘Margery Lee.’<br> It was getting darker now and darker−− all those tombstones ought to be repainted, sure enough, only that would<br> spoil 'em, of course. Still, you ought to be able to see 'em.<br> Then after a succession of moments that went fast and then slow, but seemed to be ultimately resolving<br> themselves into a multitude of blurred rays converging toward a pale−yellow sun, she heard a great cracking noise<br> break her new−found stillness.<br> It was the sun, it was a light; a torch, and a torch beyond that, and another one, and voices; a face took flesh below<br> the torch, heavy arms raised her, and she felt something on her cheek−− it felt wet. Some one had seized her and<br> was rubbing her face with snow. How ridiculous−− with snow!<br> ‘Sally Carrol! Sally Carrol!<br> It was Dangerous Dan McGrew; and two other faces she didn't know.<br> ‘Child, child! We've been looking for you two<br> hours! Harry's half−crazy!’<br> Things came rushing back into place−− the singing, the torches, the great shout of the marching clubs. She<br> squirmed in Patton's arms and gave a long low cry.<br> ‘Oh, I want to get out of here! I'm going back home. Take me home’−− her voice rose to a scream that sent a chill<br> to Harry's heart as he came racing down the next passage−− ‘to−morrow!’ she cried with delirious, unrestrained<br> passion−− ‘To−morrow! To−morrow! To−morrow!’<br> VI<br> The wealth of golden sunlight poured a quite enervating yet oddly comforting heat over the house where day long<br> it faced the dusty stretch of road. Two birds were making a great to−do in a cool spot found among the branches<br> of a tree next door, and down the street a colored woman was announcing herself melodiously as a purveyor of<br> strawberries. It was April afternoon.<br> Sally Carrol Happer, resting her chin on her arm, and her arm on an old window−seat, gazed sleepily down over<br> the spangled dust whence the heat waves were rising for the first time this spring. She was watching a very<br> ancient Ford turn a perilous corner and rattle and groan to a jolting stop at the end of the walls. She made no<br> sound, and in a minute a strident familiar whistle rent the air. Sally Carrol smiled and blinked.<br> ‘Good mawnin'.’<br> A head appeared tortuously from under the cartop below.<br> ‘'Tain't mawnin'.’<br> ‘Sure enough!’ she said in affected surprise. ‘I guess maybe not.’<br> ‘What you doin'?’<br> ‘Eatin' green peach. 'Spect to die any minute.’<br> Clark twisted himself a last impossible notch to get a view of her face.<br> ‘Water's warm as a kettla steam, Sally Carrol. Wanta go swimmin'?’<br> ‘Hate to move,’ sighed Sally Carrol lazily, ‘but I reckon so.’</p><br>I<br><br>Some of the caddies were poor as sin and lived in one-room houses with a neurasthenic cow in the front yard, but Dexter Green’s father owned the second best grocery-store in Black Bear — the best one was ‘The Hub,’ patronized by the wealthy people from Sherry Island — and Dexter caddied only for pocket-money.<br><br>In the fall when the days became crisp and gray, and the long Minnesota winter shut down like the white lid of a box, Dexter’s skis moved over the snow that hid the fairways of the golf course. At these times the country gave him a feeling of profound melancholy — it offended him that the links should lie in enforced fallowness, haunted by ragged sparrows for the long season. It was dreary, too, that on the tees where the gay colors fluttered in summer there were now only the desolate sand-boxes knee-deep in crusted ice. When he crossed the hills the wind blew cold as misery, and if the sun was out he tramped with his eyes squinted up against the hard dimensionless glare.<br><br>In April the winter ceased abruptly. The snow ran down into Black Bear Lake scarcely tarrying for the early golfers to brave the season with red and black balls. Without elation, without an interval of moist glory, the cold was gone.<br><br>Dexter knew that there was something dismal about this Northern spring, just as he knew there was something gorgeous about the fall. Fall made him clinch his hands and tremble and repeat idiotic sentences to himself, and make brisk abrupt gestures of command to imaginary audiences and armies. October filled him with hope which November raised to a sort of ecstatic triumph, and in this mood the fleeting brilliant impressions of the summer at Sherry Island were ready grist to his mill. He became a golf champion and defeated Mr. T. A. Hedrick in a marvellous match played a hundred times over the fairways of his imagination, a match each detail of which he changed about untiringly — sometimes he won with almost laughable ease, sometimes he came up magnificently from behind. Again, stepping from a Pierce-Arrow automobile, like Mr. Mortimer Jones, he strolled frigidly into the lounge of the Sherry Island Golf Club — or perhaps, surrounded by an admiring crowd, he gave an exhibition of fancy diving from the spring-board of the club raft. . . . Among those who watched him in open-mouthed wonder was Mr. Mortimer Jones.<br><br>And one day it came to pass that Mr. Jones — himself and not his ghost — came up to Dexter with tears in his eyes and said that Dexter was the —— best caddy in the club, and wouldn’t he decide not to quit if Mr. Jones made it worth his while, because every other —— caddy in the club lost one ball a hole for him — regularly —<br><br>‘No, sir,’ said Dexter decisively, ‘I don’t want to caddy any more.’ Then, after a pause: ‘I’m too old.’<br><br>‘You’re not more than fourteen. Why the devil did you decide just this morning that you wanted to quit? You promised that next week you’d go over to the State tournament with me.’<br><br>‘I decided I was too old.’<br><br>Dexter handed in his ‘A Class’ badge, collected what money was due him from the caddy master, and walked home to Black Bear Village.<br><br>‘The best —— caddy I ever saw,’ shouted Mr. Mortimer Jones over a drink that afternoon. ‘Never lost a ball! Willing! Intelligent! Quiet! Honest! Grateful!’<br><br>The little girl who had done this was eleven — beautifully ugly as little girls are apt to be who are destined after a few years to be inexpressibly lovely and bring no end of misery to a great number of men. The spark, however, was perceptible. There was a general ungodliness in the way her lips twisted down at the corners when she smiled, and in the — Heaven help us! — in the almost passionate quality of her eyes. Vitality is born early in such women. It was utterly in evidence now, shining through her thin frame in a sort of glow.<br><br>She had come eagerly out on to the course at nine o’clock with a white linen nurse and five small new golf-clubs in a white canvas bag which the nurse was carrying. When Dexter first saw her she was standing by the caddy house, rather ill at ease and trying to conceal the fact by engaging her nurse in an obviously unnatural conversation graced by startling and irrelevant grimaces from herself.<br><br>‘Well, it’s certainly a nice day, Hilda,’ Dexter heard her say. She drew down the corners of her mouth, smiled, and glanced furtively around, her eyes in transit falling for an instant on Dexter.<br><br>Then to the nurse:<br><br>‘Well, I guess there aren’t very many people out here this morning, are there?’<br><br>The smile again — radiant, blatantly artificial — convincing.<br><br>‘I don’t know what we’re supposed to do now,’ said the nurse, looking nowhere in particular.<br><br>‘Oh, that’s all right. I’ll fix it up.’<br><br>Dexter stood perfectly still, his mouth slightly ajar. He knew that if he moved forward a step his stare would be in her line of vision — if he moved backward he would lose his full view of her face. For a moment he had not realized how young she was. Now he remembered having seen her several times the year before — in bloomers.<br><br>Suddenly, involuntarily, he laughed, a short abrupt laugh — then, startled by himself, he turned and began to walk quickly away.<br><br>‘Boy!’<br><br>Dexter stopped.<br><br>‘Boy — ‘<br><br>Beyond question he was addressed. Not only that, but he was treated to that absurd smile, that preposterous smile — the memory of which at least a dozen men were to carry into middle age.<br><br>‘Boy, do you know where the golf teacher is?’<br><br>‘He’s giving a lesson.’<br><br>‘Well, do you know where the caddy-master is?’<br><br>‘He isn’t here yet this morning.’<br><br>‘Oh.’ For a moment this baffled her. She stood alternately on her right and left foot.<br><br>‘We’d like to get a caddy,’ said the nurse. ‘Mrs. Mortimer Jones sent us out to play golf, and we don’t know how without we get a caddy.’<br><br>Here she was stopped by an ominous glance from Miss Jones, followed immediately by the smile.<br><br>‘There aren’t any caddies here except me,’ said Dexter to the nurse, ‘and I got to stay here in charge until the caddy-master gets here.’<br><br>‘Oh.’<br><br>Miss Jones and her retinue now withdrew, and at a proper distance from Dexter became involved in a heated conversation, which was concluded by Miss Jones taking one of the clubs and hitting it on the ground with violence. For further emphasis she raised it again and was about to bring it down smartly upon the nurse’s bosom, when the nurse seized the club and twisted it from her hands.<br><br>‘You damn little mean old thing!’ cried Miss Jones wildly.<br><br>Another argument ensued. Realizing that the elements of the comedy were implied in the scene, Dexter several times began to laugh, but each time restrained the laugh before it reached audibility. He could not resist the monstrous conviction that the little girl was justified in beating the nurse.<br><br>The situation was resolved by the fortuitous appearance of the caddy-master, who was appealed to immediately by the nurse.<br><br>‘Miss Jones is to have a little caddy, and this one says he can’t go.’<br><br>‘Mr. McKenna said I was to wait here till you came,’ said Dexter quickly.<br><br>‘Well, he’s here now.’ Miss Jones smiled cheerfully at the caddy-master. Then she dropped her bag and set off at a haughty mince toward the first tee.<br><br>‘Well?’ The caddy-master turned to Dexter. ‘What you standing there like a dummy for? Go pick up the young lady’s clubs.’<br><br>‘I don’t think I’ll go out to-day,’ said Dexter.<br><br>‘You don’t — ‘<br><br>‘I think I’ll quit.’<br><br>The enormity of his decision frightened him. He was a favorite caddy, and the thirty dollars a month he earned through the summer were not to be made elsewhere around the lake. But he had received a strong emotional shock, and his perturbation required a violent and immediate outlet.<br><br>It is not so simple as that, either. As so frequently would be the case in the future, Dexter was unconsciously dictated to by his winter dreams.<br><br>II<br><br>Now, of course, the quality and the seasonability of these winter dreams varied, but the stuff of them remained. They persuaded Dexter several years later to pass up a business course at the State university — his father, prospering now, would have paid his way — for the precarious advantage of attending an older and more famous university in the East, where he was bothered by his scanty funds. But do not get the impression, because his winter dreams happened to be concerned at first with musings on the rich, that there was anything merely snobbish in the boy. He wanted not association with glittering things and glittering people — he wanted the glittering things themselves. Often he reached out for the best without knowing why he wanted it — and sometimes he ran up against the mysterious denials and prohibitions in which life indulges. It is with one of those denials and not with his career as a whole that this story deals.<br><br>He made money. It was rather amazing. After college he went to the city from which Black Bear Lake draws its wealthy patrons. When he was only twenty-three and had been there not quite two years, there were already people who liked to say: ‘Now there’s a boy — ‘ All about him rich men’s sons were peddling bonds precariously, or investing patrimonies precariously, or plodding through the two dozen volumes of the ‘George Washington Commercial Course,’ but Dexter borrowed a thousand dollars on his college degree and his confident mouth, and bought a partnership in a laundry.<br><br>It was a small laundry when he went into it but Dexter made a specialty of learning how the English washed fine woollen golf-stockings without shrinking them, and within a year he was catering to the trade that wore knickerbockers. Men were insisting that their Shetland hose and sweaters go to his laundry just as they had insisted on a caddy who could find golf-balls. A little later he was doing their wives’ lingerie as well — and running five branches in different parts of the city. Before he was twenty-seven he owned the largest string of laundries in his section of the country. It was then that he sold out and went to New York. But the part of his story that concerns us goes back to the days when he was making his first big success.<br><br>When he was twenty-three Mr. Hart — one of the gray-haired men who like to say ‘Now there’s a boy’ — gave him a guest card to the Sherry Island Golf Club for a week-end. So he signed his name one day on the register, and that afternoon played golf in a foursome with Mr. Hart and Mr. Sandwood and Mr. T. A. Hedrick. He did not consider it necessary to remark that he had once carried Mr. Hart’s bag over this same links, and that he knew every trap and gully with his eyes shut — but he found himself glancing at the four caddies who trailed them, trying to catch a gleam or gesture that would remind him of himself, that would lessen the gap which lay between his present and his past.<br><br>It was a curious day, slashed abruptly with fleeting, familiar impressions. One minute he had the sense of being a trespasser — in the next he was impressed by the tremendous superiority he felt toward Mr. T. A. Hedrick, who was a bore and not even a good golfer any more.<br><br>Then, because of a ball Mr. Hart lost near the fifteenth green, an enormous thing happened. While they were searching the stiff grasses of the rough there was a clear call of ‘Fore!’ from behind a hill in their rear. And as they all turned abruptly from their search a bright new ball sliced abruptly over the hill and caught Mr. T. A. Hedrick in the abdomen.<br><br>‘By Gad!’ cried Mr. T. A. Hedrick, ‘they ought to put some of these crazy women off the course. It’s getting to be outrageous.’<br><br>A head and a voice came up together over the hill:<br><br>‘Do you mind if we go through?’<br><br>‘You hit me in the stomach!’ declared Mr. Hedrick wildly.<br><br>‘Did I?’ The girl approached the group of men. ‘I’m sorry. I yelled ‘Fore!’’<br><br>Her glance fell casually on each of the men — then scanned the fairway for her ball.<br><br>‘Did I bounce into the rough?’<br><br>It was impossible to determine whether this question was ingenuous or malicious. In a moment, however, she left no doubt, for as her partner came up over the hill she called cheerfully:<br><br>‘Here I am! I’d have gone on the green except that I hit something.’<br><br>As she took her stance for a short mashie shot, Dexter looked at her closely. She wore a blue gingham dress, rimmed at throat and shoulders with a white edging that accentuated her tan. The quality of exaggeration, of thinness, which had made her passionate eyes and down-turning mouth absurd at eleven, was gone now. She was arrestingly beautiful. The color in her cheeks was centered like the color in a picture — it was not a ‘high’ color, but a son of fluctuating and feverish warmth, so shaded that it seemed at any moment it would recede and disappear. This color and the mobility of her mouth gave a continual impression of flux, of intense life, of passionate vitality — balanced only partially by the sad luxury of her eyes.<br><br>She swung her mashie impatiently and without interest, pitching the ball into a sand-pit on the other side of the green. With a quick, insincere smile and a careless ‘Thank you!’ she went on after it.<br><br>‘That Judy Jones!’ remarked Mr. Hedrick on the next tee, as they waited — some moments — for her to play on ahead. ‘All she needs is to be turned up and spanked for six months and then to be married off to an old-fashioned cavalry captain.’<br><br>‘My God, she’s good-looking!’ said Mr. Sandwood, who was just over thirty.<br><br>‘Good-looking!’ cried Mr. Hedrick contemptuously, ‘she always looks as if she wanted to be kissed! Turning those big cow-eyes on every calf in town!’<br><br>It was doubtful if Mr. Hedrick intended a reference to the maternal instinct.<br><br>‘She’d play pretty good golf if she’d try,’ said Mr. Sandwood.<br><br>‘She has no form,’ said Mr. Hedrick solemnly.<br><br>‘She has a nice figure,’ said Mr. Sandwood.<br><br>‘Better thank the Lord she doesn’t drive a swifter ball,’ said Mr. Hart, winking at Dexter.<br><br>Later in the afternoon the sun went down with a riotous swirl of gold and varying blues and scarlets, and left the dry, rustling night of Western summer. Dexter watched from the veranda of the Golf Club, watched the even overlap of the waters in the little wind, silver molasses under the harvest-moon. Then the moon held a finger to her lips and the lake became a clear pool, pale and quiet. Dexter put on his bathing-suit and swam out to the farthest raft, where he stretched dripping on the wet canvas of the springboard.<br><br>There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Over on a dark peninsula a piano was playing the songs of last summer and of summers before that — songs from ‘Chin-Chin’ and ‘The Count of Luxemburg’ and ‘The Chocolate Soldier’ — and because the sound of a piano over a stretch of water had always seemed beautiful to Dexter he lay perfectly quiet and listened.<br><br>The tune the piano was playing at that moment had been gay and new five years before when Dexter was a sophomore at college. They had played it at a prom once when he could not afford the luxury of proms, and he had stood outside the gymnasium and listened. The sound of the tune precipitated in him a sort of ecstasy and it was with that ecstasy he viewed what happened to him now. It was a mood of intense appreciation, a sense that, for once, he was magnificently attune to life and that everything about him was radiating a brightness and a glamour he might never know again.<br><br>A low, pale oblong detached itself suddenly from the darkness of the Island, spitting forth the reverberate sound of a racing motor-boat. Two white streamers of cleft water rolled themselves out behind it and almost immediately the boat was beside him, drowning out the hot tinkle of the piano in the drone of its spray. Dexter raising himself on his arms was aware of a figure standing at the wheel, of two dark eyes regarding him over the lengthening space of water — then the boat had gone by and was sweeping in an immense and purposeless circle of spray round and round in the middle of the lake. With equal eccentricity one of the circles flattened out and headed back toward the raft.<br><br>‘Who’s that?’ she called, shutting off her motor. She was so near now that Dexter could see her bathing-suit, which consisted apparently of pink rompers.<br><br>The nose of the boat bumped the raft, and as the latter tilted rakishly he was precipitated toward her. With different degrees of interest they recognized each other.<br><br>‘Aren’t you one of those men we played through this afternoon?’ she demanded.<br><br>He was.<br><br>‘Well, do you know how to drive a motor-boat? Because if you do I wish you’d drive this one so I can ride on the surf-board behind. My name is Judy Jones’ — she favored him with an absurd smirk — rather, what tried to be a smirk, for, twist her mouth as she might, it was not grotesque, it was merely beautiful — ‘and I live in a house over there on the Island, and in that house there is a man waiting for me. When he drove up at the door I drove out of the dock because he says I’m his ideal.’<br><br>There was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. Dexter sat beside Judy Jones and she explained how her boat was driven. Then she was in the water, swimming to the floating surfboard with a sinuous crawl. Watching her was without effort to the eye, watching a branch waving or a sea-gull flying. Her arms, burned to butternut, moved sinuously among the dull platinum ripples, elbow appearing first, casting the forearm back with a cadence of falling water, then reaching out and down, stabbing a path ahead.<br><br>They moved out into the lake; turning, Dexter saw that she was kneeling on the low rear of the now uptilted surf-board.<br><br>‘Go faster,’ she called, ‘fast as it’ll go.’<br><br>Obediently he jammed the lever forward and the white spray mounted at the bow. When he looked around again the girl was standing up on the rushing board, her arms spread wide, her eyes lifted toward the moon.<br><br>‘It’s awful cold,’ she shouted. ‘What’s your name?’<br><br>He told her.<br><br>‘Well, why don’t you come to dinner to-morrow night?’<br><br>His heart turned over like the fly-wheel of the boat, and, for the second time, her casual whim gave a new direction to his life.<br><br>III<br><br>Next evening while he waited for her to come down-stairs, Dexter peopled the soft deep summer room and the sun-porch that opened from it with the men who had already loved Judy Jones. He knew the sort of men they were — the men who when he first went to college had entered from the great prep schools with graceful clothes and the deep tan of healthy summers. He had seen that, in one sense, he was better than these men. He was newer and stronger. Yet in acknowledging to himself that he wished his children to be like them he was admitting that he was but the rough, strong stuff from which they eternally sprang.<br><br>When the time had come for him to wear good clothes, he had known who were the best tailors in America, and the best tailors in America had made him the suit he wore this evening. He had acquired that particular reserve peculiar to his university, that set it off from other universities. He recognized the value to him of such a mannerism and he had adopted it; he knew that to be careless in dress and manner required more confidence than to be careful. But carelessness was for his children. His mother’s name had been Krimslich. She was a Bohemian of the peasant class and she had talked broken English to the end of her days. Her son must keep to the set patterns.<br><br>At a little after seven Judy Jones came down-stairs. She wore a blue silk afternoon dress, and he was disappointed at first that she had not put on something more elaborate. This feeling was accentuated when, after a brief greeting, she went to the door of a butler’s pantry and pushing it open called: ‘You can serve dinner, Martha.’ He had rather expected that a butler would announce dinner, that there would be a cocktail. Then he put these thoughts behind him as they sat down side by side on a lounge and looked at each other.<br><br>‘Father and mother won’t be here,’ she said thoughtfully.<br><br>He remembered the last time he had seen her father, and he was glad the parents were not to be here to-night — they might wonder who he was. He had been born in Keeble, a Minnesota village fifty miles farther north, and he always gave Keeble as his home instead of Black Bear Village. Country towns were well enough to come from if they weren’t inconveniently in sight and used as footstools by fashionable lakes.<br><br>They talked of his university, which she had visited frequently during the past two years, and of the near-by city which supplied Sherry Island with its patrons, and whither Dexter would return next day to his prospering laundries.<br><br>During dinner she slipped into a moody depression which gave Dexter a feeling of uneasiness. Whatever petulance she uttered in her throaty voice worried him. Whatever she smiled at — at him, at a chicken liver, at nothing — it disturbed him that her smile could have no root in mirth, or even in amusement. When the scarlet corners of her lips curved down, it was less a smile than an invitation to a kiss.<br><br>Then, after dinner, she led him out on the dark sun-porch and deliberately changed the atmosphere.<br><br>‘Do you mind if I weep a little?’ she said.<br><br>‘I’m afraid I’m boring you,’ he responded quickly.<br><br>‘You’re not. I like you. But I’ve just had a terrible afternoon. There was a man I cared about, and this afternoon he told me out of a clear sky that he was poor as a church-mouse. He’d never even hinted it before. Does this sound horribly mundane?’<br><br>‘Perhaps he was afraid to tell you.’<br><br>‘Suppose he was,’ she answered. ‘He didn’t start right. You see, if I’d thought of him as poor — well, I’ve been mad about loads of poor men, and fully intended to marry them all. But in this case, I hadn’t thought of him that way, and my interest in him wasn’t strong enough to survive the shock. As if a girl calmly informed her fiancé that she was a widow. He might not object to widows, but —<br><br>‘Let’s start right,’ she interrupted herself suddenly. ‘Who are you, anyhow?’<br><br>For a moment Dexter hesitated. Then:<br><br>‘I’m nobody,’ he announced. ‘My career is largely a matter of futures.’<br><br>‘Are you poor?’<br><br>‘No,’ he said frankly, ‘I’m probably making more money than any man my age in the Northwest. I know that’s an obnoxious remark, but you advised me to start right.’<br><br>There was a pause. Then she smiled and the corners of her mouth drooped and an almost imperceptible sway brought her closer to him, looking up into his eyes. A lump rose in Dexter’s throat, and he waited breathless for the experiment, facing the unpredictable compound that would form mysteriously from the elements of their lips. Then he saw — she communicated her excitement to him, lavishly, deeply, with kisses that were not a promise but a fulfillment. They aroused in him not hunger demanding renewal but surfeit that would demand more surfeit . . . kisses that were like charity, creating want by holding back nothing at all.<br><br>It did not take him many hours to decide that he had wanted Judy Jones ever since he was a proud, desirous little boy.<br><br>IV<br><br>It began like that — and continued, with varying shades of intensity, on such a note right up to the dénouement. Dexter surrendered a part of himself to the most direct and unprincipled personality with which he had ever come in contact. Whatever Judy wanted, she went after with the full pressure of her charm. There was no divergence of method, no jockeying for position or premeditation of effects — there was a very little mental side to any of her affairs. She simply made men conscious to the highest degree of her physical loveliness. Dexter had no desire to change her. Her deficiencies were knit up with a passionate energy that transcended and justified them.<br><br>When, as Judy’s head lay against his shoulder that first night, she whispered, ‘I don’t know what’s the matter with me. Last night I thought I was in love with a man and to-night I think I’m in love with you — ‘ — it seemed to him a beautiful and romantic thing to say. It was the exquisite excitability that for the moment he controlled and owned. But a week later he was compelled to view this same quality in a different light. She took him in her roadster to a picnic supper, and after supper she disappeared, likewise in her roadster, with another man. Dexter became enormously upset and was scarcely able to be decently civil to the other people present. When she assured him that she had not kissed the other man, he knew she was lying — yet he was glad that she had taken the trouble to lie to him.<br><br>He was, as he found before the summer ended, one of a varying dozen who circulated about her. Each of them had at one time been favored above all others — about half of them still basked in the solace of occasional sentimental revivals. Whenever one showed signs of dropping out through long neglect, she granted him a brief honeyed hour, which encouraged him to tag along for a year or so longer. Judy made these forays upon the helpless and defeated without malice, indeed half unconscious that there was anything mischievous in what she did.<br><br>When a new man came to town every one dropped out — dates were automatically cancelled.<br><br>The helpless part of trying to do anything about it was that she did it all herself. She was not a girl who could be ‘won’ in the kinetic sense — she was proof against cleverness, she was proof against charm; if any of these assailed her too strongly she would immediately resolve the affair to a physical basis, and under the magic of her physical splendor the strong as well as the brilliant played her game and not their own. She was entertained only by the gratification of her desires and by the direct exercise of her own charm. Perhaps from so much youthful love, so many youthful lovers, she had come, in self-defense, to nourish herself wholly from within.<br><br>Succeeding Dexter’s first exhilaration came restlessness and dissatisfaction. The helpless ecstasy of losing himself in her was opiate rather than tonic. It was fortunate for his work during the winter that those moments of ecstasy came infrequently. Early in their acquaintance it had seemed for a while that there was a deep and spontaneous mutual attraction — that first August, for example — three days of long evenings on her dusky veranda, of strange wan kisses through the late afternoon, in shadowy alcoves or behind the protecting trellises of the garden arbors, of mornings when she was fresh as a dream and almost shy at meeting him in the clarity of the rising day. There was all the ecstasy of an engagement about it, sharpened by his realization that there was no engagement. It was during those three days that, for the first time, he had asked her to marry him. She said ‘maybe some day,’ she said ‘kiss me,’ she said ‘I’d like to marry you,’ she said ‘I love you’ — she said — nothing.<br><br>The three days were interrupted by the arrival of a New York man who visited at her house for half September. To Dexter’s agony, rumor engaged them. The man was the son of the president of a great trust company. But at the end of a month it was reported that Judy was yawning. At a dance one night she sat all evening in a motor-boat with a local beau, while the New Yorker searched the club for her frantically. She told the local beau that she was bored with her visitor, and two days later he left. She was seen with him at the station, and it was reported that he looked very mournful indeed.<br><br>On this note the summer ended. Dexter was twenty-four, and he found himself increasingly in a position to do as he wished. He joined two clubs in the city and lived at one of them. Though he was by no means an integral part of the stag-lines at these clubs, he managed to be on hand at dances where Judy Jones was likely to appear. He could have gone out socially as much as he liked — he was an eligible young man, now, and popular with down-town fathers. His confessed devotion to Judy Jones had rather solidified his position. But he had no social aspirations and rather despised the dancing men who were always on tap for the Thursday or Saturday parties and who filled in at dinners with the younger married set. Already he was playing with the idea of going East to New York. He wanted to take Judy Jones with him. No disillusion as to the world in which she had grown up could cure his illusion as to her desirability.<br><br>Remember that — for only in the light of it can what he did for her be understood.<br><br>Eighteen months after he first met Judy Jones he became engaged to another girl. Her name was Irene Scheerer, and her father was one of the men who had always believed in Dexter. Irene was light-haired and sweet and honorable, and a little stout, and she had two suitors whom she pleasantly relinquished when Dexter formally asked her to marry him.<br><br>Summer, fall, winter, spring, another summer, another fall — so much he had given of his active life to the incorrigible lips of Judy Jones. She had treated him with interest, with encouragement, with malice, with indifference, with contempt. She had inflicted on him the innumerable little slights and indignities possible in such a case — as if in revenge for having ever cared for him at all. She had beckoned him and yawned at him and beckoned him again and he had responded often with bitterness and narrowed eyes. She had brought him ecstatic happiness and intolerable agony of spirit. She had caused him untold inconvenience and not a little trouble. She had insulted him, and she had ridden over him, and she had played his interest in her against his interest in his work — for fun. She had done everything to him except to criticise him — this she had not done — it seemed to him only because it might have sullied the utter indifference she manifested and sincerely felt toward him.<br><br>When autumn had come and gone again it occurred to him that he could not have Judy Jones. He had to beat this into his mind but he convinced himself at last. He lay awake at night for a while and argued it over. He told himself the trouble and the pain she had caused him, he enumerated her glaring deficiencies as a wife. Then he said to himself that he loved her, and after a while he fell asleep. For a week, lest he imagined her husky voice over the telephone or her eyes opposite him at lunch, he worked hard and late, and at night he went to his office and plotted out his years.<br><br>At the end of a week he went to a dance and cut in on her once. For almost the first time since they had met he did not ask her to sit out with him or tell her that she was lovely. It hurt him that she did not miss these things — that was all. He was not jealous when he saw that there was a new man to-night. He had been hardened against jealousy long before.<br><br>He stayed late at the dance. He sat for an hour with Irene Scheerer and talked about books and about music. He knew very little about either. But he was beginning to be master of his own time now, and he had a rather priggish notion that he — the young and already fabulously successful Dexter Green — should know more about such things.<br><br>That was in October, when he was twenty-five. In January, Dexter and Irene became engaged. It was to be announced in June, and they were to be married three months later.<br><br>The Minnesota winter prolonged itself interminably, and it was almost May when the winds came soft and the snow ran down into Black Bear Lake at last. For the first time in over a year Dexter was enjoying a certain tranquility of spirit. Judy Jones had been in Florida, and afterward in Hot Springs, and somewhere she had been engaged, and somewhere she had broken it off. At first, when Dexter had definitely given her up, it had made him sad that people still linked them together and asked for news of her, but when he began to be placed at dinner next to Irene Scheerer people didn’t ask him about her any more — they told him about her. He ceased to be an authority on her.<br><br>May at last. Dexter walked the streets at night when the darkness was damp as rain, wondering that so soon, with so little done, so much of ecstasy had gone from him. May one year back had been marked by Judy’s poignant, unforgivable, yet forgiven turbulence — it had been one of those rare times when he fancied she had grown to care for him. That old penny’s worth of happiness he had spent for this bushel of content. He knew that Irene would be no more than a curtain spread behind him, a hand moving among gleaming tea-cups, a voice calling to children . . . fire and loveliness were gone, the magic of nights and the wonder of the varying hours and seasons . . . slender lips, down-turning, dropping to his lips and bearing him up into a heaven of eyes. . . . The thing was deep in him. He was too strong and alive for it to die lightly.<br><br>In the middle of May when the weather balanced for a few days on the thin bridge that led to deep summer he turned in one night at Irene’s house. Their engagement was to be announced in a week now — no one would be surprised at it. And to-night they would sit together on the lounge at the University Club and look on for an hour at the dancers. It gave him a sense of solidity to go with her — she was so sturdily popular, so intensely ‘great.’<br><br>He mounted the steps of the brownstone house and stepped inside.<br><br>‘Irene,’ he called.<br><br>Mrs. Scheerer came out of the living-room to meet him.<br><br>‘Dexter,’ she said, ‘Irene’s gone up-stairs with a splitting headache. She wanted to go with you but I made her go to bed.’<br><br>‘Nothing serious, I— ‘<br><br>‘Oh, no. She’s going to play golf with you in the morning. You can spare her for just one night, can’t you, Dexter?’<br><br>Her smile was kind. She and Dexter liked each other. In the living-room he talked for a moment before he said good-night.<br><br>Returning to the University Club, where he had rooms, he stood in the doorway for a moment and watched the dancers. He leaned against the door-post, nodded at a man or two — yawned.<br><br>‘Hello, darling.’<br><br>The familiar voice at his elbow startled him. Judy Jones had left a man and crossed the room to him — Judy Jones, a slender enamelled doll in cloth of gold: gold in a band at her head, gold in two slipper points at her dress’s hem. The fragile glow of her face seemed to blossom as she smiled at him. A breeze of warmth and light blew through the room. His hands in the pockets of his dinner-jacket tightened spasmodically. He was filled with a sudden excitement.<br><br>‘When did you get back?’ he asked casually.<br><br>‘Come here and I’ll tell you about it.’<br><br>She turned and he followed her. She had been away — he could have wept at the wonder of her return. She had passed through enchanted streets, doing things that were like provocative music. All mysterious happenings, all fresh and quickening hopes, had gone away with her, come back with her now.<br><br>She turned in the doorway.<br><br>‘Have you a car here? If you haven’t, I have.’<br><br>‘I have a coupé.’<br><br>In then, with a rustle of golden cloth. He slammed the door. Into so many cars she had stepped — like this — like that — her back against the leather, so — her elbow resting on the door — waiting. She would have been soiled long since had there been anything to soil her — except herself — but this was her own self outpouring.<br><br>With an effort he forced himself to start the car and back into the street. This was nothing, he must remember. She had done this before, and he had put her behind him, as he would have crossed a bad account from his books.<br><br>He drove slowly down-town and, affecting abstraction, traversed the deserted streets of the business section, peopled here and there where a movie was giving out its crowd or where consumptive or pugilistic youth lounged in front of pool halls. The clink of glasses and the slap of hands on the bars issued from saloons, cloisters of glazed glass and dirty yellow light.<br><br>She was watching him closely and the silence was embarrassing, yet in this crisis he could find no casual word with which to profane the hour. At a convenient turning he began to zigzag back toward the University Club.<br><br>‘Have you missed me?’ she asked suddenly.<br><br>‘Everybody missed you.’<br><br>He wondered if she knew of Irene Scheerer. She had been back only a day — her absence had been almost contemporaneous with his engagement.<br><br>‘What a remark!’ Judy laughed sadly — without sadness. She looked at him searchingly. He became absorbed in the dashboard.<br><br>‘You’re handsomer than you used to be,’ she said thoughtfully. ‘Dexter, you have the most rememberable eyes.’<br><br>He could have laughed at this, but he did not laugh. It was the sort of thing that was said to sophomores. Yet it stabbed at him.<br><br>‘I’m awfully tired of everything, darling.’ She called every one darling, endowing the endearment with careless, individual comraderie. ‘I wish you’d marry me.’<br><br>The directness of this confused him. He should have told her now that he was going to marry another girl, but he could not tell her. He could as easily have sworn that he had never loved her.<br><br>‘I think we’d get along,’ she continued, on the same note, ‘unless probably you’ve forgotten me and fallen in love with another girl.’<br><br>Her confidence was obviously enormous. She had said, in effect, that she found such a thing impossible to believe, that if it were true he had merely committed a childish indiscretion — and probably to show off. She would forgive him, because it was not a matter of any moment but rather something to be brushed aside lightly.<br><br>‘Of course you could never love anybody but me,’ she continued. ‘I like the way you love me. Oh, Dexter, have you forgotten last year?’<br><br>‘No, I haven’t forgotten.’<br><br>‘Neither have I!’<br><br>Was she sincerely moved — or was she carried along by the wave of her own acting?<br><br>‘I wish we could be like that again,’ she said, and he forced himself to answer:<br><br>‘I don’t think we can.’<br><br>‘I suppose not. . . . I hear you’re giving Irene Scheerer a violent rush.’<br><br>There was not the faintest emphasis on the name, yet Dexter was suddenly ashamed.<br><br>‘Oh, take me home,’ cried Judy suddenly; ‘I don’t want to go back to that idiotic dance — with those children.’<br><br>Then, as he turned up the street that led to the residence district, Judy began to cry quietly to herself. He had never seen her cry before.<br><br>The dark street lightened, the dwellings of the rich loomed up around them, he stopped his coupé in front of the great white bulk of the Mortimer Joneses house, somnolent, gorgeous, drenched with the splendor of the damp moonlight. Its solidity startled him. The strong walls, the steel of the girders, the breadth and beam and pomp of it were there only to bring out the contrast with the young beauty beside him. It was sturdy to accentuate her slightness — as if to show what a breeze could be generated by a butterfly’s wing.<br><br>He sat perfectly quiet, his nerves in wild clamor, afraid that if he moved he would find her irresistibly in his arms. Two tears had rolled down her wet face and trembled on her upper lip.<br><br>‘I’m more beautiful than anybody else,’ she said brokenly, ‘why can’t I be happy?’ Her moist eyes tore at his stability — her mouth turned slowly downward with an exquisite sadness: ‘I’d like to marry you if you’ll have me, Dexter. I suppose you think I’m not worth having, but I’ll be so beautiful for you, Dexter.’<br><br>A million phrases of anger, pride, passion, hatred, tenderness fought on his lips. Then a perfect wave of emotion washed over him, carrying off with it a sediment of wisdom, of convention, of doubt, of honor. This was his girl who was speaking, his own, his beautiful, his pride.<br><br>‘Won’t you come in?’ He heard her draw in her breath sharply.<br><br>Waiting.<br><br>‘All right,’ his voice was trembling, ‘I’ll come in.’<br><br>V<br><br>It was strange that neither when it was over nor a long time afterward did he regret that night. Looking at it from the perspective of ten years, the fact that Judy’s flare for him endured just one month seemed of little importance. Nor did it matter that by his yielding he subjected himself to a deeper agony in the end and gave serious hurt to Irene Scheerer and to Irene’s parents, who had befriended him. There was nothing sufficiently pictorial about Irene’s grief to stamp itself on his mind.<br><br>Dexter was at bottom hard-minded. The attitude of the city on his action was of no importance to him, not because he was going to leave the city, but because any outside attitude on the situation seemed superficial. He was completely indifferent to popular opinion. Nor, when he had seen that it was no use, that he did not possess in himself the power to move fundamentally or to hold Judy Jones, did he bear any malice toward her. He loved her, and he would love her until the day he was too old for loving — but he could not have her. So he tasted the deep pain that is reserved only for the strong, just as he had tasted for a little while the deep happiness.<br><br>Even the ultimate falsity of the grounds upon which Judy terminated the engagement that she did not want to ‘take him away’ from Irene — Judy, who had wanted nothing else — did not revolt him. He was beyond any revulsion or any amusement.<br><br>He went East in February with the intention of selling out his laundries and settling in New York — but the war came to America in March and changed his plans. He returned to the West, handed over the management of the business to his partner, and went into the first officers’ training-camp in late April. He was one of those young thousands who greeted the war with a certain amount of relief, welcoming the liberation from webs of tangled emotion.<br><br>VI<br><br>This story is not his biography, remember, although things creep into it which have nothing to do with those dreams he had when he was young. We are almost done with them and with him now. There is only one more incident to be related here, and it happens seven years farther on.<br><br>It took place in New York, where he had done well — so well that there were no barriers too high for him. He was thirty-two years old, and, except for one flying trip immediately after the war, he had not been West in seven years. A man named Devlin from Detroit came into his office to see him in a business way, and then and there this incident occurred, and closed out, so to speak, this particular side of his life.<br><br>‘So you’re from the Middle West,’ said the man Devlin with careless curiosity. ‘That’s funny — I thought men like you were probably born and raised on Wall Street. You know — wife of one of my best friends in Detroit came from your city. I was an usher at the wedding.’<br><br>Dexter waited with no apprehension of what was coming.<br><br>‘Judy Simms,’ said Devlin with no particular interest; ‘Judy Jones she was once.’<br><br>‘Yes, I knew her.’ A dull impatience spread over him. He had heard, of course, that she was married — perhaps deliberately he had heard no more.<br><br>‘Awfully nice girl,’ brooded Devlin meaninglessly, ‘I’m sort of sorry for her.’<br><br>‘Why?’ Something in Dexter was alert, receptive, at once.<br><br>‘Oh, Lud Simms has gone to pieces in a way. I don’t mean he ill-uses her, but he drinks and runs around — ‘<br><br>‘Doesn’t she run around?’<br><br>‘No. Stays at home with her kids.’<br><br>‘Oh.’<br><br>‘She’s a little too old for him,’ said Devlin.<br><br>‘Too old!’ cried Dexter. ‘Why, man, she’s only twenty-seven.’<br><br>He was possessed with a wild notion of rushing out into the streets and taking a train to Detroit. He rose to his feet spasmodically.<br><br>‘I guess you’re busy,’ Devlin apologized quickly. ‘I didn’t realize — ‘<br><br>‘No, I’m not busy,’ said Dexter, steadying his voice. ‘I’m not busy at all. Not busy at all. Did you say she was — twenty-seven? No, I said she was twenty-seven.’<br><br>‘Yes, you did,’ agreed Devlin dryly.<br>‘Go on, then. Go on.’<br><br>‘What do you mean?’<br><br>‘About Judy Jones.’<br><br>Devlin looked at him helplessly.<br><br>‘Well, that’s — I told you all there is to it. He treats her like the devil. Oh, they’re not going to get divorced or anything. When he’s particularly outrageous she forgives him. In fact, I’m inclined to think she loves him. She was a pretty girl when she first came to Detroit.’<br><br>A pretty girl! The phrase struck Dexter as ludicrous.<br><br>‘Isn’t she — a pretty girl, any more?’<br><br>‘Oh, she’s all right.’<br><br>‘Look here,’ said Dexter, sitting down suddenly, ‘I don’t understand. You say she was a ‘pretty girl’ and now you say she’s ‘all right.’ I don’t understand what you mean — Judy Jones wasn’t a pretty girl, at all. She was a great beauty. Why, I knew her, I knew her. She was — ‘<br><br>Devlin laughed pleasantly.<br><br>‘I’m not trying to start a row,’ he said. ‘I think Judy’s a nice girl and I like her. I can’t understand how a man like Lud Simms could fall madly in love with her, but he did.’ Then he added: ‘Most of the women like her.’<br><br>Dexter looked closely at Devlin, thinking wildly that there must be a reason for this, some insensitivity in the man or some private malice.<br><br>‘Lots of women fade just like that,’ Devlin snapped his fingers. ‘You must have seen it happen. Perhaps I’ve forgotten how pretty she was at her wedding. I’ve seen her so much since then, you see. She has nice eyes.’<br><br>A sort of dulness settled down upon Dexter. For the first time in his life he felt like getting very drunk. He knew that he was laughing loudly at something Devlin had said, but he did not know what it was or why it was funny. When, in a few minutes, Devlin went he lay down on his lounge and looked out the window at the New York sky-line into which the sun was sinking in dull lovely shades of pink and gold.<br><br>He had thought that having nothing else to lose he was invulnerable at last — but he knew that he had just lost something more, as surely as if he had married Judy Jones and seen her fade away before his eyes.<br><br>The dream was gone. Something had been taken from him. In a sort of panic he pushed the palms of his hands into his eyes and tried to bring up a picture of the waters lapping on Sherry Island and the moonlit veranda, and gingham on the golf-links and the dry sun and the gold color of her neck’s soft down. And her mouth damp to his kisses and her eyes plaintive with melancholy and her freshness like new fine linen in the morning. Why, these things were no longer in the world! They had existed and they existed no longer.<br><br>For the first time in years the tears were streaming down his face. But they were for himself now. He did not care about mouth and eyes and moving hands. He wanted to care, and he could not care. For he had gone away and he could never go back any more. The gates were closed, the sun was gone down, and there was no beauty but the gray beauty of steel that withstands all time. Even the grief he could have borne was left behind in the country of illusion, of youth, of the richness of life, where his winter dreams had flourished.<br><br>‘Long ago,’ he said, ‘long ago, there was something in me, but now that thing is gone. Now that thing is gone, that thing is gone. I cannot cry. I cannot care. That thing will come back no more.’</p>"}
