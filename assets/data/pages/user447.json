				"main_text": "I heard a thousand blended notes,<br> While in a grove I sate reclined,<br> In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br> Bring sad thoughts to the mind.<br><br> To her fair works did Nature link<br> The human soul that through me ran;<br> And much it grieved my heart to think<br> What man has made of man.<br><br> Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,<br> The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;<br> And 'tis my faith that every flower<br> Enjoys the air it breathes.<br><br> The birds around me hopped and played,<br> Their thoughts I cannot measure:--<br> But the least motion which they made<br> It seemed a thrill of pleasure.<br><br> The budding twigs spread out their fan,<br> To catch the breezy air;<br> And I must think, do all I can,<br> That there was pleasure there.<br><br> If this belief from heaven be sent,<br> If such be Nature's holy plan,<br> Have I not reason to lament<br> What man has made of man?"
