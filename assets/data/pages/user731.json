It's nearly five'<br><br> Oh! Chintzy, chintzy cheeriness,<br><br> Half dead and half alive.<br><br><br><br> Do you know that the stucco is peeling?<br><br> Do you know that the heart will stop?<br><br> From those yellow Italianate arches<br><br> Do you hear the plaster drop?<br><br><br><br> Nurse looked at the silent bedstead,<br><br> At the gray, decaying face,<br><br> As the calm of a Leamington ev'ning<br><br> Drifted into the place.<br><br><br><br> She moved the table of bottles<br><br> Away from the bed to the wall<br><br> And tiptoeing gently over the stairs<br><br> Turned down the gas in the hall.",
