I know it! and I know<br> How the May fields all golden show,<br> And when the day is young and sweet,<br> Gild gloriously the bare feet<br> That run to bathe<br> Du Lieber Gott!<br><br> Here am I, sweating, sick, and hot,<br> And there the shadowed waters fresh<br> Lean up to embrace the naked flesh.<br> Temperamentvoll German Jews<br> Drink beer around; - and here the dews<br> Are soft beneath a morn of gold.<br> Here tulips bloom as they are told;<br> Unkempt about those hedges blows<br> An English unofficial rose;<br> And there the unregulated sun<br> Slopes down to rest when day is done,<br> And wakes a vague unpunctual star,<br> A slippered Hesper; and there are<br> Meads towards Haslingfield and Coton<br> Where das Betreten's not verboten."
