				"main_text": "The Owl and the Pussy Cat went to sea<br> In a beautiful pea-green boat,<br> They took some honey, and plenty of money<br> Wrapped up in a five-pound note.<br> The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br> And sang to a small guitar,<br> 'O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,<br> What a beautiful Pussy you are,<br> You are,<br> You are!<br> What a beautiful Pussy you are!'<br><br> Pussy said to the Owl, 'You elegant fowl!<br> How charmingly sweet you sing!<br> O let us be married! too long we have tarried:<br> But what shall we do for a ring?'<br> They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br> To the land where the Bong-tree grows<br> And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood<br> With a ring at the end of his nose,<br> His nose,<br> His nose,<br> With a ring at the end of his nose. <br><br> 'Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br> Your ring?' Said the Piggy, 'I will.'<br> So they took it away, and were married next day<br> By the Turkey who lives on the hill.<br> They dined on mince, and slices of quince,<br> Which they ate with a runcible spoon<br> And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,<br> They danced by the light of the moon,<br> The moon,<br> The moon,<br> They danced by the light of the moon."
