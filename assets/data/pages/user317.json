				"main_text": "Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br><br>Write, for example, 'The night is starry<br>and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'<br><br>The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br><br>Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.<br>I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br><br>She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.<br>How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.<br><br>To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.<br>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br><br>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br>The night is starry and she is not with me.<br><br>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br>My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br>My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br><br>The same night whitening the same trees.<br>We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.<br>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.<br><br>Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.<br>Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br>Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br><br>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br>my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br>and these the last verses that I write for her."
