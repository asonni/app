Near them on the sand,<br><br> Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown<br><br> And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br><br> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br><br> Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,<br><br> The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.<br><br> And on the pedestal these words appear:<br><br> 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br><br> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'<br><br> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br><br> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br><br> The lone and level sands stretch far away.",
