				"main_text": "I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day.<br> What hours, O what black hours we have spent<br> This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you went!<br> And more must, in yet longer light's delay.<br><br> With witness I speak this. But where I say<br> Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament<br> Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent<br> To dearest him that lives alas! away.<br><br> I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decrees<br> Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;<br> Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse.<br><br> Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see<br> The lost are like this, and their scourge to be<br> As I am mine, their sweating selves, but worse."
