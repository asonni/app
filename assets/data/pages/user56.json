You listen with delight, <br> By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled. <br> You crown our distant ardours while we fight, <br> And mourn our laurelled memories when we're killed. <br> You can't believe that British troops 'retire' <br> When hell's last horror breaks them, and they run, <br> Trampling the terrible corpses--blind with blood. <br> O German mother dreaming by the fire, <br> While you are knitting socks to send your son <br> His face is trodden deeper in the mud.</p><br>Does it matter?-losing your legs?<br> For people will always be kind,<br> And you need not show that you mind<br> When others come in after hunting<br> To gobble their muffins and eggs.<br> Does it matter?-losing you sight?<br> There’s such splendid work for the blind;<br> And people will always be kind,<br> As you sit on the terrace remembering<br> And turning your face to the light.<br> Do they matter-those dreams in the pit?<br> You can drink and forget and be gald,<br> And people won't say that you’re mad;<br> For they know that you've fought for your country,<br> And no one will worry a bit.</p><br>Why do you lie with your legs ungainly huddled,<br> And one arm bent across your sullen, cold,<br> Exhausted face? It hurts my heart to watch you,<br> Deep-shadowed from the candle's guttering gold;<br> And you wonder why I shake you by the shoulder;<br> Drowsy, you mumble and sigh and turn your head . . . .<br> You are too young to fall asleep for ever;<br> And when you sleep you remind me of the dead.</p><br>Your dextrous wit will haunt us long <br> Wounding our grief with yesterday. <br> Your laughter is a broken song; <br> And death has found you, kind and gay. <br> <br> We may forget those transient things<br> That made your charm and our delight: <br> But loyal love has deathless wings <br> That rise and triumph out of night. <br> <br> So, in the days to come, your name <br> Shall be as music that ascends <br> When honour turns a heart from shame... <br> O heart of hearts! ... O friend of friends!</p><br>'Jack fell as he'd have wished,' the Mother said,<br> And folded up the letter that she'd read. <br> 'The Colonel writes so nicely.' Something broke<br> In the tired voice that quavered to a choke.<br> She half looked up. 'We mothers are so proud<br> Of our dead soldiers.' Then her face was bowed.<br> <br> Quietly the Brother Officer went out.<br> He'd told the poor old dear some gallant lies<br> That she would nourish all her days, no doubt.<br> For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes<br> Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,<br> Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy.<br> <br> He thought how 'Jack', cold-footed, useless swine,<br> Had panicked down the trench that night the mine<br> Went up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried <br> To get sent home, and how, at last, he died,<br> Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care <br> Except that lonely woman with white hair.</p>"}
