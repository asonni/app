How happy we are,<br> When we live in a Sieve and a crockery-jar,<br> And all night long in the moonlight pale,<br> We sail away with a pea-green sail,<br> In the shade of the mountains brown!'<br> Far and few, far and few,<br> Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br> Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br> And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br><br> <br> V <br> They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,<br> To a land all covered with trees,<br> And they bought an Owl, and a useful Cart,<br> And a pound of Rice, and a Cranberry Tart,<br> And a hive of silvery Bees.<br> And they bought a Pig, and some green Jack-daws,<br> And a lovely Monkey with lollipop paws,<br> And forty bottles of Ring-Bo-Ree,<br> And no end of Stilton Cheese.<br> Far and few, far and few,<br> Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br> Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br> And they went to sea in a Sieve.<br><br> <br> VI <br> And in twenty years they all came back,<br> In twenty years or more,<br> And every one said, 'How tall they've grown!<br> For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,<br> And the hills of the Chankly Bore!'<br> And they drank their health, and gave them a feast<br> Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;<br> And every one said, 'If we only live,<br> We too will go to sea in a Sieve,---<br> To the hills of the Chankly Bore!'<br> Far and few, far and few,<br> Are the lands where the Jumblies live;<br> Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,<br> And they went to sea in a Sieve."
