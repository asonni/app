There shall be<br> In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;<br> A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,<br> Gave once her flowers to love, her ways to roam;<br> A body of England's, breathing English air,<br> Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.<br> And think, this heart, all evil shed away,<br> A pulse in the eternal mind, no less<br> Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;<br> Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;<br> And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,<br> In hearts at peace, under an English heaven."
