						},"shuffle": "true","main_text":"Scene: The Mississippi Valley Time: Forty to fifty years ago<br><br> <br> CHAPTER I.<br><br> YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The<br> Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made<br> by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things<br> which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I<br> never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt<br> Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she<br> is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which<br> is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.<br><br> Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money<br> that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six<br> thousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when<br> it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out<br> at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year<br> round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas<br> she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was<br> rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular<br> and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand<br> it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead<br> again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and<br> said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I<br> would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.<br><br> The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she<br> called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by<br> it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but<br> sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing<br> commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come<br> to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but<br> you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little<br> over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with<br> them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a<br> barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the<br> juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.<br><br> After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the<br> Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and<br> by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so<br> then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in<br> dead people.<br><br> Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she<br> wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must<br> try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They<br> get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she was<br> a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,<br> being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a<br> thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that<br> was all right, because she done it herself.<br><br> Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,<br> had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a<br> spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then<br> the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for<br> an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,<br> ‘Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;’ and ‘Don't scrunch up<br> like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;’ and pretty soon she would<br> say, ‘Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to<br> behave?’ Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished<br> I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted<br> was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.<br> She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for<br> the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.<br> Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I<br> made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it<br> would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.<br><br> Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good<br> place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all<br> day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think<br> much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer<br> would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad<br> about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.<br><br> Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.<br> By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then<br> everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,<br> and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and<br> tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt<br> so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the<br> leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away<br> off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a<br> dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying<br> to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so<br> it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard<br> that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about<br> something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so<br> can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night<br> grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some<br> company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I<br> flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it<br> was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was<br> an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared<br> and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my<br> tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied<br> up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But<br> I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that<br> you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever<br> heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed<br> a spider.<br><br> I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;<br> for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't<br> know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town<br> go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than<br> ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the<br> trees--something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I<br> could just barely hear a ‘me-yow! me-yow!’ down there. That was good!<br> Says I, ‘me-yow! me-yow!’ as soft as I could, and then I put out the<br> light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped<br> down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,<br> there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER II.<br><br> WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of<br> the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our<br> heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made<br> a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big nigger,<br> named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty<br> clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched<br> his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:<br><br> ‘Who dah?’<br><br> He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right<br> between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was<br> minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close<br> together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I<br> dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,<br> right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.<br> Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with<br> the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't<br> sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why<br> you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim<br> says:<br><br> ‘Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.<br> Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and<br> listen tell I hears it agin.’<br><br> So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up<br> against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched<br> one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into<br> my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside.<br> Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set<br> still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but<br> it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different<br> places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,<br> but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun<br> to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon<br> comfortable again.<br><br> Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we<br> went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom<br> whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said<br> no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I<br> warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip<br> in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim<br> might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there<br> and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.<br> Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do<br> Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play<br> something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was<br> so still and lonesome.<br><br> As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,<br> and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of<br> the house. Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it<br> on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.<br> Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,<br> and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,<br> and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told<br> it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every<br> time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they<br> rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back<br> was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he<br> got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come<br> miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any<br> nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths<br> open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is<br> always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but<br> whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,<br> Jim would happen in and say, ‘Hm! What you know 'bout witches?’ and<br> that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept<br> that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a<br> charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could<br> cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by<br> saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.<br> Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they<br> had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch<br> it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for<br> a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil<br> and been rode by witches.<br><br> Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down<br> into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where<br> there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever<br> so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and<br> awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and<br> Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.<br> So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,<br> to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.<br><br> We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the<br> secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest<br> part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our<br> hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave<br> opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked<br> under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We<br> went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and<br> sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:<br><br> ‘Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.<br> Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name<br> in blood.’<br><br> Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had<br> wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the<br> band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to<br> any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and<br> his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he<br> had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign<br> of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that<br> mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be<br> killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he<br> must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the<br> ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with<br> blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it<br> and be forgot forever.<br><br> Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got<br> it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of<br> pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had<br> it.<br><br> Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told<br> the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote<br> it in. Then Ben Rogers says:<br><br> ‘Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout<br> him?’<br><br> ‘Well, hain't he got a father?’ says Tom Sawyer.<br><br> ‘Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He<br> used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen<br> in these parts for a year or more.’<br><br> They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they<br> said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it<br> wouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of<br> anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready<br> to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss<br> Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said:<br><br> ‘Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in.’<br><br> Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,<br> and I made my mark on the paper.<br><br> ‘Now,’ says Ben Rogers, ‘what's the line of business of this Gang?’<br><br> ‘Nothing only robbery and murder,’ Tom said.<br><br> ‘But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--’<br><br> ‘Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,’<br> says Tom Sawyer. ‘We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We<br> are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks<br> on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.’<br><br> ‘Must we always kill the people?’<br><br> ‘Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but<br> mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to<br> the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.’<br><br> ‘Ransomed? What's that?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books; and so<br> of course that's what we've got to do.’<br><br> ‘But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?’<br><br> ‘Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it. Don't I tell you it's in the<br> books? Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,<br> and get things all muddled up?’<br><br> ‘Oh, that's all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation<br> are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it<br> to them?--that's the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it<br> is?’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,<br> it means that we keep them till they're dead.’<br><br> ‘Now, that's something _like_. That'll answer. Why couldn't you said<br> that before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a<br> bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying<br> to get loose.’<br><br> ‘How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard<br> over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?’<br><br> ‘A guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody's got to set up all night<br> and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that's<br> foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as<br> they get here?’<br><br> ‘Because it ain't in the books so--that's why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you<br> want to do things regular, or don't you?--that's the idea. Don't you<br> reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct<br> thing to do? Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything? Not by a good<br> deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.’<br><br> ‘All right. I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. Say, do<br> we kill the women, too?’<br><br> ‘Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill<br> the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You<br> fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;<br> and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any<br> more.’<br><br> ‘Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.<br> Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows<br> waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers.<br> But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say.’<br><br> Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was<br> scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't<br> want to be a robber any more.<br><br> So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him<br> mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But<br> Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and<br> meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.<br><br> Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted<br> to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it<br> on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and<br> fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first<br> captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.<br><br> I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was<br> breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was<br> dog-tired.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER III.<br><br> WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on<br> account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned<br> off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would<br> behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet<br> and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and<br> whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I tried it.<br> Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't any good to me without<br> hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I<br> couldn't make it work. By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to<br> try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I<br> couldn't make it out no way.<br><br> I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.<br> I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't<br> Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the widow get<br> back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson fat up?<br> No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told the<br> widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for<br> it was ‘spiritual gifts.’ This was too many for me, but she told me<br> what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for<br> other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about<br> myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the<br> woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no<br> advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned<br> I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the<br> widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make<br> a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold<br> and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two<br> Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the<br> widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help<br> for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong<br> to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was<br> a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was<br> so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.<br><br> Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable<br> for me; I didn't want to see him no more. He used to always whale me<br> when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take<br> to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time<br> he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so<br> people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was<br> just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all<br> like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had<br> been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. They said<br> he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him<br> on the bank. But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think<br> of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on<br> his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but<br> a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. So I was uncomfortable again.<br> I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he<br> wouldn't.<br><br> We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All<br> the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but<br> only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging<br> down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,<br> but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs ‘ingots,’<br> and he called the turnips and stuff ‘julery,’ and we would go to the<br> cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed<br> and marked. But I couldn't see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a<br> boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan<br> (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he<br> had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish<br> merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two<br> hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand ‘sumter’<br> mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard<br> of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called<br> it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up<br> our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a<br> turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it,<br> though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them<br> till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more<br> than what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd<br> of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants,<br> so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got<br> the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't<br> no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants.<br> It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class<br> at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we<br> never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got<br> a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the<br> teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.<br><br> I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was<br> loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,<br> and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He<br> said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I<br> would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He<br> said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,<br> and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had<br> turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.<br> I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the<br> magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.<br><br> ‘Why,’ said he, ‘a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they<br> would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They<br> are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ I says, ‘s'pose we got some genies to help _us_--can't we lick<br> the other crowd then?’<br><br> ‘How you going to get them?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. How do _they_ get them?’<br><br> ‘Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies<br> come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the<br> smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it.<br> They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and<br> belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or any<br> other man.’<br><br> ‘Who makes them tear around so?’<br><br> ‘Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs<br> the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says. If he<br> tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fill<br> it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's<br> daughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do it--and they've<br> got to do it before sun-up next morning, too. And more: they've got<br> to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you<br> understand.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ says I, ‘I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping<br> the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that. And what's<br> more--if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would<br> drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.’<br><br> ‘How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you'd _have_ to come when he rubbed it,<br> whether you wanted to or not.’<br><br> ‘What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then;<br> I _would_ come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there<br> was in the country.’<br><br> ‘Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don't seem to<br> know anything, somehow--perfect saphead.’<br><br> I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I<br> would see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an<br> iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat<br> like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't<br> no use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff<br> was only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. I reckoned he believed in the<br> A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all<br> the marks of a Sunday-school.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER IV.<br><br> WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter<br> now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and<br> write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six<br> times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any<br> further than that if I was to live forever. I don't take no stock in<br> mathematics, anyway.<br><br> At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.<br> Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next<br> day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school the<br> easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways,<br> too, and they warn't so raspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in<br> a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I<br> used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a<br> rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the<br> new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but<br> sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn't ashamed of me.<br><br> One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.<br> I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left<br> shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,<br> and crossed me off. She says, ‘Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what<br> a mess you are always making!’ The widow put in a good word for me, but<br> that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.<br> I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and<br> wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.<br> There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one<br> of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along<br> low-spirited and on the watch-out.<br><br> I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go<br> through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the<br> ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. They had come up from the quarry<br> and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden<br> fence. It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so. I<br> couldn't make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to<br> follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn't<br> notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left<br> boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.<br><br> I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my<br> shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. I was at Judge<br> Thatcher's as quick as I could get there. He said:<br><br> ‘Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your<br> interest?’<br><br> ‘No, sir,’ I says; ‘is there some for me?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night--over a hundred and fifty<br> dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest it<br> along with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it.’<br><br> ‘No, sir,’ I says, ‘I don't want to spend it. I don't want it at<br> all--nor the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give<br> it to you--the six thousand and all.’<br><br> He looked surprised. He couldn't seem to make it out. He says:<br><br> ‘Why, what can you mean, my boy?’<br><br> I says, ‘Don't you ask me no questions about it, please. You'll take<br> it--won't you?’<br><br> He says:<br><br> ‘Well, I'm puzzled. Is something the matter?’<br><br> ‘Please take it,’ says I, ‘and don't ask me nothing--then I won't have to<br> tell no lies.’<br><br> He studied a while, and then he says:<br><br> ‘Oho-o! I think I see. You want to _sell_ all your property to me--not<br> give it. That's the correct idea.’<br><br> Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:<br><br> ‘There; you see it says 'for a consideration.' That means I have bought<br> it of you and paid you for it. Here's a dollar for you. Now you sign<br> it.’<br><br> So I signed it, and left.<br><br> Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which<br> had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do<br> magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed<br> everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here<br> again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know was,<br> what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his<br> hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped<br> it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.<br> Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.<br> Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.<br> But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it<br> wouldn't talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit<br> quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver<br> a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show,<br> because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it<br> every time. (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got<br> from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball<br> would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference. Jim smelt<br> it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball<br> would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato<br> and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next<br> morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more,<br> and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.<br> Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.<br><br> Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened<br> again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it<br> would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the<br> hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says:<br><br> ‘Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do. Sometimes he<br> spec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll stay. De bes' way is to<br> res' easy en let de ole man take his own way. Dey's two angels hoverin'<br> roun' 'bout him. One uv 'em is white en shiny, en t'other one is black.<br> De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail<br> in en bust it all up. A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch<br> him at de las'. But you is all right. You gwyne to have considable<br> trouble in yo' life, en considable joy. Sometimes you gwyne to git<br> hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you's gwyne<br> to git well agin. Dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life. One<br> uv 'em's light en t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is po'.<br> You's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by. You<br> wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don't run no<br> resk, 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung.’<br><br> When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his<br> own self!<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER V.<br><br> I had shut the door to. Then I turned around and there he was. I used<br> to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I<br> was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken--that is, after<br> the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being<br> so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't scared of him worth<br> bothring about.<br><br> He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled and<br> greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through<br> like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long,<br> mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no color in his face, where his face<br> showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make<br> a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl--a tree-toad white, a<br> fish-belly white. As for his clothes--just rags, that was all. He had<br> one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and<br> two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. His hat<br> was laying on the floor--an old black slouch with the top caved in, like<br> a lid.<br><br> I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair<br> tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the window was<br> up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. By<br> and by he says:<br><br> ‘Starchy clothes--very. You think you're a good deal of a big-bug,<br> _don't_ you?’<br><br> ‘Maybe I am, maybe I ain't,’ I says.<br><br> ‘Don't you give me none o' your lip,’ says he. ‘You've put on<br> considerable many frills since I been away. I'll take you down a peg<br> before I get done with you. You're educated, too, they say--can read and<br> write. You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because<br> he can't? _I'll_ take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle<br> with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?--who told you you could?’<br><br> ‘The widow. She told me.’<br><br> ‘The widow, hey?--and who told the widow she could put in her shovel<br> about a thing that ain't none of her business?’<br><br> ‘Nobody never told her.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'll learn her how to meddle. And looky here--you drop that<br> school, you hear? I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs<br> over his own father and let on to be better'n what _he_ is. You lemme<br> catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother<br> couldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died. None<br> of the family couldn't before _they_ died. I can't; and here you're<br> a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain't the man to stand it--you hear?<br> Say, lemme hear you read.’<br><br> I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the<br> wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack<br> with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:<br><br> ‘It's so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky<br> here; you stop that putting on frills. I won't have it. I'll lay for<br> you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I'll tan you good.<br> First you know you'll get religion, too. I never see such a son.’<br><br> He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and<br> says:<br><br> ‘What's this?’<br><br> ‘It's something they give me for learning my lessons good.’<br><br> He tore it up, and says:<br><br> ‘I'll give you something better--I'll give you a cowhide.’<br><br> He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:<br><br> ‘_Ain't_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and<br> a look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor--and your own father<br> got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a son. I<br> bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you.<br> Why, there ain't no end to your airs--they say you're rich. Hey?--how's<br> that?’<br><br> ‘They lie--that's how.’<br><br> ‘Looky here--mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can<br> stand now--so don't gimme no sass. I've been in town two days, and I<br> hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich. I heard about it<br> away down the river, too. That's why I come. You git me that money<br> to-morrow--I want it.’<br><br> ‘I hain't got no money.’<br><br> ‘It's a lie. Judge Thatcher's got it. You git it. I want it.’<br><br> ‘I hain't got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge Thatcher; he'll tell<br> you the same.’<br><br> ‘All right. I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll know<br> the reason why. Say, how much you got in your pocket? I want it.’<br><br> ‘I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to--’<br><br> ‘It don't make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it<br> out.’<br><br> He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was<br> going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day.<br> When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed<br> me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I<br> reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me<br> to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick<br> me if I didn't drop that.<br><br> Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged<br> him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then<br> he swore he'd make the law force him.<br><br> The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away<br> from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that<br> had just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't<br> interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther<br> not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and the widow<br> had to quit on the business.<br><br> That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. He said he'd cowhide<br> me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him. I<br> borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got<br> drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying<br> on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;<br> then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed<br> him again for a week. But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss<br> of his son, and he'd make it warm for _him_.<br><br> When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.<br> So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and<br> had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just<br> old pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about<br> temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been<br> a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over<br> a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the<br> judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he could<br> hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap<br> said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the<br> judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man wanted<br> that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried<br> again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his<br> hand, and says:<br><br> ‘Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.<br> There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more; it's<br> the hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and'll die before<br> he'll go back. You mark them words--don't forget I said them. It's a<br> clean hand now; shake it--don't be afeard.’<br><br> So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The<br> judge's wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge--made<br> his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something<br> like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was<br> the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and<br> clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his<br> new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old<br> time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and<br> rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most<br> froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. And when they come<br> to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could<br> navigate it.<br><br> The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform<br> the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VI.<br><br> WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went<br> for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he<br> went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of<br> times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged<br> him or outrun him most of the time. I didn't want to go to school much<br> before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a<br> slow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it;<br> so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge<br> for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he<br> got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and<br> every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited--this kind<br> of thing was right in his line.<br><br> He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told him at<br> last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble<br> for him. Well, _wasn't_ he mad? He said he would show who was Huck<br> Finn's boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and<br> catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and<br> crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't<br> no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick<br> you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.<br><br> He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.<br> We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the<br> key under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,<br> and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little<br> while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the<br> ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got<br> drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where<br> I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but<br> pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was<br> used to being where I was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.<br><br> It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking<br> and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and<br> my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever<br> got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on<br> a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever<br> bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the<br> time. I didn't want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because<br> the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't<br> no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it<br> all around.<br><br> But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand<br> it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and<br> locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was<br> dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever<br> going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix<br> up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many<br> a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window to it big<br> enough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it<br> was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty<br> careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;<br> I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I<br> was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in<br> the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty<br> wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the<br> clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an<br> old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin<br> behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and<br> putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket,<br> and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough<br> to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting<br> towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of<br> the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty<br> soon pap come in.<br><br> Pap warn't in a good humor--so he was his natural self. He said he was<br> down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned<br> he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on<br> the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge<br> Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd be<br> another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my<br> guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up<br> considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more<br> and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man<br> got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,<br> and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any,<br> and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,<br> including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names<br> of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went<br> right along with his cussing.<br><br> He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch<br> out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place<br> six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they<br> dropped and they couldn't find me. That made me pretty uneasy again,<br> but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got<br> that chance.<br><br> The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had<br> got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,<br> ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two<br> newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went<br> back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all<br> over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and<br> take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn't stay in one<br> place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and<br> hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor<br> the widow couldn't ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and<br> leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I<br> got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old<br> man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.<br><br> I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While<br> I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of<br> warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town,<br> and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body<br> would a thought he was Adam--he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor<br> begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:<br><br> ‘Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like.<br> Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him--a<br> man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety<br> and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that<br> son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for<br> _him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call<br> _that_ govment! That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge<br> Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property. Here's what<br> the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and<br> up'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets<br> him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that<br> govment! A man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes<br> I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,<br> and I _told_ 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of 'em<br> heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I'd leave the<br> blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them's the very words. I<br> says look at my hat--if you call it a hat--but the lid raises up and the<br> rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly<br> a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o'<br> stove-pipe. Look at it, says I--such a hat for me to wear--one of the<br> wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here.<br> There was a free nigger there from Ohio--a mulatter, most as white as<br> a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the<br> shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine<br> clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a<br> silver-headed cane--the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And<br> what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could<br> talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the<br> wust. They said he could _vote_ when he was at home. Well, that let me<br> out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day,<br> and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get<br> there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where<br> they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin.<br> Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may<br> rot for all me--I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the<br> cool way of that nigger--why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't<br> shoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger<br> put up at auction and sold?--that's what I want to know. And what do you<br> reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in<br> the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There,<br> now--that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free<br> nigger till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that<br> calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a<br> govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before<br> it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free<br> nigger, and--’<br><br> Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was<br> taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and<br> barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind<br> of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give<br> the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the<br> cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding<br> first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his<br> left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it<br> warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his<br> toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that<br> fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and<br> rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over<br> anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards.<br> He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid<br> over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.<br><br> After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there<br> for two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I<br> judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal<br> the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. He drank and drank, and<br> tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way.<br> He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and<br> thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so<br> sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I<br> knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.<br><br> I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an<br> awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping<br> around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was<br> crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say<br> one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes. He started<br> and run round and round the cabin, hollering ‘Take him off! take him<br> off! he's biting me on the neck!’ I never see a man look so wild in the<br> eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he<br> rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,<br> and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and<br> saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid<br> still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.<br> I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it<br> seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he<br> raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says,<br> very low:<br><br> ‘Tramp--tramp--tramp; that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're coming<br> after me; but I won't go. Oh, they're here! don't touch me--don't! hands<br> off--they're cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!’<br><br> Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him<br> alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the<br> old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could<br> hear him through the blanket.<br><br> By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he<br> see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a<br> clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,<br> and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I<br> was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and<br> cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and<br> dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my<br> shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick<br> as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and<br> dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a<br> minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would<br> sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.<br><br> So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom chair<br> and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the<br> gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I<br> laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down<br> behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did<br> drag along.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VII.<br><br> ‘GIT up! What you 'bout?’<br><br> I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It<br> was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me<br> looking sour and sick, too. He says:<br><br> ‘What you doin' with this gun?’<br><br> I judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:<br><br> ‘Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.’<br><br> ‘Why didn't you roust me out?’<br><br> ‘Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you.’<br><br> ‘Well, all right. Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with<br> you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast. I'll be along<br> in a minute.’<br><br> He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed<br> some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of<br> bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have<br> great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be<br> always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes<br> cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs<br> together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the<br> wood-yards and the sawmill.<br><br> I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out<br> for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a<br> canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding<br> high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,<br> clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected<br> there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that<br> to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd<br> raise up and laugh at him. But it warn't so this time. It was a<br> drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks<br> I, the old man will be glad when he sees this--she's worth ten dollars.<br> But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running<br> her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and<br> willows, I struck another idea: I judged I'd hide her good, and then,<br> 'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river<br> about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a<br> rough time tramping on foot.<br><br> It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man<br> coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around<br> a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just<br> drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn't seen anything.<br><br> When he got along I was hard at it taking up a ‘trot’ line. He abused<br> me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and<br> that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and<br> then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines<br> and went home.<br><br> While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about<br> wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap<br> and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing<br> than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you<br> see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn't see no way for a<br> while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of<br> water, and he says:<br><br> ‘Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you<br> hear? That man warn't here for no good. I'd a shot him. Next time you<br> roust me out, you hear?’<br><br> Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been<br> saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it<br> now so nobody won't think of following me.<br><br> About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The<br> river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the<br> rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.<br> We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner.<br> Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch<br> more stuff; but that warn't pap's style. Nine logs was enough for one<br> time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and<br> took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.<br> I judged he wouldn't come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he<br> had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that<br> log again. Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the<br> hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.<br><br> I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and<br> shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same<br> with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee and<br> sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the<br> bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two<br> blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and<br> matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned<br> out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out<br> at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched<br> out the gun, and now I was done.<br><br> I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging<br> out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside<br> by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the<br> sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two<br> rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up<br> at that place and didn't quite touch ground. If you stood four or five<br> foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice<br> it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely<br> anybody would go fooling around there.<br><br> It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track. I<br> followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the<br> river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,<br> and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon<br> went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie<br> farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.<br><br> I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it<br> considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly<br> to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down<br> on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,<br> and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks<br> in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to<br> the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and<br> down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been<br> dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he<br> would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy<br> touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as<br> that.<br><br> Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and<br> stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I<br> took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't<br> drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into<br> the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag<br> of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.<br> I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the<br> bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the<br> place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then<br> I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through<br> the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide<br> and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There<br> was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went<br> miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. The meal<br> sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped<br> pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by<br> accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it<br> wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.<br><br> It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some<br> willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I<br> made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid<br> down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,<br> they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then<br> drag the river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to the lake<br> and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers<br> that killed me and took the things. They won't ever hunt the river for<br> anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't<br> bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.<br> Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,<br> and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights,<br> and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the<br> place.<br><br> I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When<br> I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked<br> around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and<br> miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs<br> that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from<br> shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.<br> You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.<br><br> I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start<br> when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I<br> made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from<br> oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. I peeped out through<br> the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.<br> I couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was<br> abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. Think's I, maybe<br> it's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He dropped below me with the<br> current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,<br> and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.<br> Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his<br> oars.<br><br> I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream<br> soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half,<br> and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of<br> the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and<br> people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and<br> then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.<br><br> I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking<br> away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when<br> you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.<br> And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people<br> talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word<br> of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short<br> nights now. T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he<br> reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they<br> laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and<br> laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said<br> let him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his<br> old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't<br> nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it<br> was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than<br> about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away,<br> and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,<br> and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.<br><br> I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson's<br> Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and<br> standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like<br> a steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar at<br> the head--it was all under water now.<br><br> It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping<br> rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and<br> landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into<br> a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow<br> branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe<br> from the outside.<br><br> I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked<br> out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,<br> three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A<br> monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,<br> with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down,<br> and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, ‘Stern<br> oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!’ I heard that just as plain<br> as if the man was by my side.<br><br> There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and<br> laid down for a nap before breakfast.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VIII.<br><br> THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight<br> o'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about<br> things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I<br> could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees<br> all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places<br> on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the<br> freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little<br> breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me<br> very friendly.<br><br> I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook<br> breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep<br> sound of ‘boom!’ away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow<br> and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and<br> looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying<br> on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry. And there was the<br> ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the<br> matter now. ‘Boom!’ I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's<br> side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my<br> carcass come to the top.<br><br> I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,<br> because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the<br> cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there,<br> and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good<br> enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to<br> eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in<br> loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the<br> drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and<br> if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show. I<br> changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could<br> have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I<br> most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out<br> further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the<br> shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one,<br> and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab<br> of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was ‘baker's bread’--what the<br> quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.<br><br> I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching<br> the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And<br> then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson<br> or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone<br> and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that<br> thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the<br> parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for<br> only just the right kind.<br><br> I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The<br> ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance<br> to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in<br> close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down<br> towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,<br> and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where<br> the log forked I could peep through.<br><br> By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could<br> a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.<br> Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom<br> Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.<br> Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and<br> says:<br><br> ‘Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's<br> washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I<br> hope so, anyway.’<br><br> I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly<br> in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see<br> them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out:<br><br> ‘Stand away!’ and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that<br> it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and<br> I judged I was gone. If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd<br> a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to<br> goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder<br> of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and<br> further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.<br> The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and<br> was giving it up. But they didn't yet a while. They turned around<br> the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,<br> under steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over<br> to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the<br> island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and<br> went home to the town.<br><br> I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after<br> me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick<br> woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things<br> under so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled<br> him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had<br> supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.<br><br> When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well<br> satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set<br> on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the<br> stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;<br> there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you<br> can't stay so, you soon get over it.<br><br> And so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing.<br> But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was<br> boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know<br> all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty<br> strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green<br> razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They<br> would all come handy by and by, I judged.<br><br> Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't<br> far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot<br> nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh<br> home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,<br> and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after<br> it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I<br> bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.<br><br> My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look<br> further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as<br> fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the<br> thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear<br> nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;<br> and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod<br> on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my<br> breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.<br><br> When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand<br> in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I<br> got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,<br> and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an<br> old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.<br><br> I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,<br> I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a<br> thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I<br> got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the<br> time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from<br> breakfast.<br><br> By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good<br> and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the<br> Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and<br> cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there<br> all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says<br> to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got<br> everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping<br> through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far when I<br> hear a man say:<br><br> ‘We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about<br> beat out. Let's look around.’<br><br> I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the<br> old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.<br><br> I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time<br> I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't<br> do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm<br> a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll<br> find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.<br><br> So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and<br> then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was<br> shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.<br> I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound<br> asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A<br> little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying<br> the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung<br> her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge<br> of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the<br> leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket<br> the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,<br> and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards<br> where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two<br> to listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the<br> place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away<br> through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was<br> close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It<br> most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his<br> head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in<br> about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting<br> gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove<br> off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see<br> him. I says:<br><br> ‘Hello, Jim!’ and skipped out.<br><br> He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees,<br> and puts his hands together and says:<br><br> ‘Doan' hurt me--don't! I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'. I alwuz<br> liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. You go en git in de<br> river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz<br> awluz yo' fren'.’<br><br> Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever so<br> glad to see Jim. I warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't afraid of<br> _him_ telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set<br> there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:<br><br> ‘It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.’<br><br> ‘What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich<br> truck? But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin git sumfn better den<br> strawbries.’<br><br> ‘Strawberries and such truck,’ I says. ‘Is that what you live on?’<br><br> ‘I couldn' git nuffn else,’ he says.<br><br> ‘Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?’<br><br> ‘I come heah de night arter you's killed.’<br><br> ‘What, all that time?’<br><br> ‘Yes--indeedy.’<br><br> ‘And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?’<br><br> ‘No, sah--nuffn else.’<br><br> ‘Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?’<br><br> ‘I reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de<br> islan'?’<br><br> ‘Since the night I got killed.’<br><br> ‘No! W'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got<br> a gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.’<br><br> So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in<br> a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and<br> coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the<br> nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done<br> with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him<br> with his knife, and fried him.<br><br> When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.<br> Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then<br> when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and by<br> Jim says:<br><br> ‘But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it<br> warn't you?’<br><br> Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom<br> Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:<br><br> ‘How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?’<br><br> He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he<br> says:<br><br> ‘Maybe I better not tell.’<br><br> ‘Why, Jim?’<br><br> ‘Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you,<br> would you, Huck?’<br><br> ‘Blamed if I would, Jim.’<br><br> ‘Well, I b'lieve you, Huck. I--_I run off_.’<br><br> ‘Jim!’<br><br> ‘But mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell,<br> Huck.’<br><br> ‘Well, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. Honest _injun_,<br> I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for<br> keeping mum--but that don't make no difference. I ain't a-going to tell,<br> and I ain't a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le's know all about<br> it.’<br><br> ‘Well, you see, it 'uz dis way. Ole missus--dat's Miss Watson--she pecks<br> on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she<br> wouldn' sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader<br> roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one<br> night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I<br> hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but<br> she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it<br> 'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'. De widder she try to<br> git her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'. I<br> lit out mighty quick, I tell you.<br><br> ‘I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de<br> sho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid<br> in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to<br> go 'way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time.<br> 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er<br> nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over<br> to de town en say you's killed. Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en<br> genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place. Sometimes dey'd pull up at<br> de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to<br> know all 'bout de killin'. I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but<br> I ain't no mo' now.<br><br> ‘I laid dah under de shavin's all day. I 'uz hungry, but I warn't<br> afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to<br> de camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows<br> I goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me<br> roun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'.<br> De yuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday<br> soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way.<br><br> ‘Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout two<br> mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses. I'd made up my mine 'bout<br> what I's agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away afoot,<br> de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss dat<br> skift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, en<br> whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it doan'<br> _make_ no track.<br><br> ‘I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove'<br> a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river, en got in<br> 'mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum agin de<br> current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck<br> a-holt. It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb<br> up en laid down on de planks. De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle,<br> whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current;<br> so I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down de<br> river, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim asho', en take to<br> de woods on de Illinois side.<br><br> ‘But I didn' have no luck. When we 'uz mos' down to de head er de<br> islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it warn't no use<br> fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'. Well, I<br> had a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't--bank too bluff.<br> I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good place. I went<br> into de woods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as dey<br> move de lantern roun' so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some<br> matches in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all right.’<br><br> ‘And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why<br> didn't you get mud-turkles?’<br><br> ‘How you gwyne to git 'm? You can't slip up on um en grab um; en how's<br> a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night?<br> En I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in de daytime.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's so. You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of<br> course. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah--watched um<br> thoo de bushes.’<br><br> Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and<br> lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was<br> a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the<br> same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them,<br> but Jim wouldn't let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid<br> mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny<br> said his father would die, and he did.<br><br> And Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook for<br> dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the<br> table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive<br> and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next<br> morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.<br> Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because<br> I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.<br><br> I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim<br> knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said<br> it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked<br> him if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says:<br><br> ‘Mighty few--an' _dey_ ain't no use to a body. What you want to know<br> when good luck's a-comin' for? Want to keep it off?’ And he said: ‘Ef<br> you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat you's agwyne<br> to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase it's so fur<br> ahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en so you<br> might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat<br> you gwyne to be rich bymeby.’<br><br> ‘Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?’<br><br> ‘What's de use to ax dat question? Don't you see I has?’<br><br> ‘Well, are you rich?’<br><br> ‘No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had<br> foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out.’<br><br> ‘What did you speculate in, Jim?’<br><br> ‘Well, fust I tackled stock.’<br><br> ‘What kind of stock?’<br><br> ‘Why, live stock--cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But<br> I ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock. De cow up 'n' died on my<br> han's.’<br><br> ‘So you lost the ten dollars.’<br><br> ‘No, I didn't lose it all. I on'y los' 'bout nine of it. I sole de<br> hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.’<br><br> ‘You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?’<br><br> ‘Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto<br> Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar<br> would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year. Well, all de niggers<br> went in, but dey didn't have much. I wuz de on'y one dat had much. So<br> I stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd<br> start a bank mysef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er<br> de business, bekase he says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so<br> he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en'<br> er de year.<br><br> ‘So I done it. Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five dollars right<br> off en keep things a-movin'. Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat had<br> ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it off'n<br> him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er de<br> year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de<br> one-laigged nigger say de bank's busted. So dey didn' none uv us git no<br> money.’<br><br> ‘What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?’<br><br> ‘Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me<br> to give it to a nigger name' Balum--Balum's Ass dey call him for short;<br> he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he's lucky, dey say, en I<br> see I warn't lucky. De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he'd<br> make a raise for me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in<br> church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de<br> Lord, en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times. So Balum he tuck<br> en give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to<br> come of it.’<br><br> ‘Well, what did come of it, Jim?’<br><br> ‘Nuffn never come of it. I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way;<br> en Balum he couldn'. I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see de<br> security. Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de preacher says!<br> Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back, I'd call it squah, en be glad er de<br> chanst.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich again<br> some time or other.’<br><br> ‘Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. I owns mysef, en I's wuth<br> eight hund'd dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn' want no mo'.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER IX.<br><br> I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island<br> that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,<br> because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile<br> wide.<br><br> This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot<br> high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and<br> the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by<br> and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the<br> side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms<br> bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in<br> there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we<br> didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.<br><br> Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps<br> in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,<br> and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them<br> little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to<br> get wet?<br><br> So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,<br> and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by<br> to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off<br> of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.<br><br> The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one<br> side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a<br> good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.<br><br> We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.<br> We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty<br> soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was<br> right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,<br> too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular<br> summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black<br> outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that<br> the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would<br> come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the<br> pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would<br> follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they<br> was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and<br> blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little<br> glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,<br> hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again<br> in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,<br> and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the<br> under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs--where<br> it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.<br><br> ‘Jim, this is nice,’ I says. ‘I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but<br> here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.’<br><br> ‘Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim. You'd a ben<br> down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too;<br> dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so do<br> de birds, chile.’<br><br> The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at<br> last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on<br> the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side<br> it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same<br> old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore was just a<br> wall of high bluffs.<br><br> Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool<br> and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We<br> went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung<br> so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old<br> broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and<br> when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on<br> account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your<br> hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles--they would<br> slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.<br> We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.<br><br> One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft--nice pine planks.<br> It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and<br> the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid, level floor. We<br> could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;<br> we didn't show ourselves in daylight.<br><br> Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before<br> daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was<br> a two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got<br> aboard--clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet,<br> so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.<br><br> The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then<br> we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and<br> two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there<br> was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the<br> floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:<br><br> ‘Hello, you!’<br><br> But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:<br><br> ‘De man ain't asleep--he's dead. You hold still--I'll go en see.’<br><br> He went, and bent down and looked, and says:<br><br> ‘It's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He's ben shot in de back.<br> I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look<br> at his face--it's too gashly.’<br><br> I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but<br> he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old<br> greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,<br> and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls<br> was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.<br> There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some<br> women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,<br> too. We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good. There was a<br> boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there<br> was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a<br> baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was<br> a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They<br> stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.<br> The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a<br> hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.<br><br> We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and<br> a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow<br> candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty<br> old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and<br> beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet<br> and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some<br> monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,<br> and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label<br> on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,<br> and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps<br> was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though<br> it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find<br> the other one, though we hunted all around.<br><br> And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to<br> shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty<br> broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the<br> quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good<br> ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most<br> a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and<br> hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. We got home all safe.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER X.<br><br> AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he<br> come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to. He said it would fetch bad<br> luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man<br> that warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one<br> that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so<br> I didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and<br> wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.<br><br> We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver<br> sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned<br> the people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the<br> money was there they wouldn't a left it. I said I reckoned they killed<br> him, too; but Jim didn't want to talk about that. I says:<br><br> ‘Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the<br> snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?<br> You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin<br> with my hands. Well, here's your bad luck! We've raked in all this<br> truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck<br> like this every day, Jim.’<br><br> ‘Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don't you git too peart. It's<br> a-comin'. Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'.’<br><br> It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after<br> dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the<br> ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and<br> found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the<br> foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun<br> when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,<br> and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light<br> the snake's mate was there, and bit him.<br><br> He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the<br> varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a<br> second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour<br> it down.<br><br> He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all<br> comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave<br> a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told<br> me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the<br> body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it<br> would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around<br> his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet<br> and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going<br> to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.<br><br> Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his<br> head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he<br> went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and<br> so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged<br> he was all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's<br> whisky.<br><br> Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all<br> gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take<br> a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come<br> of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said<br> that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't<br> got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his<br> left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin<br> in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've<br> always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is<br> one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank<br> Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he<br> got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so<br> that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him<br> edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so<br> they say, but I didn't see it. Pap told me. But anyway it all come of<br> looking at the moon that way, like a fool.<br><br> Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks<br> again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big<br> hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was<br> as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two<br> hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us<br> into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around<br> till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round<br> ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,<br> and there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to<br> coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever<br> catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn't ever seen<br> a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.<br> They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house<br> there; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes<br> a good fry.<br><br> Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a<br> stirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and<br> find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I<br> must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,<br> couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?<br> That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico<br> gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim<br> hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the<br> sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in<br> and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said<br> nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around<br> all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty<br> well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said<br> I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. I took<br> notice, and done better.<br><br> I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.<br><br> I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and<br> the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I<br> tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a<br> little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered<br> who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the<br> window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by<br> a candle that was on a pine table. I didn't know her face; she was a<br> stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.<br> Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had<br> come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had<br> been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to<br> know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I<br> was a girl.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XI.<br><br> ‘COME in,’ says the woman, and I did. She says: ‘Take a cheer.’<br><br> I done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:<br><br> ‘What might your name be?’<br><br> ‘Sarah Williams.’<br><br> ‘Where 'bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?'<br><br> ‘No'm. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I've walked all the way and<br> I'm all tired out.’<br><br> ‘Hungry, too, I reckon. I'll find you something.’<br><br> ‘No'm, I ain't hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below<br> here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more. It's what makes me so late.<br> My mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to<br> tell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town, she<br> says. I hain't ever been here before. Do you know him?’<br><br> ‘No; but I don't know everybody yet. I haven't lived here quite two<br> weeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You<br> better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.’<br><br> ‘No,’ I says; ‘I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain't afeared<br> of the dark.’<br><br> She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in<br> by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me.<br> Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up<br> the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better<br> off they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake<br> coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,<br> till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what<br> was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the<br> murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.<br> She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only<br> she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what<br> a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered. I<br> says:<br><br> ‘Who done it? We've heard considerable about these goings on down in<br> Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn.’<br><br> ‘Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people _here_ that'd<br> like to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.’<br><br> ‘No--is that so?’<br><br> ‘Most everybody thought it at first. He'll never know how nigh he come<br> to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it<br> was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.’<br><br> ‘Why _he_--’<br><br> I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never<br> noticed I had put in at all:<br><br> ‘The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there's a<br> reward out for him--three hundred dollars. And there's a reward out for<br> old Finn, too--two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the<br> morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the<br> ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they<br> wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they<br> found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence<br> ten o'clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him,<br> you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,<br> and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the<br> nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening<br> he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty<br> hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain't<br> come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thing<br> blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and<br> fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get<br> Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.<br> People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he's sly, I reckon.<br> If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right. You can't prove<br> anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and<br> he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I reckon so, 'm. I don't see nothing in the way of it. Has<br> everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?’<br><br> ‘Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they'll get<br> the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.’<br><br> ‘Why, are they after him yet?’<br><br> ‘Well, you're innocent, ain't you! Does three hundred dollars lay<br> around every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger<br> ain't far from here. I'm one of them--but I hain't talked it around. A<br> few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in<br> the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to<br> that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't anybody<br> live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any more, but<br> I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over<br> there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says<br> to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says<br> I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain't seen any<br> smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's<br> going over to see--him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he<br> got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.’<br><br> I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I had to do something with my<br> hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading<br> it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman<br> stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious<br> and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to<br> be interested--and I was, too--and says:<br><br> ‘Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get<br> it. Is your husband going over there to-night?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a<br> boat and see if they could borrow another gun. They'll go over after<br> midnight.’<br><br> ‘Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?’<br><br> ‘Yes. And couldn't the nigger see better, too? After midnight he'll<br> likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up<br> his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he's got one.’<br><br> ‘I didn't think of that.’<br><br> The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit<br> comfortable. Pretty soon she says,<br><br> ‘What did you say your name was, honey?’<br><br> ‘M--Mary Williams.’<br><br> Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn't<br> look up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,<br> and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would<br> say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But<br> now she says:<br><br> ‘Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name. Some<br> calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.’<br><br> ‘Oh, that's the way of it?’<br><br> ‘Yes'm.’<br><br> I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I<br> couldn't look up yet.<br><br> Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor<br> they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the<br> place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right<br> about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner<br> every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at<br> them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed<br> me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot<br> with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't<br> know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance,<br> and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said<br> ‘Ouch!’ it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one.<br> I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course<br> I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his<br> nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a<br> tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I<br> would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched<br> it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help<br> her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and<br> went on talking about her and her husband's matters. But she broke off<br> to say:<br><br> ‘Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap,<br> handy.’<br><br> So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped<br> my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a<br> minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,<br> and very pleasant, and says:<br><br> ‘Come, now, what's your real name?’<br><br> ‘Wh--what, mum?’<br><br> ‘What's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?’<br><br> I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. But<br> I says:<br><br> ‘Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I'm in the<br> way here, I'll--’<br><br> ‘No, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going to hurt<br> you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your<br> secret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help<br> you. So'll my old man if you want him to. You see, you're a runaway<br> 'prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't no harm in it.<br> You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you,<br> child, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that's a good<br> boy.’<br><br> So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I<br> would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't<br> go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead,<br> and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty<br> mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it<br> no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my<br> chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and<br> I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights,<br> and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from<br> home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my<br> uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck<br> out for this town of Goshen.<br><br> ‘Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's<br> ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?’<br><br> ‘Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn<br> into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I<br> must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.’<br><br> ‘He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.’<br><br> ‘Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I got<br> to be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.’<br><br> ‘Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.’<br><br> So she put me up a snack, and says:<br><br> ‘Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer<br> up prompt now--don't stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?’<br><br> ‘The hind end, mum.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, a horse?’<br><br> ‘The for'rard end, mum.’<br><br> ‘Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?’<br><br> ‘North side.’<br><br> ‘If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with<br> their heads pointed the same direction?’<br><br> ‘The whole fifteen, mum.’<br><br> ‘Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country. I thought maybe you<br> was trying to hocus me again. What's your real name, now?’<br><br> ‘George Peters, mum.’<br><br> ‘Well, try to remember it, George. Don't forget and tell me it's<br> Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George<br> Elexander when I catch you. And don't go about women in that old<br> calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.<br> Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the<br> thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and<br> poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a<br> man always does t'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything,<br> hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as<br> awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw<br> stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to<br> turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out<br> to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch<br> anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them<br> together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I<br> spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived<br> the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle,<br> Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble<br> you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can<br> to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time<br> you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one,<br> and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.’<br><br> I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks<br> and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I<br> jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to<br> make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the<br> sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. When I was about the<br> middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the<br> sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven. When I struck the<br> head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but<br> I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started<br> a good fire there on a high and dry spot.<br><br> Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half<br> below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber<br> and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on<br> the ground. I roused him out and says:<br><br> ‘Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't a minute to lose. They're<br> after us!’<br><br> Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he<br> worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By<br> that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was<br> ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We<br> put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a<br> candle outside after that.<br><br> I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;<br> but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows<br> ain't good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down<br> in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never saying a<br> word.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XII.<br><br> IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at<br> last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come<br> along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois<br> shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to<br> put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We<br> was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't<br> good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.<br><br> If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I<br> built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed<br> away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no<br> fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.<br><br> When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a<br> big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with<br> the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there<br> had been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has<br> cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.<br><br> We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois<br> side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we<br> warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day,<br> and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and<br> up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all<br> about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was<br> a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set<br> down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then, I<br> said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he<br> bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he<br> believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that<br> time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile<br> below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.<br> So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long<br> as they didn't.<br><br> When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the<br> cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;<br> so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug<br> wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things<br> dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above<br> the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of<br> reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a<br> layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for<br> to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather<br> or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra<br> steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag<br> or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern<br> on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat<br> coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have<br> to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call<br> a ‘crossing’; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being<br> still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the<br> channel, but hunted easy water.<br><br> This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current<br> that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,<br> and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of<br> solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking<br> up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it<br> warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle. We<br> had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to<br> us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.<br><br> Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,<br> nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The<br> fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.<br> In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand<br> people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful<br> spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't a sound<br> there; everybody was asleep.<br><br> Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little<br> village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other<br> stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting<br> comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when<br> you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy<br> find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I never see<br> pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to<br> say, anyway.<br><br> Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a<br> watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of<br> that kind. Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you<br> was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't<br> anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.<br> Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly<br> right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things<br> from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned<br> it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all<br> one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds<br> whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,<br> or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and<br> concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We warn't feeling just<br> right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way<br> it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons<br> wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.<br><br> We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning<br> or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we<br> lived pretty high.<br><br> The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with<br> a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid<br> sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.<br> When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,<br> and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, ‘Hel-_lo_, Jim,<br> looky yonder!’ It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.<br> We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very<br> distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above<br> water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a<br> chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,<br> when the flashes come.<br><br> Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,<br> I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck<br> laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I<br> wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what<br> there was there. So I says:<br><br> ‘Le's land on her, Jim.’<br><br> But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:<br><br> ‘I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame' well,<br> en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not<br> dey's a watchman on dat wrack.’<br><br> ‘Watchman your grandmother,’ I says; ‘there ain't nothing to watch but<br> the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk<br> his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when<br> it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?’ Jim<br> couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try. ‘And besides,’ I says,<br> ‘we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.<br> Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat<br> captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't<br> care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a<br> candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.<br> Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he<br> wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd<br> land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't he throw style<br> into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you'd think it<br> was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer<br> _was_ here.’<br><br> Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any more<br> than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us<br> the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and<br> made fast there.<br><br> The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to<br> labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our<br> feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so<br> dark we couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward<br> end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in<br> front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down<br> through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we<br> seem to hear low voices in yonder!<br><br> Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come<br> along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just<br> then I heard a voice wail out and say:<br><br> ‘Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!’<br><br> Another voice said, pretty loud:<br><br> ‘It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way before. You always want<br> more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because<br> you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time you've said<br> it jest one time too many. You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in<br> this country.’<br><br> By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with<br> curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,<br> and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I<br> dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft<br> in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the<br> cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the<br> floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one<br> of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.<br> This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and<br> saying:<br><br> ‘I'd _like_ to! And I orter, too--a mean skunk!’<br><br> The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, ‘Oh, please don't, Bill;<br> I hain't ever goin' to tell.’<br><br> And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and<br> say:<br><br> ‘'Deed you _ain't!_ You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet<br> you.’ And once he said: ‘Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the<br> best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both. And what _for_? Jist<br> for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for. But<br> I lay you ain't a-goin' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put<br> _up_ that pistol, Bill.’<br><br> Bill says:<br><br> ‘I don't want to, Jake Packard. I'm for killin' him--and didn't he kill<br> old Hatfield jist the same way--and don't he deserve it?’<br><br> ‘But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.’<br><br> ‘Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you<br> long's I live!’ says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.<br><br> Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail<br> and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill<br> to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat<br> slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting<br> run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.<br> The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my<br> stateroom, he says:<br><br> ‘Here--come in here.’<br><br> And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up<br> in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there,<br> with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see<br> them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.<br> I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference<br> anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I<br> didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body _couldn't_<br> breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted<br> to kill Turner. He says:<br><br> ‘He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares<br> to him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way<br> we've served him. Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now<br> you hear _me_. I'm for putting him out of his troubles.’<br><br> ‘So'm I,’ says Packard, very quiet.<br><br> ‘Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all<br> right. Le's go and do it.’<br><br> ‘Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. You listen to me.<br> Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's _got_ to be<br> done. But what I say is this: it ain't good sense to go court'n around<br> after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's<br> jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. Ain't<br> that so?’<br><br> ‘You bet it is. But how you goin' to manage it this time?’<br><br> ‘Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever<br> pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide<br> the truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two<br> hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See?<br> He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own<br> self. I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.<br> I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it<br> ain't good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I reck'n you are. But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?’<br><br> ‘Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?’<br><br> ‘All right, then; come along.’<br><br> So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled<br> forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse<br> whisper, ‘Jim!’ and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a<br> moan, and I says:<br><br> ‘Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a<br> gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set<br> her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the<br> wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their<br> boat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.<br> Quick--hurry! I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You<br> start at the raft, and--’<br><br> ‘Oh, my lordy, lordy! _raf'_? Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done broke<br> loose en gone I--en here we is!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIII.<br><br> WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with<br> such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd<br> _got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went<br> a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,<br> too--seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim<br> said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't<br> hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left<br> on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck<br> for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along<br> forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the<br> edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the<br> cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely<br> see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been<br> aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his<br> head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;<br> but he jerked it in again, and says:<br><br> ‘Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!’<br><br> He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and<br> set down. It was Packard. Then Bill _he_ come out and got in. Packard<br> says, in a low voice:<br><br> ‘All ready--shove off!’<br><br> I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill<br> says:<br><br> ‘Hold on--'d you go through him?’<br><br> ‘No. Didn't you?’<br><br> ‘No. So he's got his share o' the cash yet.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.’<br><br> ‘Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?’<br><br> ‘Maybe he won't. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.’<br><br> So they got out and went in.<br><br> The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half<br> second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my<br> knife and cut the rope, and away we went!<br><br> We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even<br> breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the<br> paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a<br> hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every<br> last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.<br><br> When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern<br> show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed<br> by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to<br> understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.<br><br> Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the<br> first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't<br> had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for<br> murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain't no<br> telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would<br> I like it? So says I to Jim:<br><br> ‘The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above<br> it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and<br> then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for<br> that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when<br> their time comes.’<br><br> But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,<br> and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light<br> showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river,<br> watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the<br> rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,<br> and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we<br> made for it.<br><br> It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We<br> seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would<br> go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole<br> there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told<br> Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone<br> about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars<br> and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more<br> showed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore<br> light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it was a<br> lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I skimmed<br> around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and<br> by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between<br> his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to<br> cry.<br><br> He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only<br> me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:<br><br> ‘Hello, what's up? Don't cry, bub. What's the trouble?’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘Pap, and mam, and sis, and--’<br><br> Then I broke down. He says:<br><br> ‘Oh, dang it now, _don't_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,<br> and this 'n 'll come out all right. What's the matter with 'em?’<br><br> ‘They're--they're--are you the watchman of the boat?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. ‘I'm the captain<br> and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head<br> deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers. I ain't as<br> rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good<br> to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he<br> does; but I've told him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places with<br> him; for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if<br> _I'd_ live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin'<br> on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I--’<br><br> I broke in and says:<br><br> ‘They're in an awful peck of trouble, and--’<br><br> ‘_Who_ is?’<br><br> ‘Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take your<br> ferryboat and go up there--’<br><br> ‘Up where? Where are they?’<br><br> ‘On the wreck.’<br><br> ‘What wreck?’<br><br> ‘Why, there ain't but one.’<br><br> ‘What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Good land! what are they doin' _there_, for gracious sakes?’<br><br> ‘Well, they didn't go there a-purpose.’<br><br> ‘I bet they didn't! Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em<br> if they don't git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they<br> ever git into such a scrape?’<br><br> ‘Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--’<br><br> ‘Yes, Booth's Landing--go on.’<br><br> ‘She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of<br> the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry<br> to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I<br> disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung<br> around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and<br> saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and<br> the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard<br> the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our<br> trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was<br> right on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but<br> Bill Whipple--and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!--I most wish 't it had<br> been me, I do.’<br><br> ‘My George! It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. And _then_ what<br> did you all do?’<br><br> ‘Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't<br> make nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help<br> somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,<br> and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and<br> hunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the thing. I made the land about a mile<br> below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do<br> something, but they said, 'What, in such a night and such a current?<br> There ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.' Now if you'll go<br> and--’<br><br> ‘By Jackson, I'd _like_ to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but<br> who in the dingnation's a-going' to _pay_ for it? Do you reckon your<br> pap--’<br><br> ‘Why _that's_ all right. Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that<br> her uncle Hornback--’<br><br> ‘Great guns! is _he_ her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light<br> over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a<br> quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart you<br> out to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill. And don't you fool<br> around any, because he'll want to know the news. Tell him I'll have<br> his niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I'm<br> a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.’<br><br> I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back<br> and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in<br> the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among<br> some woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat<br> start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on<br> accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would<br> a done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she would be<br> proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and<br> dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest<br> in.<br><br> Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along<br> down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for<br> her. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance<br> for anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered<br> a little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still. I felt a little<br> bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they<br> could stand it I could.<br><br> Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river<br> on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach<br> I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the<br> wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know her<br> uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give<br> it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming<br> down the river.<br><br> It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and when<br> it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I<br> got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we<br> struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned<br> in and slept like dead people.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIV.<br><br> BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole<br> off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all<br> sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three<br> boxes of seegars. We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of<br> our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the<br> woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good<br> time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the<br> ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said<br> he didn't want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the<br> texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he<br> nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could<br> be fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he<br> did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get<br> the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he<br> was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a<br> nigger.<br><br> I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and<br> how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each<br> other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'stead<br> of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says:<br><br> ‘I didn' know dey was so many un um. I hain't hearn 'bout none un um,<br> skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in a<br> pack er k'yards. How much do a king git?’<br><br> ‘Get?’ I says; ‘why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want<br> it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to<br> them.’<br><br> ‘_Ain'_ dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?’<br><br> ‘_They_ don't do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around.’<br><br> ‘No; is dat so?’<br><br> ‘Of course it is. They just set around--except, maybe, when there's a<br> war; then they go to the war. But other times they just lazy around; or<br> go hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d' you hear a noise?’<br><br> We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a<br> steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ says I, ‘and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the<br> parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off.<br> But mostly they hang round the harem.’<br><br> ‘Roun' de which?’<br><br> ‘Harem.’<br><br> ‘What's de harem?’<br><br> ‘The place where he keeps his wives. Don't you know about the harem?<br> Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.’<br><br> ‘Why, yes, dat's so; I--I'd done forgot it. A harem's a bo'd'n-house, I<br> reck'n. Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck'n<br> de wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket. Yit dey say<br> Sollermun de wises' man dat ever live'. I doan' take no stock in<br> dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a<br> blim-blammin' all de time? No--'deed he wouldn't. A wise man 'ud take<br> en buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet _down_ de biler-factry<br> when he want to res'.’<br><br> ‘Well, but he _was_ the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told<br> me so, her own self.’<br><br> ‘I doan k'yer what de widder say, he _warn't_ no wise man nuther. He<br> had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see. Does you know 'bout dat<br> chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?’<br><br> ‘Yes, the widow told me all about it.’<br><br> ‘_Well_, den! Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'? You jes'<br> take en look at it a minute. Dah's de stump, dah--dat's one er de women;<br> heah's you--dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's<br> de chile. Bofe un you claims it. What does I do? Does I shin aroun'<br> mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill _do_ b'long to, en<br> han' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody dat<br> had any gumption would? No; I take en whack de bill in _two_, en give<br> half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat's de way<br> Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast you: what's<br> de use er dat half a bill?--can't buy noth'n wid it. En what use is a<br> half a chile? I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um.’<br><br> ‘But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point--blame it, you've missed<br> it a thousand mile.’<br><br> ‘Who? Me? Go 'long. Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints. I reck'n I<br> knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as<br> dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout a whole<br> chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile<br> wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain. Doan'<br> talk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.’<br><br> ‘But I tell you you don't get the point.’<br><br> ‘Blame de point! I reck'n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de _real_<br> pint is down furder--it's down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was<br> raised. You take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen; is dat man<br> gwyne to be waseful o' chillen? No, he ain't; he can't 'ford it. _He_<br> know how to value 'em. But you take a man dat's got 'bout five million<br> chillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt. _He_ as soon chop a<br> chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'. A chile er two, mo' er less,<br> warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!’<br><br> I never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there<br> warn't no getting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of<br> any nigger I ever see. So I went to talking about other kings, and let<br> Solomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off<br> in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that<br> would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say<br> he died there.<br><br> ‘Po' little chap.’<br><br> ‘But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.’<br><br> ‘Dat's good! But he'll be pooty lonesome--dey ain' no kings here, is<br> dey, Huck?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Den he cain't git no situation. What he gwyne to do?’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them<br> learns people how to talk French.’<br><br> ‘Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?’<br><br> ‘_No_, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said--not a single word.’<br><br> ‘Well, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat come?’<br><br> ‘I don't know; but it's so. I got some of their jabber out of a book.<br> S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy--what would you<br> think?’<br><br> ‘I wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de head--dat is, if he<br> warn't white. I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat.’<br><br> ‘Shucks, it ain't calling you anything. It's only saying, do you know<br> how to talk French?’<br><br> ‘Well, den, why couldn't he _say_ it?’<br><br> ‘Why, he _is_ a-saying it. That's a Frenchman's _way_ of saying it.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' 'bout<br> it. Dey ain' no sense in it.’<br><br> ‘Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?’<br><br> ‘No, a cat don't.’<br><br> ‘Well, does a cow?’<br><br> ‘No, a cow don't, nuther.’<br><br> ‘Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?’<br><br> ‘No, dey don't.’<br><br> ‘It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't<br> it?’<br><br> ‘Course.’<br><br> ‘And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different<br> from _us_?’<br><br> ‘Why, mos' sholy it is.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk<br> different from us? You answer me that.’<br><br> ‘Is a cat a man, Huck?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man. Is a cow a<br> man?--er is a cow a cat?’<br><br> ‘No, she ain't either of them.’<br><br> ‘Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one er the<br> yuther of 'em. Is a Frenchman a man?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘_Well_, den! Dad blame it, why doan' he _talk_ like a man? You answer<br> me _dat_!’<br><br> I see it warn't no use wasting words--you can't learn a nigger to argue.<br> So I quit.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XV.<br><br> WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom<br> of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was<br> after. We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the<br> Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.<br><br> Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead<br> to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled<br> ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anything<br> but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them<br> right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and<br> the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and<br> away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and<br> scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me--and<br> then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. I<br> jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle<br> and set her back a stroke. But she didn't come. I was in such a hurry<br> I hadn't untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so<br> excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.<br><br> As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right<br> down the towhead. That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead<br> warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot<br> out into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was<br> going than a dead man.<br><br> Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank<br> or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's<br> mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.<br> I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small<br> whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening<br> sharp to hear it again. The next time it come I see I warn't heading<br> for it, but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was<br> heading away to the left of it--and not gaining on it much either, for<br> I was flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going<br> straight ahead all the time.<br><br> I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the<br> time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops<br> that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly<br> I hears the whoop _behind_ me. I was tangled good now. That was<br> somebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around.<br><br> I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me<br> yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its<br> place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,<br> and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down-stream, and I<br> was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.<br> I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look<br> natural nor sound natural in a fog.<br><br> The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a<br> cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed<br> me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly<br> roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.<br><br> In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set<br> perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn't<br> draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.<br><br> I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank<br> was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it. It warn't no<br> towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber<br> of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than<br> half a mile wide.<br><br> I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I<br> was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don't<br> ever think of that. No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on<br> the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to<br> yourself how fast _you're_ going, but you catch your breath and think,<br> my! how that snag's tearing along. If you think it ain't dismal and<br> lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it<br> once--you'll see.<br><br> Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears<br> the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do<br> it, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had<br> little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me--sometimes just a narrow<br> channel between, and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because<br> I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash<br> that hung over the banks. Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down<br> amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,<br> anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern. You never<br> knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.<br><br> I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to<br> keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the<br> raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would<br> get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little<br> faster than what I was.<br><br> Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't<br> hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a<br> snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I<br> laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more. I didn't<br> want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it;<br> so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.<br><br> But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars<br> was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a<br> big bend stern first. First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was<br> dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come<br> up dim out of last week.<br><br> It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest<br> kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see<br> by the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the<br> water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a<br> couple of sawlogs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and<br> chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft.<br><br> When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his<br> knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. The<br> other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and<br> branches and dirt. So she'd had a rough time.<br><br> I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began to<br> gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:<br><br> ‘Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn't you stir me up?’<br><br> ‘Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain' dead--you ain'<br> drownded--you's back agin? It's too good for true, honey, it's too good<br> for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you. No, you ain'<br> dead! you's back agin, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck--de same ole<br> Huck, thanks to goodness!’<br><br> ‘What's the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?’<br><br> ‘Drinkin'? Has I ben a-drinkin'? Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin'?’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?’<br><br> ‘How does I talk wild?’<br><br> ‘_How_? Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and all that<br> stuff, as if I'd been gone away?’<br><br> ‘Huck--Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. _Hain't_ you<br> ben gone away?’<br><br> ‘Gone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain't been gone<br> anywheres. Where would I go to?’<br><br> ‘Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is. Is I _me_, or who<br> _is_ I? Is I heah, or whah _is_ I? Now dat's what I wants to know.’<br><br> ‘Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a<br> tangle-headed old fool, Jim.’<br><br> ‘I is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn't you tote out de line in<br> de canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?’<br><br> ‘No, I didn't. What tow-head? I hain't see no tow-head.’<br><br> ‘You hain't seen no towhead? Looky here, didn't de line pull loose en<br> de raf' go a-hummin' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in<br> de fog?’<br><br> ‘What fog?’<br><br> ‘Why, de fog!--de fog dat's been aroun' all night. En didn't you whoop,<br> en didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us got<br> los' en t'other one was jis' as good as los', 'kase he didn' know whah<br> he wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible<br> time en mos' git drownded? Now ain' dat so, boss--ain't it so? You<br> answer me dat.’<br><br> ‘Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain't seen no fog, nor no<br> islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking with<br> you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon<br> I done the same. You couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of course<br> you've been dreaming.’<br><br> ‘Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?’<br><br> ‘Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it<br> happen.’<br><br> ‘But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as--’<br><br> ‘It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it.<br> I know, because I've been here all the time.’<br><br> Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying<br> over it. Then he says:<br><br> ‘Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't<br> de powerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo'<br> dat's tired me like dis one.’<br><br> ‘Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like<br> everything sometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me all<br> about it, Jim.’<br><br> So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as<br> it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must<br> start in and ‘'terpret’ it, because it was sent for a warning. He said<br> the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but<br> the current was another man that would get us away from him. The whoops<br> was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn't<br> try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad<br> luck, 'stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of towheads was troubles<br> we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean<br> folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate<br> them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big<br> clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn't have no more<br> trouble.<br><br> It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it<br> was clearing up again now.<br><br> ‘Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,’ I<br> says; ‘but what does _these_ things stand for?’<br><br> It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. You<br> could see them first-rate now.<br><br> Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash<br> again. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he<br> couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place<br> again right away. But when he did get the thing straightened around he<br> looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:<br><br> ‘What do dey stan' for? I'se gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore<br> out wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz<br> mos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no' mo' what become<br> er me en de raf'. En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe<br> en soun', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo'<br> foot, I's so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could<br> make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash<br> is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em<br> ashamed.’<br><br> Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without<br> saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean<br> I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.<br><br> It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble<br> myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it<br> afterwards, neither. I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and I<br> wouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make him feel that way.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVI.<br><br> WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a<br> monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had<br> four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty<br> men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open<br> camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a<br> power of style about her. It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman<br> on such a craft as that.<br><br> We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got<br> hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on<br> both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We<br> talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to<br> it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but<br> about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit<br> up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two<br> big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe<br> we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the<br> same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the question<br> was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,<br> and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and<br> was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to<br> Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and<br> waited.<br><br> There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and<br> not pass it without seeing it. He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,<br> because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it<br> he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every<br> little while he jumps up and says:<br><br> ‘Dah she is?’<br><br> But it warn't. It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set<br> down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him<br> all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can<br> tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,<br> because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and<br> who was to blame for it? Why, _me_. I couldn't get that out of my<br> conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't<br> rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to<br> me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it<br> stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to<br> myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his<br> rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every<br> time, ‘But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a<br> paddled ashore and told somebody.’ That was so--I couldn't get around<br> that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, ‘What<br> had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off<br> right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor<br> old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to<br> learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to<br> be good to you every way she knowed how. _That's_ what she done.’<br><br> I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I<br> fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was<br> fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still.<br> Every time he danced around and says, ‘Dah's Cairo!’ it went through me<br> like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of<br> miserableness.<br><br> Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was<br> saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he<br> would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he<br> got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to<br> where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the<br> two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an<br> Ab'litionist to go and steal them.<br><br> It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk such<br> talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the<br> minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying,<br> ‘Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.’ Thinks I, this is what<br> comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good<br> as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would<br> steal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; a<br> man that hadn't ever done me no harm.<br><br> I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My<br> conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says<br> to it, ‘Let up on me--it ain't too late yet--I'll paddle ashore at the<br> first light and tell.’ I felt easy and happy and light as a feather<br> right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a<br> light, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one showed. Jim sings<br> out:<br><br> ‘We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de<br> good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know.’<br><br> He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom<br> for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:<br><br> ‘Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on<br> accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it<br> hadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck;<br> you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de _only_ fren' ole Jim's<br> got now.’<br><br> I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says<br> this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along<br> slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started<br> or whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:<br><br> ‘Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his<br> promise to ole Jim.’<br><br> Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I _got_ to do it--I can't get _out_<br> of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and<br> they stopped and I stopped. One of them says:<br><br> ‘What's that yonder?’<br><br> ‘A piece of a raft,’ I says.<br><br> ‘Do you belong on it?’<br><br> ‘Yes, sir.’<br><br> ‘Any men on it?’<br><br> ‘Only one, sir.’<br><br> ‘Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head<br> of the bend. Is your man white or black?’<br><br> I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. I<br> tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man<br> enough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just<br> give up trying, and up and says:<br><br> ‘He's white.’<br><br> ‘I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves.’<br><br> ‘I wish you would,’ says I, ‘because it's pap that's there, and maybe<br> you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He's sick--and so<br> is mam and Mary Ann.’<br><br> ‘Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. But I s'pose we've got to.<br> Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along.’<br><br> I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a<br> stroke or two, I says:<br><br> ‘Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes<br> away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it<br> by myself.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what's the matter<br> with your father?’<br><br> ‘It's the--a--the--well, it ain't anything much.’<br><br> They stopped pulling. It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft<br> now. One says:<br><br> ‘Boy, that's a lie. What _is_ the matter with your pap? Answer up<br> square now, and it'll be the better for you.’<br><br> ‘I will, sir, I will, honest--but don't leave us, please. It's<br> the--the--Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the<br> headline, you won't have to come a-near the raft--please do.’<br><br> ‘Set her back, John, set her back!’ says one. They backed water. ‘Keep<br> away, boy--keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has<br> blowed it to us. Your pap's got the small-pox, and you know it precious<br> well. Why didn't you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all<br> over?’<br><br> ‘Well,’ says I, a-blubbering, ‘I've told everybody before, and they just<br> went away and left us.’<br><br> ‘Poor devil, there's something in that. We are right down sorry for<br> you, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see. Look<br> here, I'll tell you what to do. Don't you try to land by yourself, or<br> you'll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty<br> miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It<br> will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them<br> your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don't be a fool again,<br> and let people guess what is the matter. Now we're trying to do you a<br> kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy.<br> It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only a<br> wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's<br> in pretty hard luck. Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this<br> board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave<br> you; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see?’<br><br> ‘Hold on, Parker,’ says the other man, ‘here's a twenty to put on the<br> board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll<br> be all right.’<br><br> ‘That's so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers<br> you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.’<br><br> ‘Good-bye, sir,’ says I; ‘I won't let no runaway niggers get by me if I<br> can help it.’<br><br> They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I<br> knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me<br> to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get _started_ right when<br> he's little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothing<br> to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I<br> thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right<br> and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? No, says<br> I, I'd feel bad--I'd feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says<br> I, what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do<br> right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?<br> I was stuck. I couldn't answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn't bother<br> no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at<br> the time.<br><br> I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I looked all around; he<br> warn't anywhere. I says:<br><br> ‘Jim!’<br><br> ‘Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o' sight yit? Don't talk loud.’<br><br> He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told<br> him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:<br><br> ‘I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne<br> to shove for sho' if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de<br> raf' agin when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck!<br> Dat _wuz_ de smartes' dodge! I tell you, chile, I'spec it save' ole<br> Jim--ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey.’<br><br> Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty<br> dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat<br> now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free<br> States. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he<br> wished we was already there.<br><br> Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding<br> the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and<br> getting all ready to quit rafting.<br><br> That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down<br> in a left-hand bend.<br><br> I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out<br> in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:<br><br> ‘Mister, is that town Cairo?’<br><br> ‘Cairo? no. You must be a blame' fool.’<br><br> ‘What town is it, mister?’<br><br> ‘If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin'<br> around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you<br> won't want.’<br><br> I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never<br> mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.<br><br> We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but<br> it was high ground, so I didn't go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim<br> said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable<br> close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did<br> Jim. I says:<br><br> ‘Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.’<br><br> He says:<br><br> ‘Doan' le's talk about it, Huck. Po' niggers can't have no luck. I<br> awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its work.’<br><br> ‘I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I'd never laid<br> eyes on it.’<br><br> ‘It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. Don't you blame yo'self<br> 'bout it.’<br><br> When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure<br> enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with<br> Cairo.<br><br> We talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't<br> take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait<br> for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept<br> all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,<br> and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!<br><br> We didn't say a word for a good while. There warn't anything to<br> say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the<br> rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only<br> look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more<br> bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep<br> still.<br><br> By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no<br> way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy<br> a canoe to go back in. We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't<br> anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after<br> us.<br><br> So we shoved out after dark on the raft.<br><br> Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a<br> snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it<br> now if they read on and see what more it done for us.<br><br> The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we<br> didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and<br> more. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next<br> meanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of the river, and you<br> can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along<br> comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she<br> would see it. Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they<br> go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but<br> nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.<br><br> We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she<br> was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see<br> how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off<br> a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks<br> he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to<br> try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She<br> was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black<br> cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged<br> out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining<br> like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right<br> over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the<br> engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went<br> overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight<br> through the raft.<br><br> I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel<br> had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could<br> always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a<br> minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was<br> nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of<br> my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and<br> of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she<br> stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was<br> churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I<br> could hear her.<br><br> I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;<br> so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was ‘treading water,’ and<br> struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see<br> that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which<br> meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.<br><br> It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good<br> long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the<br> bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over<br> rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a<br> big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to<br> rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling<br> and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVII.<br><br> IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his<br> head out, and says:<br><br> ‘Be done, boys! Who's there?’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘It's me.’<br><br> ‘Who's me?’<br><br> ‘George Jackson, sir.’<br><br> ‘What do you want?’<br><br> ‘I don't want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs<br> won't let me.’<br><br> ‘What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?’<br><br> ‘I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you<br> say your name was?’<br><br> ‘George Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy.’<br><br> ‘Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid--nobody'll<br> hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out<br> Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there<br> anybody with you?’<br><br> ‘No, sir, nobody.’<br><br> I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.<br> The man sung out:<br><br> ‘Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain't you got any sense?<br> Put it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are<br> ready, take your places.’<br><br> ‘All ready.’<br><br> ‘Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?’<br><br> ‘No, sir; I never heard of them.’<br><br> ‘Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward,<br> George Jackson. And mind, don't you hurry--come mighty slow. If there's<br> anybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he'll be shot.<br> Come along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to<br> squeeze in, d' you hear?’<br><br> I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I took one slow step at<br> a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.<br> The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind<br> me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and<br> unbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a<br> little and a little more till somebody said, ‘There, that's enough--put<br> your head in.’ I done it, but I judged they would take it off.<br><br> The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and<br> me at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns<br> pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray<br> and about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and<br> handsome--and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two<br> young women which I couldn't see right well. The old gentleman says:<br><br> ‘There; I reckon it's all right. Come in.’<br><br> As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it<br> and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and<br> they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,<br> and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front<br> windows--there warn't none on the side. They held the candle, and took a<br> good look at me, and all said, ‘Why, _he_ ain't a Shepherdson--no, there<br> ain't any Shepherdson about him.’ Then the old man said he hoped I<br> wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by<br> it--it was only to make sure. So he didn't pry into my pockets, but only<br> felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me to<br> make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old<br> lady says:<br><br> ‘Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't<br> you reckon it may be he's hungry?’<br><br> ‘True for you, Rachel--I forgot.’<br><br> So the old lady says:<br><br> ‘Betsy’ (this was a nigger woman), ‘you fly around and get him something<br> to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake<br> up Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself. Buck, take this little<br> stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some<br> of yours that's dry.’<br><br> Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there,<br> though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn't on anything but a<br> shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one<br> fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.<br> He says:<br><br> ‘Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?’<br><br> They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.<br><br> ‘Well,’ he says, ‘if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one.’<br><br> They all laughed, and Bob says:<br><br> ‘Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in<br> coming.’<br><br> ‘Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; I<br> don't get no show.’<br><br> ‘Never mind, Buck, my boy,’ says the old man, ‘you'll have show enough,<br> all in good time, don't you fret about that. Go 'long with you now, and<br> do as your mother told you.’<br><br> When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a<br> roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he<br> asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to<br> tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods<br> day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle<br> went out. I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.<br><br> ‘Well, guess,’ he says.<br><br> ‘How'm I going to guess,’ says I, ‘when I never heard tell of it<br> before?’<br><br> ‘But you can guess, can't you? It's just as easy.’<br><br> ‘_Which_ candle?’ I says.<br><br> ‘Why, any candle,’ he says.<br><br> ‘I don't know where he was,’ says I; ‘where was he?’<br><br> ‘Why, he was in the _dark_! That's where he was!’<br><br> ‘Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?’<br><br> ‘Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say, how long are you<br> going to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming<br> times--they don't have no school now. Do you own a dog? I've got a<br> dog--and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do<br> you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet<br> I don't, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon<br> I'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm. Are you all<br> ready? All right. Come along, old hoss.’<br><br> Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they<br> had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've<br> come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,<br> except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They<br> all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had<br> quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me<br> questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living<br> on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann<br> run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went<br> to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,<br> and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just<br> trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died<br> I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and<br> started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how<br> I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I<br> wanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I<br> went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,<br> I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to<br> think, and when Buck waked up I says:<br><br> ‘Can you spell, Buck?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ he says.<br><br> ‘I bet you can't spell my name,’ says I.<br><br> ‘I bet you what you dare I can,’ says he.<br><br> ‘All right,’ says I, ‘go ahead.’<br><br> ‘G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,’ he says.<br><br> ‘Well,’ says I, ‘you done it, but I didn't think you could. It ain't no<br> slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying.’<br><br> I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it<br> next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was<br> used to it.<br><br> It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn't<br> seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much<br> style. It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one<br> with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in<br> town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps<br> of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that<br> was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by<br> pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes<br> they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,<br> same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold<br> up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with<br> a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and<br> a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the<br> pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;<br> and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her<br> up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred<br> and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn't took any money for<br> her.<br><br> Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,<br> made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the<br> parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;<br> and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open<br> their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through<br> underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out<br> behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind<br> of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and<br> grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier<br> than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where<br> pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it<br> was, underneath.<br><br> This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and<br> blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It<br> come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books,<br> too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a<br> big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a<br> man that left his family, it didn't say why. I read considerable in it<br> now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was<br> Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't<br> read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.<br> Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body<br> was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And<br> there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged<br> down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.<br><br> They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,<br> and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called ‘Signing the<br> Declaration.’ There was some that they called crayons, which one of the<br> daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only<br> fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see<br> before--blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black<br> dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in<br> the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with<br> a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and<br> very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a<br> tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand<br> hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,<br> and underneath the picture it said ‘Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.’<br> Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight<br> to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a<br> chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird<br> laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath<br> the picture it said ‘I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.’<br> There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the<br> moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in<br> one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was<br> mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath<br> the picture it said ‘And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.’ These<br> was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take<br> to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the<br> fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot<br> more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done<br> what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was<br> having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they<br> said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and<br> every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it<br> done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman<br> in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump<br> off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with<br> the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her<br> breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up<br> towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,<br> and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died<br> before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the<br> head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung<br> flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young<br> woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so<br> many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.<br><br> This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste<br> obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the<br> Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.<br> It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name<br> of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:<br><br> ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D<br><br> And did young Stephen sicken, And did young Stephen die? And did the<br> sad hearts thicken, And did the mourners cry?<br><br> No; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad<br> hearts round him thickened, 'Twas not from sickness' shots.<br><br> No whooping-cough did rack his frame, Nor measles drear with spots;<br> Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots.<br><br> Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots, Nor<br> stomach troubles laid him low, Young Stephen Dowling Bots.<br><br> O no. Then list with tearful eye, Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul<br> did from this cold world fly By falling down a well.<br><br> They got him out and emptied him; Alas it was too late; His spirit<br> was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great.<br><br> If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was<br> fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by. Buck<br> said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever have to<br> stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't<br> find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down<br> another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write about<br> anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.<br> Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on<br> hand with her ‘tribute’ before he was cold. She called them tributes.<br> The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the<br> undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and<br> then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was<br> Whistler. She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained,<br> but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many's the<br> time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get<br> out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been<br> aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that<br> family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between<br> us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was<br> alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some<br> about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two<br> myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline's<br> room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she<br> liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.<br> The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty<br> of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there<br> mostly.<br><br> Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on<br> the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines<br> all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a little<br> old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever<br> so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing ‘The Last Link is Broken’<br> and play ‘The Battle of Prague’ on it. The walls of all the rooms was<br> plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was<br> whitewashed on the outside.<br><br> It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed<br> and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the<br> day, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn't be better.<br> And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVIII.<br><br> COL. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all<br> over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and<br> that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas<br> said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy<br> in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more<br> quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and<br> very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it<br> anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and<br> he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and<br> a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so<br> deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at<br> you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and<br> straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and<br> every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head<br> to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;<br> and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He<br> carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn't no<br> frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. He was<br> as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had<br> confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he<br> straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to<br> flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,<br> and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have to<br> tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered<br> where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine<br> most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned<br> into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was<br> enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.<br><br> When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got<br> up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again<br> till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where<br> the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and<br> he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and<br> then they bowed and said, ‘Our duty to you, sir, and madam;’ and _they_<br> bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,<br> all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and<br> the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and<br> give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.<br><br> Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad<br> shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They<br> dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and<br> wore broad Panama hats.<br><br> Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud<br> and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but<br> when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,<br> like her father. She was beautiful.<br><br> So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was<br> gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.<br><br> Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too. My nigger<br> had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do<br> anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.<br><br> This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be<br> more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.<br><br> The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.<br> Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or<br> fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings<br> round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods<br> daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly<br> kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a<br> handsome lot of quality, I tell you.<br><br> There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six<br> families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned<br> and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. The<br> Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was<br> about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a<br> lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their<br> fine horses.<br><br> One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse<br> coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:<br><br> ‘Quick! Jump for the woods!’<br><br> We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty<br> soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his<br> horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his<br> pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I<br> heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his<br> head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was<br> hid. But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run. The<br> woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,<br> and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away<br> the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see. We never<br> stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman's eyes blazed a<br> minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed<br> down, and he says, kind of gentle:<br><br> ‘I don't like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn't you step<br> into the road, my boy?’<br><br> ‘The Shepherdsons don't, father. They always take advantage.’<br><br> Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling<br> his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young<br> men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale,<br> but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.<br><br> Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by<br> ourselves, I says:<br><br> ‘Did you want to kill him, Buck?’<br><br> ‘Well, I bet I did.’<br><br> ‘What did he do to you?’<br><br> ‘Him? He never done nothing to me.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?’<br><br> ‘Why, nothing--only it's on account of the feud.’<br><br> ‘What's a feud?’<br><br> ‘Why, where was you raised? Don't you know what a feud is?’<br><br> ‘Never heard of it before--tell me about it.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ says Buck, ‘a feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with<br> another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;<br> then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the<br> _cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't<br> no more feud. But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.’<br><br> ‘Has this one been going on long, Buck?’<br><br> ‘Well, I should _reckon_! It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along<br> there. There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle<br> it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the<br> man that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody<br> would.’<br><br> ‘What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?’<br><br> ‘I reckon maybe--I don't know.’<br><br> ‘Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?’<br><br> ‘Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago.’<br><br> ‘Don't anybody know?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they<br> don't know now what the row was about in the first place.’<br><br> ‘Has there been many killed, Buck?’<br><br> ‘Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don't always kill. Pa's<br> got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh<br> much, anyway. Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been<br> hurt once or twice.’<br><br> ‘Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?’<br><br> ‘Yes; we got one and they got one. 'Bout three months ago my cousin<br> Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t'other side<br> of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'<br> foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind<br> him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun in<br> his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping<br> off and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they<br> had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all<br> the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced<br> around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old<br> man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn't git much chance to<br> enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.’<br><br> ‘I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.’<br><br> ‘I reckon he _warn't_ a coward. Not by a blame' sight. There ain't a<br> coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one. And there ain't no cowards<br> amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep' up his end in a<br> fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come<br> out winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got<br> behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the<br> bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around<br> the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.<br> Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the<br> Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of 'em was dead, and<br> another died the next day. No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards<br> he don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz<br> they don't breed any of that _kind_.’<br><br> Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody<br> a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept<br> them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The<br> Shepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching--all about<br> brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was<br> a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such<br> a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and<br> preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me<br> to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.<br><br> About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their<br> chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and<br> a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up<br> to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet<br> Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took<br> me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,<br> and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and<br> not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she'd forgot her<br> Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,<br> and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say<br> nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the<br> road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,<br> for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor<br> in summer-time because it's cool. If you notice, most folks don't go to<br> church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.<br><br> Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in<br> such a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and out drops a<br> little piece of paper with ‘HALF-PAST TWO’ wrote on it with a pencil. I<br> ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. I couldn't make anything<br> out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home<br> and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She<br> pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till<br> she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and<br> before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and<br> said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was<br> mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it<br> made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got<br> my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I<br> had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,<br> and I told her ‘no, only coarse-hand,’ and then she said the paper<br> warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and<br> play now.<br><br> I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon<br> I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out<br> of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes<br> a-running, and says:<br><br> ‘Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole<br> stack o' water-moccasins.’<br><br> Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter<br> know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for<br> them. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:<br><br> ‘All right; trot ahead.’<br><br> I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded<br> ankle deep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat piece<br> of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,<br> and he says:<br><br> ‘You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is.<br> I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'.’<br><br> Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid<br> him. I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch<br> as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying<br> there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!<br><br> I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to<br> him to see me again, but it warn't. He nearly cried he was so glad, but<br> he warn't surprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard<br> me yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody to<br> pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again. Says he:<br><br> ‘I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable ways<br> behine you towards de las'; when you landed I reck'ned I could ketch<br> up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dat<br> house I begin to go slow. I 'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to<br> you--I wuz 'fraid o' de dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed<br> you's in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early<br> in de mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey<br> tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on accounts<br> o' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how<br> you's a-gitt'n along.’<br><br> ‘Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?’<br><br> ‘Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn--but<br> we's all right now. I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a<br> chanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights when--’<br><br> ‘_What_ raft, Jim?’<br><br> ‘Our ole raf'.’<br><br> ‘You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?’<br><br> ‘No, she warn't. She was tore up a good deal--one en' of her was; but<br> dey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was mos' all los'. Ef we<br> hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn' ben<br> so dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin'<br> is, we'd a seed de raf'. But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now<br> she's all fixed up agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o'<br> stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'.’<br><br> ‘Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim--did you catch her?’<br><br> ‘How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de niggers<br> foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en dey hid her in a<br> crick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'um<br> she b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups<br> en settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, but<br> to you en me; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's<br> propaty, en git a hid'n for it? Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey<br> 'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en<br> make 'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever<br> I wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey. Dat Jack's<br> a good nigger, en pooty smart.’<br><br> ‘Yes, he is. He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come, and<br> he'd show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens _he_ ain't<br> mixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it 'll be the<br> truth.’<br><br> I don't want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I'll cut it<br> pretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and<br> go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was--didn't seem to be<br> anybody stirring. That warn't usual. Next I noticed that Buck was<br> up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs--nobody<br> around; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks<br> I, what does it mean? Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and<br> says:<br><br> ‘What's it all about?’<br><br> Says he:<br><br> ‘Don't you know, Mars Jawge?’<br><br> ‘No,’ says I, ‘I don't.’<br><br> ‘Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has. She run off in de<br> night some time--nobody don't know jis' when; run off to get married<br> to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know--leastways, so dey 'spec. De<br> fambly foun' it out 'bout half an hour ago--maybe a little mo'--en' I<br> _tell_ you dey warn't no time los'. Sich another hurryin' up guns<br> en hosses _you_ never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de<br> relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de<br> river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he kin<br> git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty<br> rough times.’<br><br> ‘Buck went off 'thout waking me up.’<br><br> ‘Well, I reck'n he _did_! Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it.<br> Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a<br> Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I reck'n, en you<br> bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.’<br><br> I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to<br> hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and<br> the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees<br> and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the<br> forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a<br> wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I<br> was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.<br><br> There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open<br> place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at<br> a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the<br> steamboat landing; but they couldn't come it. Every time one of them<br> showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The<br> two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch<br> both ways.<br><br> By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started<br> riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady<br> bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All<br> the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started<br> to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the<br> run. They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.<br> Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after<br> them. They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had<br> too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree,<br> and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.<br> One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about<br> nineteen years old.<br><br> The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was<br> out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn't know what<br> to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful<br> surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the<br> men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or<br> other--wouldn't be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I<br> dasn't come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and<br> his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this<br> day yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two<br> or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in<br> ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their<br> relations--the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what<br> was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they'd got across<br> the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take<br> on because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him--I<br> hain't ever heard anything like it.<br><br> All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns--the men had<br> slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their<br> horses! The boys jumped for the river--both of them hurt--and as they<br> swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and<br> singing out, ‘Kill them, kill them!’ It made me so sick I most fell out<br> of the tree. I ain't a-going to tell _all_ that happened--it would make<br> me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn't ever come ashore<br> that night to see such things. I ain't ever going to get shut of<br> them--lots of times I dream about them.<br><br> I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.<br> Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little<br> gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the<br> trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my<br> mind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I<br> was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss<br> Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and<br> I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way<br> she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess<br> wouldn't ever happened.<br><br> When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a<br> piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and<br> tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,<br> and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering<br> up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.<br><br> It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through<br> the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn't on his island, so I<br> tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,<br> red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was<br> gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn't get my breath for most<br> a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me<br> says:<br><br> ‘Good lan'! is dat you, honey? Doan' make no noise.’<br><br> It was Jim's voice--nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the<br> bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was<br> so glad to see me. He says:<br><br> ‘Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin. Jack's<br> been heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home no<br> mo'; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er<br> de crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack<br> comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead. Lawsy, I's mighty<br> glad to git you back again, honey.’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘All right--that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think<br> I've been killed, and floated down the river--there's something up there<br> that 'll help them think so--so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just<br> shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.’<br><br> I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in<br> the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and<br> judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn't had a bite to eat<br> since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,<br> and pork and cabbage and greens--there ain't nothing in the world so good<br> when it's cooked right--and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a<br> good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was<br> Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn't no home like a<br> raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a<br> raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIX.<br><br> TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,<br> they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put<br> in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile<br> and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as<br> night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always<br> in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and<br> willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next<br> we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool<br> off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee<br> deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres--perfectly<br> still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs<br> a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the<br> water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you<br> couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more<br> paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and<br> warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots<br> drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and<br> long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or<br> jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and<br> by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the<br> streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it<br> and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off<br> of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a<br> log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of<br> the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can<br> throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and<br> comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell<br> on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,<br> because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they<br> do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything<br> smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!<br><br> A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off<br> of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch<br> the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by<br> lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and<br> maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the<br> other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was<br> a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be<br> nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness. Next<br> you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it<br> chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the<br> axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go<br> up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the<br> _k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water. So we<br> would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once<br> there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating<br> tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them. A scow or a<br> raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and<br> laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made<br> you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.<br> Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:<br><br> ‘No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'‘<br><br> Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the<br> middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted<br> her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and<br> talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,<br> whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made<br> for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on<br> clothes, nohow.<br><br> Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest<br> time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe<br> a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water<br> you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe<br> you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.<br> It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled<br> with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and<br> discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he<br> allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would<br> have took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the moon could a _laid_<br> them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing<br> against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it<br> could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them<br> streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the<br> nest.<br><br> Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the<br> dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out<br> of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful<br> pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and<br> her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her<br> waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the<br> raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't<br> tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.<br><br> After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or<br> three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.<br> These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant<br> morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.<br><br> One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to<br> the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile<br> up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some<br> berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed<br> the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as<br> they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was<br> after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out<br> from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung<br> out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing<br> nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs<br> a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:<br><br> ‘Don't you do it. I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time<br> to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you<br> take to the water and wade down to me and get in--that'll throw the dogs<br> off the scent.’<br><br> They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,<br> and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,<br> shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't<br> see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got<br> further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at<br> all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the<br> river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid<br> in the cottonwoods and was safe.<br><br> One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head<br> and very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and<br> a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed<br> into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. He had<br> an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over<br> his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.<br><br> The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After<br> breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out<br> was that these chaps didn't know one another.<br><br> ‘What got you into trouble?’ says the baldhead to t'other chap.<br><br> ‘Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth--and<br> it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it--but I<br> stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act<br> of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and<br> you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off. So<br> I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_<br> you. That's the whole yarn--what's yourn?<br><br> ‘Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week,<br> and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin' it<br> mighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin' as much as five<br> or six dollars a night--ten cents a head, children and niggers free--and<br> business a-growin' all the time, when somehow or another a little report<br> got around last night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a<br> private jug on the sly. A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and told<br> me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and<br> they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start,<br> and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they'd tar<br> and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn't wait for no<br> breakfast--I warn't hungry.’<br><br> ‘Old man,’ said the young one, ‘I reckon we might double-team it<br> together; what do you think?’<br><br> ‘I ain't undisposed. What's your line--mainly?’<br><br> ‘Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;<br> theater-actor--tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology<br> when there's a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;<br> sling a lecture sometimes--oh, I do lots of things--most anything that<br> comes handy, so it ain't work. What's your lay?’<br><br> ‘I've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. Layin' on o'<br> hands is my best holt--for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I<br> k'n tell a fortune pretty good when I've got somebody along to find out<br> the facts for me. Preachin's my line, too, and workin' camp-meetin's,<br> and missionaryin' around.’<br><br> Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh<br> and says:<br><br> ‘Alas!’<br><br> ‘What 're you alassin' about?’ says the bald-head.<br><br> ‘To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded<br> down into such company.’ And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye<br> with a rag.<br><br> ‘Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?’ says the<br> baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.<br><br> ‘Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for who<br> fetched me so low when I was so high? I did myself. I don't blame<br> _you_, gentlemen--far from it; I don't blame anybody. I deserve it<br> all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know--there's a grave<br> somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done, and take<br> everything from me--loved ones, property, everything; but it can't take<br> that. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken<br> heart will be at rest.’ He went on a-wiping.<br><br> ‘Drot your pore broken heart,’ says the baldhead; ‘what are you heaving<br> your pore broken heart at _us_ f'r? _we_ hain't done nothing.’<br><br> ‘No, I know you haven't. I ain't blaming you, gentlemen. I brought<br> myself down--yes, I did it myself. It's right I should suffer--perfectly<br> right--I don't make any moan.’<br><br> ‘Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?’<br><br> ‘Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes--let it pass--'tis<br> no matter. The secret of my birth--’<br><br> ‘The secret of your birth! Do you mean to say--’<br><br> ‘Gentlemen,’ says the young man, very solemn, ‘I will reveal it to you,<br> for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!’<br><br> Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.<br> Then the baldhead says: ‘No! you can't mean it?’<br><br> ‘Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled<br> to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure<br> air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father<br> dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the<br> titles and estates--the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal<br> descendant of that infant--I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and<br> here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised<br> by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the<br> companionship of felons on a raft!’<br><br> Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but<br> he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we<br> was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most<br> anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we<br> ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say ‘Your Grace,’ or ‘My Lord,’<br> or ‘Your Lordship’--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain<br> ‘Bridgewater,’ which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and<br> one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for<br> him he wanted done.<br><br> Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood<br> around and waited on him, and says, ‘Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or<br> some o' dat?’ and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to<br> him.<br><br> But the old man got pretty silent by and by--didn't have much to say, and<br> didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on<br> around that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind. So, along<br> in the afternoon, he says:<br><br> ‘Looky here, Bilgewater,’ he says, ‘I'm nation sorry for you, but you<br> ain't the only person that's had troubles like that.’<br><br> ‘No?’<br><br> ‘No you ain't. You ain't the only person that's ben snaked down<br> wrongfully out'n a high place.’<br><br> ‘Alas!’<br><br> ‘No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth.’ And,<br> by jings, _he_ begins to cry.<br><br> ‘Hold! What do you mean?’<br><br> ‘Bilgewater, kin I trust you?’ says the old man, still sort of sobbing.<br><br> ‘To the bitter death!’ He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,<br> and says, ‘That secret of your being: speak!’<br><br> ‘Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!’<br><br> You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says:<br><br> ‘You are what?’<br><br> ‘Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment<br> on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the<br> Sixteen and Marry Antonette.’<br><br> ‘You! At your age! No! You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must<br> be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.’<br><br> ‘Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung<br> these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you<br> see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled,<br> trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.’<br><br> Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to<br> do, we was so sorry--and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.<br> So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort<br> _him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done<br> with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel<br> easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his<br> rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him<br> ‘Your Majesty,’ and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down<br> in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,<br> and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he<br> told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he<br> got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and<br> didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,<br> the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's<br> great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good<br> deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace<br> considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the<br> king says:<br><br> ‘Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer<br> raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour? It 'll only<br> make things oncomfortable. It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,<br> it ain't your fault you warn't born a king--so what's the use to worry?<br> Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says I--that's my motto.<br> This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here--plenty grub and an easy<br> life--come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be friends.’<br><br> The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took<br> away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because<br> it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the<br> raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody<br> to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.<br><br> It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no<br> kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I<br> never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;<br> then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble. If they<br> wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as<br> it would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so<br> I didn't tell him. If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt<br> that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them<br> have their own way.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XX.<br><br> THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we<br> covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of<br> running--was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I:<br><br> ‘Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?’<br><br> No, they allowed he wouldn't. I had to account for things some way, so<br> I says:<br><br> ‘My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and<br> they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he 'lowed<br> he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little<br> one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was<br> pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't<br> nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn't<br> enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.<br> Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched<br> this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.<br> Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of<br> the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;<br> Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four<br> years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next day or<br> two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in<br> skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was<br> a runaway nigger. We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't<br> bother us.’<br><br> The duke says:<br><br> ‘Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we<br> want to. I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.<br> We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go by<br> that town yonder in daylight--it mightn't be healthy.’<br><br> Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat<br> lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was<br> beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see<br> that. So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see<br> what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,<br> which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck<br> tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry<br> shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it<br> makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he would<br> take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't. He says:<br><br> ‘I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that<br> a corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace 'll<br> take the shuck bed yourself.’<br><br> Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was<br> going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when<br> the duke says:<br><br> ‘'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of<br> oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I<br> submit; 'tis my fate. I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear<br> it.’<br><br> We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand<br> well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we<br> got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of<br> lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half<br> a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below we<br> hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain<br> and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us<br> to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke<br> crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch<br> below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,<br> because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not<br> by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every<br> second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half<br> a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,<br> and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!<br> bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling<br> and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and<br> another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,<br> but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble<br> about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant<br> that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or<br> that and miss them.<br><br> I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,<br> so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always<br> mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king<br> and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for<br> me; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and<br> the waves warn't running so high now. About two they come up again,<br> though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because<br> he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was<br> mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a<br> regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing.<br> He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.<br><br> I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by<br> the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed<br> I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the<br> day.<br><br> The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him<br> and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got<br> tired of it, and allowed they would ‘lay out a campaign,’ as they called<br> it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of<br> little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said, ‘The<br> celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,’ would ‘lecture on the<br> Science of Phrenology’ at such and such a place, on the blank day of<br> blank, at ten cents admission, and ‘furnish charts of character at<br> twenty-five cents apiece.’ The duke said that was _him_. In another<br> bill he was the ‘world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the<br> Younger, of Drury Lane, London.’ In other bills he had a lot of other<br> names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with<br> a ‘divining-rod,’ ‘dissipating witch spells,’ and so on. By and by he<br> says:<br><br> ‘But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards,<br> Royalty?’<br><br> ‘No,’ says the king.<br><br> ‘You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur,’ says<br> the duke. ‘The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the<br> sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.<br> How does that strike you?’<br><br> ‘I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you<br> see, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen much<br> of it. I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace. Do you<br> reckon you can learn me?’<br><br> ‘Easy!’<br><br> ‘All right. I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway. Le's<br> commence right away.’<br><br> So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and<br> said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.<br><br> ‘But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white<br> whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.’<br><br> ‘No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.<br> Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the<br> difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight<br> before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled<br> nightcap. Here are the costumes for the parts.’<br><br> He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was<br> meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white<br> cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was<br> satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the<br> most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same<br> time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the<br> king and told him to get his part by heart.<br><br> There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and<br> after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run<br> in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would<br> go down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he would go,<br> too, and see if he couldn't strike something. We was out of coffee, so<br> Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.<br><br> When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and<br> perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning<br> himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or<br> too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the<br> woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that<br> camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.<br><br> The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it;<br> a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop--carpenters and<br> printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty,<br> littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of<br> horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed<br> his coat and said he was all right now. So me and the king lit out for<br> the camp-meeting.<br><br> We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most<br> awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from<br> twenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched<br> everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep<br> off the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with<br> branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of<br> watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.<br><br> The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was<br> bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside<br> slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into<br> for legs. They didn't have no backs. The preachers had high platforms<br> to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets;<br> and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the<br> young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and<br> some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen<br> shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks<br> was courting on the sly.<br><br> The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined<br> out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,<br> there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then<br> he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on. The people woke up<br> more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some<br> begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to<br> preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of<br> the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front<br> of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his<br> words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up<br> his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and<br> that, shouting, ‘It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon<br> it and live!’ And people would shout out, ‘Glory!--A-a-_men_!’ And so<br> he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:<br><br> ‘Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,<br> sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,<br> pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and<br> soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite<br> heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse<br> is free, the door of heaven stands open--oh, enter in and be at rest!’<br> (_A-A-Men_! _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)<br><br> And so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on<br> account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the<br> crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'<br> bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the<br> mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and<br> shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.<br><br> Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him<br> over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and<br> the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He<br> told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the<br> Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in<br> a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to<br> goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat<br> without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that<br> ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for<br> the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start<br> right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest<br> of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could<br> do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews<br> in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there<br> without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced<br> a pirate he would say to him, ‘Don't you thank me, don't you give me no<br> credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,<br> natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher<br> there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!’<br><br> And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody<br> sings out, ‘Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!’ Well,<br> a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, ‘Let _him_<br> pass the hat around!’ Then everybody said it, the preacher too.<br><br> So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,<br> and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being<br> so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the<br> prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would<br> up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he<br> always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or<br> six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to<br> live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said<br> as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and<br> besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to<br> work on the pirates.<br><br> When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had<br> collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had<br> fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a<br> wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said,<br> take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the<br> missionarying line. He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't<br> amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.<br><br> The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come<br> to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. He had set<br> up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that<br> printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. And he<br> had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he<br> said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so<br> they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took<br> in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them<br> paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as<br> usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the<br> price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.<br> He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of<br> his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,<br> ‘Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart’--and he left that all set<br> up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.<br> Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty<br> square day's work for it.<br><br> Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged<br> for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with<br> a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and ‘$200 reward’ under it. The<br> reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said<br> he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,<br> last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send<br> him back he could have the reward and expenses.<br><br> ‘Now,’ says the duke, ‘after to-night we can run in the daytime if we<br> want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot<br> with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we<br> captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,<br> so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down<br> to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,<br> but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much<br> like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,<br> as we say on the boards.’<br><br> We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble<br> about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night<br> to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in<br> the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could<br> boom right along if we wanted to.<br><br> We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten<br> o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't<br> hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.<br><br> When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:<br><br> ‘Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis<br> trip?’<br><br> ‘No,’ I says, ‘I reckon not.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ says he, ‘dat's all right, den. I doan' mine one er two kings,<br> but dat's enough. Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain' much<br> better.’<br><br> I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear<br> what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and<br> had so much trouble, he'd forgot it.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXI.<br><br> IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up. The<br> king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after<br> they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good<br> deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,<br> and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs<br> dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went<br> to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. When he had got it pretty<br> good him and the duke begun to practice it together. The duke had to<br> learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him<br> sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done<br> it pretty well; ‘only,’ he says, ‘you mustn't bellow out _Romeo_!<br> that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,<br> so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of<br> a girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass.’<br><br> Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out<br> of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called<br> himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around<br> the raft was grand to see. But by and by the king tripped and fell<br> overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all<br> kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river.<br><br> After dinner the duke says:<br><br> ‘Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so<br> I guess we'll add a little more to it. We want a little something to<br> answer encores with, anyway.’<br><br> ‘What's onkores, Bilgewater?’<br><br> The duke told him, and then says:<br><br> ‘I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe; and<br> you--well, let me see--oh, I've got it--you can do Hamlet's soliloquy.’<br><br> ‘Hamlet's which?’<br><br> ‘Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.<br> Ah, it's sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven't got<br> it in the book--I've only got one volume--but I reckon I can piece it out<br> from memory. I'll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call<br> it back from recollection's vaults.’<br><br> So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible<br> every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would<br> squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next<br> he would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear. It was beautiful<br> to see him. By and by he got it. He told us to give attention. Then<br> he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his<br> arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;<br> and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that,<br> all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his<br> chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.<br> This is the speech--I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it<br> to the king:<br><br> To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of<br> so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come<br> to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the<br> innocent sleep, Great nature's second course, And makes us rather sling<br> the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.<br> There's the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I<br> would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The<br> oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The law's delay, and the<br> quietus which his pangs might take. In the dead waste and middle of the<br> night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But<br> that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,<br> Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of<br> resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage, Is sicklied o'er with care.<br> And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops, With this<br> regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. 'Tis a<br> consummation devoutly to be wished. But soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope<br> not thy ponderous and marble jaws. But get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!<br><br> Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he<br> could do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when<br> he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he<br> would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.<br><br> The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and<br> after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a<br> most uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fighting<br> and rehearsing--as the duke called it--going on all the time. One morning,<br> when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight<br> of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about<br> three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was<br> shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took<br> the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that<br> place for our show.<br><br> We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that<br> afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in<br> all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave<br> before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he<br> hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills.

The stores and houses was most all<br> old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they<br> was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of<br> reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little<br> gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in<br> them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up<br> boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out<br> tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on<br> at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that<br> didn't generly have but one hinge--a leather one. Some of the fences<br> had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in<br> Clumbus's time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and<br> people driving them out.<br><br> All the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in<br> front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.<br> There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting<br> on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and<br> chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching--a mighty ornery<br> lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,<br> but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,<br> and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and<br> used considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer<br> leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands<br> in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw<br> of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the<br> time was:<br><br> ‘Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank.’<br><br> ‘Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.’<br><br> Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't got<br> none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a<br> chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing;<br> they say to a fellow, ‘I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this<br> minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had’--which is a lie pretty<br> much everytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no<br> stranger, so he says:<br><br> ‘_You_ give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister's cat's<br> grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me,<br> Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't charge<br> you no back intrust, nuther.’<br><br> ‘Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.’<br><br> ‘Yes, you did--'bout six chaws. You borry'd store tobacker and paid back<br> nigger-head.’<br><br> Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the<br> natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it<br> off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with<br> their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in<br> two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it<br> when it's handed back, and says, sarcastic:<br><br> ‘Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.’<br><br> All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else _but_<br> mud--mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,<br> and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places. The hogs loafed and<br> grunted around everywheres. You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs<br> come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way,<br> where folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her<br> eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as<br> happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer<br> sing out, ‘Hi! _so_ boy! sick him, Tige!’ and away the sow would go,<br> squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and<br> three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the<br> loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun<br> and look grateful for the noise. Then they'd settle back again till<br> there was a dog fight. There couldn't anything wake them up all over,<br> and make them happy all over, like a dog fight--unless it might be<br> putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a<br> tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.<br><br> On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,<br> and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people<br> had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some<br> others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but<br> it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house<br> caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep<br> will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the<br> river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,<br> and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.<br><br> The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the<br> wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.<br> Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them<br> in the wagons. There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I<br> seen three fights. By and by somebody sings out:<br><br> ‘Here comes old Boggs!--in from the country for his little old monthly<br> drunk; here he comes, boys!’<br><br> All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out<br> of Boggs. One of them says:<br><br> ‘Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time. If he'd a-chawed up all<br> the men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have<br> considerable ruputation now.’<br><br> Another one says, ‘I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know<br> I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year.’<br><br> Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an<br> Injun, and singing out:<br><br> ‘Cler the track, thar. I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is<br> a-gwyne to raise.’<br><br> He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year<br> old, and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him and laughed at<br> him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and<br> lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because<br> he'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, ‘Meat<br> first, and spoon vittles to top off on.’<br><br> He see me, and rode up and says:<br><br> ‘Whar'd you come f'm, boy? You prepared to die?’<br><br> Then he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:<br><br> ‘He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when he's<br> drunk. He's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw--never hurt nobody,<br> drunk nor sober.’<br><br> Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down<br> so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:<br><br> ‘Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.<br> You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!’<br><br> And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue<br> to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and<br> going on. By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five--and he was a<br> heap the best dressed man in that town, too--steps out of the store, and<br> the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He says to Boggs,<br> mighty ca'm and slow--he says:<br><br> ‘I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock. Till one<br> o'clock, mind--no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once<br> after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.’<br><br> Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody<br> stirred, and there warn't no more laughing. Boggs rode off<br> blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;<br> and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping<br> it up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,<br> but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen<br> minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away. But it didn't<br> do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down<br> in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down<br> the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get<br> a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they<br> could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street<br> he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. By and by<br> somebody says:<br><br> ‘Go for his daughter!--quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll listen<br> to her. If anybody can persuade him, she can.’<br><br> So somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and stopped.<br> In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his<br> horse. He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with<br> a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.<br> He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was<br> doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody sings out:<br><br> ‘Boggs!’<br><br> I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel<br> Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a<br> pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with<br> the barrel tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a young<br> girl coming on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men turned<br> round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men<br> jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to<br> a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,<br> ‘O Lord, don't shoot!’ Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,<br> clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards<br> on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. That young<br> girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her<br> father, crying, and saying, ‘Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!’ The<br> crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with<br> their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to<br> shove them back and shouting, ‘Back, back! give him air, give him air!’<br><br> Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned<br> around on his heels and walked off.<br><br> They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just<br> the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good<br> place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They<br> laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened<br> another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt<br> first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. He made about a<br> dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his<br> breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that<br> he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter away from<br> him, screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about sixteen, and<br> very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.<br><br> Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and<br> pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people<br> that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was<br> saying all the time, ‘Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows;<br> 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and<br> never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as<br> you.’<br><br> There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe<br> there was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was<br> excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,<br> and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,<br> stretching their necks and listening. One long, lanky man, with long<br> hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a<br> crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs<br> stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from<br> one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their<br> heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their<br> hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with<br> his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had<br> stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung<br> out, ‘Boggs!’ and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says<br> ‘Bang!’ staggered backwards, says ‘Bang!’ again, and fell down flat on<br> his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;<br> said it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much as a<br> dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.<br><br> Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a<br> minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and<br> snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXII.<br><br> THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging like<br> Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped<br> to mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the<br> mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along<br> the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every<br> tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the<br> mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of<br> reach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared<br> most to death.<br><br> They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could<br> jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise. It<br> was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out ‘Tear down the fence! tear<br> down the fence!’ Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and<br> smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to<br> roll in like a wave.<br><br> Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,<br> with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly<br> ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the<br> wave sucked back.<br><br> Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down. The<br> stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eye slow<br> along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to<br> out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked<br> sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant<br> kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread<br> that's got sand in it.<br><br> Then he says, slow and scornful:<br><br> ‘The idea of _you_ lynching anybody! It's amusing. The idea of you<br> thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_! Because you're brave<br> enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along<br> here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a<br> _man_? Why, a _man's_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as<br> long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.<br><br> ‘Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the<br> South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around.<br> The average man's a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him<br> that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.<br> In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men<br> in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a<br> brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other<br> people--whereas you're just _as_ brave, and no braver. Why don't your<br> juries hang murderers? Because they're afraid the man's friends will<br> shoot them in the back, in the dark--and it's just what they _would_ do.<br><br> ‘So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a<br> hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your mistake<br> is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the<br> other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks. You<br> brought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn't had him<br> to start you, you'd a taken it out in blowing.<br><br> ‘You didn't want to come. The average man don't like trouble and<br> danger. _You_ don't like trouble and danger. But if only _half_ a<br> man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!' you're<br> afraid to back down--afraid you'll be found out to be what you<br> are--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that<br> half-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big<br> things you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's<br> what an army is--a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in<br> them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their<br> officers. But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_<br> pitifulness. Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and<br> go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching's going to be done it<br> will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll<br> bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along. Now _leave_--and take your<br> half-a-man with you’--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking<br> it when he says this.<br><br> The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing<br> off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking<br> tolerable cheap. I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.<br><br> I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman<br> went by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold<br> piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because<br> there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from<br> home and amongst strangers that way. You can't be too careful. I ain't<br> opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but<br> there ain't no use in _wasting_ it on them.<br><br> It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was<br> when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side<br> by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes<br> nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and<br> comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a<br> lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang<br> of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of<br> dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight;<br> I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up<br> and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and<br> graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their<br> heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and<br> every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,<br> and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.<br><br> And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one<br> foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and<br> more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking<br> his whip and shouting ‘Hi!--hi!’ and the clown cracking jokes behind<br> him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her<br> knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how<br> the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the<br> other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I<br> ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and<br> went just about wild.<br><br> Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and<br> all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The<br> ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick<br> as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever<br> _could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I<br> couldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year.<br> And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to<br> ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued<br> and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show<br> come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make<br> fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that<br> stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the<br> benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, ‘Knock him down! throw him<br> out!’ and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster<br> he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no<br> disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more<br> trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.<br> So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute<br> he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,<br> with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the<br> drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every<br> jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing<br> till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men<br> could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,<br> round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging<br> to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,<br> and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It<br> warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.<br> But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,<br> a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and<br> dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire<br> too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable<br> as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his<br> clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up<br> the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he<br> was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you<br> ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly<br> hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to<br> the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and<br> astonishment.<br><br> Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the<br> sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own<br> men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on<br> to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't<br> a been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars. I don't<br> know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I<br> never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and<br> wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.<br><br> Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn't only about twelve<br> people there--just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the<br> time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before<br> the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these<br> Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted<br> was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he<br> reckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got<br> some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off<br> some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. The bills said:<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIII.<br><br> WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and<br> a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house<br> was jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn't hold no more,<br> the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on<br> to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,<br> and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one<br> that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about<br> Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;<br> and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he<br> rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing<br> out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,<br> ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a<br> rainbow. And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,<br> but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and<br> when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they<br> roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done<br> it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it<br> would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.<br><br> Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says<br> the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of<br> pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it<br> in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has<br> succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply<br> obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come<br> and see it.<br><br> Twenty people sings out:<br><br> ‘What, is it over? Is that _all_?’<br><br> The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings<br> out, ‘Sold!’ and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them<br> tragedians. But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:<br><br> ‘Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen.’ They stopped to listen. ‘We are<br> sold--mighty badly sold. But we don't want to be the laughing stock of<br> this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long<br> as we live. _No_. What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk<br> this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town! Then we'll all be in the<br> same boat. Ain't that sensible?’ (‘You bet it is!--the jedge is right!’<br> everybody sings out.) ‘All right, then--not a word about any sell. Go<br> along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.’<br><br> Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid<br> that show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this<br> crowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the<br> raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim<br> and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and<br> fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.<br><br> The third night the house was crammed again--and they warn't new-comers<br> this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. I<br> stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had<br> his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat--and I see it<br> warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs<br> by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the<br> signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four<br> of them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various<br> for me; I couldn't stand it. Well, when the place couldn't hold no more<br> people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door<br> for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after<br> him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:<br><br> ‘Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the<br> raft like the dickens was after you!’<br><br> I done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same time,<br> and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and<br> still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a<br> word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the<br> audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under<br> the wigwam, and says:<br><br> ‘Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?’ He hadn't been<br> up-town at all.<br><br> We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.<br> Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly<br> laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people. The<br> duke says:<br><br> ‘Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum and let<br> the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the<br> third night, and consider it was _their_ turn now. Well, it _is_ their<br> turn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it. I<br> _would_ just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity.<br> They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty<br> provisions.’<br><br> Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that<br> three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that<br> before. By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:<br><br> ‘Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?’<br><br> ‘No,’ I says, ‘it don't.’<br><br> ‘Why don't it, Huck?’<br><br> ‘Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. I reckon they're all<br> alike.’<br><br> ‘But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what<br> dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as<br> fur as I can make out.’<br><br> ‘Is dat so?’<br><br> ‘You read about them once--you'll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this 'n<br> 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_. And look at Charles Second,<br> and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward<br> Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon<br> heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My,<br> you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He _was_ a<br> blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head<br> next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was<br> ordering up eggs. 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says. They fetch her up.<br> Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off. 'Fetch up<br> Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her<br> head'--and they chop it off. 'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun<br> answers the bell. Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he made every<br> one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had<br> hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a<br> book, and called it Domesday Book--which was a good name and stated the<br> case. You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip<br> of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he<br> takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How<br> does he go at it--give notice?--give the country a show? No. All of a<br> sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks<br> out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was<br> _his_ style--he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his<br> father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show<br> up? No--drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S'pose people<br> left money laying around where he was--what did he do? He collared it.<br> S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set<br> down there and see that he done it--what did he do? He always done the<br> other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth--what then? If he didn't shut it<br> up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug<br> Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled<br> that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that ourn is lambs,<br> because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they<br> ain't nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings,<br> and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty<br> ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.’<br><br> ‘But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.’<br><br> ‘Well, they all do, Jim. We can't help the way a king smells; history<br> don't tell no way.’<br><br> ‘Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways.’<br><br> ‘Yes, a duke's different. But not very different. This one's<br> a middling hard lot for a duke. When he's drunk there ain't no<br> near-sighted man could tell him from a king.’<br><br> ‘Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck. Dese is all I<br> kin stan'.’<br><br> ‘It's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've got them on our hands, and we<br> got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we<br> could hear of a country that's out of kings.’<br><br> What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes? It<br> wouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: you<br> couldn't tell them from the real kind.<br><br> I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. He often<br> done that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with<br> his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I<br> didn't take notice nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was<br> thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low<br> and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his<br> life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white<br> folks does for their'n. It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.<br> He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I<br> was asleep, and saying, ‘Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's<br> mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!’ He<br> was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.<br><br> But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young<br> ones; and by and by he says:<br><br> ‘What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder<br> on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time<br> I treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery. She warn't on'y 'bout fo' year<br> ole, en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but<br> she got well, en one day she was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I<br> says:<br><br> ‘'Shet de do'.'<br><br> ‘She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me. It make me<br> mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:<br><br> ‘'Doan' you hear me? Shet de do'!'<br><br> ‘She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up. I was a-bilin'! I says:<br><br> ‘'I lay I _make_ you mine!'<br><br> ‘En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin'.<br> Den I went into de yuther room, en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes; en when<br> I come back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open _yit_, en dat chile stannin'<br> mos' right in it, a-lookin' down and mournin', en de tears runnin' down.<br> My, but I _wuz_ mad! I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den--it was a<br> do' dat open innerds--jis' den, 'long come de wind en slam it to, behine<br> de chile, ker-BLAM!--en my lan', de chile never move'! My breff mos'<br> hop outer me; en I feel so--so--I doan' know HOW I feel. I crope out,<br> all a-tremblin', en crope aroun' en open de do' easy en slow, en poke my<br> head in behine de chile, sof' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW!<br> jis' as loud as I could yell. _She never budge!_ Oh, Huck, I bust out<br> a-cryin' en grab her up in my arms, en say, 'Oh, de po' little thing!<br> De Lord God Amighty fogive po' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive<br> hisself as long's he live!' Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb<br> deef en dumb--en I'd ben a-treat'n her so!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIV.<br><br> NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in<br> the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the<br> duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim<br> he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few<br> hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to<br> lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him<br> all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all<br> by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway<br> nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay<br> roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.<br><br> He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed<br> Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a<br> white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint<br> and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,<br> dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days. Blamed if<br> he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took<br> and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:<br><br> Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.<br><br> And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five<br> foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight<br> better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all<br> over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself<br> free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop<br> out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like<br> a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.<br> Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he<br> wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was<br> dead, he looked considerable more than that.<br><br> These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was<br> so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe<br> the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no<br> project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd<br> lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up<br> something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop<br> over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence<br> to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all<br> bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n<br> on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king's<br> duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never<br> knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked<br> like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off<br> his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand<br> and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,<br> and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I<br> got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away<br> up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple<br> of hours, taking on freight. Says the king:<br><br> ‘Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.<br> Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat,<br> Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her.’<br><br> I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.<br> I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went<br> scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to<br> a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the<br> sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a<br> couple of big carpet-bags by him.<br><br> ‘Run her nose in shore,’ says the king. I done it. ‘Wher' you bound<br> for, young man?’<br><br> ‘For the steamboat; going to Orleans.’<br><br> ‘Git aboard,’ says the king. ‘Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p you<br> with them bags. Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus’--meaning me,<br> I see.<br><br> I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was<br> mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.<br> He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come<br> down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he<br> was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The<br> young fellow says:<br><br> ‘When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he<br> come mighty near getting here in time.' But then I says again, 'No, I<br> reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You<br> _ain't_ him, are you?’<br><br> ‘No, my name's Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander<br> Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.<br> But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving<br> in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it--which I hope he<br> hasn't.’<br><br> ‘Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all<br> right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn't<br> mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything<br> in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing<br> else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys<br> together--and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all--that's the deef<br> and dumb one--William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and<br> George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married<br> brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William's the<br> only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here<br> in time.’<br><br> ‘Did anybody send 'em word?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter<br> said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this<br> time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to<br> be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he<br> was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem<br> to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and<br> William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can't<br> bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd<br> told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the<br> property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right--for George<br> didn't leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put<br> a pen to.’<br><br> ‘Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher' does he live?’<br><br> ‘Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn't ever been in<br> this country. He hasn't had any too much time--and besides he mightn't a<br> got the letter at all, you know.’<br><br> ‘Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.<br> You going to Orleans, you say?’<br><br> ‘Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm going in a ship, next<br> Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.’<br><br> ‘It's a pretty long journey. But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.<br> Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?’<br><br> ‘Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about<br> fourteen--that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a<br> hare-lip.’<br><br> ‘Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.’<br><br> ‘Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they<br> ain't going to let them come to no harm. There's Hobson, the Babtis'<br> preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,<br> and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the<br> widow Bartley, and--well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones<br> that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when<br> he wrote home; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets<br> here.’<br><br> Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied<br> that young fellow. Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and<br> everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about<br> Peter's business--which was a tanner; and about George's--which was a<br> carpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and so<br> on, and so on. Then he says:<br><br> ‘What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?’<br><br> ‘Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop<br> there. When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat<br> will, but this is a St. Louis one.’<br><br> ‘Was Peter Wilks well off?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he<br> left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers.’<br><br> ‘When did you say he died?’<br><br> ‘I didn't say, but it was last night.’<br><br> ‘Funeral to-morrow, likely?’<br><br> ‘Yes, 'bout the middle of the day.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or<br> another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right.’<br><br> ‘Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that.’<br><br> When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she<br> got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost<br> my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up<br> another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:<br><br> ‘Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new<br> carpet-bags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and<br> git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.’<br><br> I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When<br> I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a<br> log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had<br> said it--every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he<br> tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for<br> a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he<br> really done it pretty good. Then he says:<br><br> ‘How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?’<br><br> The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef<br> and dumb person on the histronic boards. So then they waited for a<br> steamboat.<br><br> About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,<br> but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there<br> was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went<br> aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted<br> to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and<br> said they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He says:<br><br> ‘If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and<br> put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?’<br><br> So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the<br> village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when<br> they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:<br><br> ‘Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?’ they<br> give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,<br> ‘What d' I tell you?’ Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:<br><br> ‘I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_<br> live yesterday evening.’<br><br> Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up<br> against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his<br> back, and says:<br><br> ‘Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,<br> it's too, too hard!’<br><br> Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to<br> the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and<br> bust out a-crying. If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds,<br> that ever I struck.<br><br> Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all<br> sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill<br> for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about<br> his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on<br> his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner<br> like they'd lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anything<br> like it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human<br> race.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXV.<br><br> THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people<br> tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on<br> their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,<br> and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The windows and<br> dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:<br><br> ‘Is it _them_?’<br><br> And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:<br><br> ‘You bet it is.’<br><br> When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the<br> three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but<br> that don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her<br> face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles<br> was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for<br> them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!<br> Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again<br> at last and have such good times.<br><br> Then the king he hunched the duke private--I see him do it--and then he<br> looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so<br> then him and the duke, with a hand across each other's shoulder, and<br> t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody<br> dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,<br> people saying ‘Sh!’ and all the men taking their hats off and drooping<br> their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. And when they got there<br> they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then<br> they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and<br> then they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their chins<br> over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,<br> I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody<br> was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything<br> like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t'other on<br> t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the<br> coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. Well, when it come<br> to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and<br> everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud--the poor girls,<br> too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a<br> word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand<br> on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running<br> down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give<br> the next woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.<br><br> Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and<br> works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and<br> flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother<br> to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long<br> journey of four thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and<br> sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he<br> thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart, because out<br> of their mouths they can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that<br> kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers<br> out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying<br> fit to bust.<br><br> And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the<br> crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their<br> might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church<br> letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and<br> hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and<br> bully.<br><br> Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his<br> nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the<br> family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up<br> with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying<br> yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that<br> was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will<br> name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:--Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon<br> Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and<br> Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.<br><br> Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting<br> together--that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other<br> world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up<br> to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so they all<br> come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;<br> and then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing, but just<br> kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst<br> he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said ‘Goo-goo--goo-goo-goo’<br> all the time, like a baby that can't talk.<br><br> So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty<br> much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts<br> of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to<br> George's family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him<br> the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of<br> that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.<br><br> Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the<br> king he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house<br> and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard<br> (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and<br> land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold<br> to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down<br> cellar. So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have<br> everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.<br> We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag<br> they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them<br> yaller-boys. My, the way the king's eyes did shine! He slaps the duke<br> on the shoulder and says:<br><br> ‘Oh, _this_ ain't bully nor noth'n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why,<br> _bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don't_ it?’<br><br> The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them<br> through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the<br> king says:<br><br> ‘It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and<br> representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and<br> me, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence. It's the best<br> way, in the long run. I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't no better<br> way.’<br><br> Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on<br> trust; but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out<br> four hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:<br><br> ‘Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen<br> dollars?’<br><br> They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then<br> the duke says:<br><br> ‘Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake--I reckon<br> that's the way of it. The best way's to let it go, and keep still about<br> it. We can spare it.’<br><br> ‘Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it. I don't k'yer noth'n 'bout<br> that--it's the _count_ I'm thinkin' about. We want to be awful square<br> and open and above-board here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer<br> money up stairs and count it before everybody--then ther' ain't noth'n<br> suspicious. But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you<br> know, we don't want to--’<br><br> ‘Hold on,’ says the duke. ‘Le's make up the deffisit,’ and he begun to<br> haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.<br><br> ‘It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke--you _have_ got a rattlin' clever<br> head on you,’ says the king. ‘Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin'<br> us out agin,’ and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them<br> up.<br><br> It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.<br><br> ‘Say,’ says the duke, ‘I got another idea. Le's go up stairs and count<br> this money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.’<br><br> ‘Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a<br> man struck. You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I ever see.<br> Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it. Let 'em<br> fetch along their suspicions now if they want to--this 'll lay 'em out.’<br><br> When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king<br> he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile--twenty<br> elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their<br> chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin<br> to swell himself up for another speech. He says:<br><br> ‘Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by<br> them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by<br> these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left<br> fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he<br> would a done _more_ generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin'<br> his dear William and me. Now, _wouldn't_ he? Ther' ain't no question<br> 'bout it in _my_ mind. Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be<br> that 'd stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o' uncles would<br> it be that 'd rob--yes, _rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved<br> so at sech a time? If I know William--and I _think_ I do--he--well, I'll<br> jest ask him.’ He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to<br> the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and<br> leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his<br> meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,<br> and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king says,<br> ‘I knowed it; I reckon _that 'll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels<br> about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money--take it<br> _all_. It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.’<br><br> Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the<br> duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And<br> everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the<br> hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:<br><br> ‘You _dear_ good souls!--how _lovely_!--how _could_ you!’<br><br> Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased<br> again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and<br> before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,<br> and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody<br> saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was<br> all busy listening. The king was saying--in the middle of something he'd<br> started in on--<br><br> ‘--they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased. That's why they're<br> invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come--everybody;<br> for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten that<br> his funeral orgies sh'd be public.’<br><br> And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and<br> every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke<br> he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,<br> ‘_Obsequies_, you old fool,’ and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and<br> reaching it over people's heads to him. The king he reads it and puts<br> it in his pocket, and says:<br><br> ‘Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart's_ aluz right. Asks me<br> to invite everybody to come to the funeral--wants me to make 'em all<br> welcome. But he needn't a worried--it was jest what I was at.’<br><br> Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his<br> funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And<br> when he done it the third time he says:<br><br> ‘I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it<br> ain't--obsequies bein' the common term--but because orgies is the right<br> term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now--it's gone out. We<br> say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing<br> you're after more exact. It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek<br> _orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover<br> up; hence in_ter._ So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public<br> funeral.’<br><br> He was the _worst_ I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed<br> right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, ‘Why,<br> _doctor_!’ and Abner Shackleford says:<br><br> ‘Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.’<br><br> The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:<br><br> ‘Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician? I--’<br><br> ‘Keep your hands off of me!’ says the doctor. ‘_You_ talk like an<br> Englishman, _don't_ you? It's the worst imitation I ever heard. _You_<br> Peter Wilks's brother! You're a fraud, that's what you are!’<br><br> Well, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried to<br> quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd<br> showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name,<br> and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt<br> Harvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings, and all that. But it<br> warn't no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended<br> to be an Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what<br> he did was a fraud and a liar. The poor girls was hanging to the king<br> and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_. He<br> says:<br><br> ‘I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a<br> friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of<br> harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing<br> to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,<br> as he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor--has come here<br> with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and<br> you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these<br> foolish friends here, who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, you<br> know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. Now listen<br> to me; turn this pitiful rascal out--I _beg_ you to do it. Will you?’<br><br> Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She<br> says:<br><br> ‘_Here_ is my answer.’ She hove up the bag of money and put it in the<br> king's hands, and says, ‘Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for<br> me and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt for<br> it.’<br><br> Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the<br> hare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and<br> stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his<br> head and smiled proud. The doctor says:<br><br> ‘All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a<br> time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this<br> day.’ And away he went.<br><br> ‘All right, doctor,’ says the king, kinder mocking him; ‘we'll try and<br> get 'em to send for you;’ which made them all laugh, and they said it<br> was a prime good hit.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVI.<br><br> WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off<br> for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for<br> Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was<br> a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and<br> sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.<br> The king said the cubby would do for his valley--meaning me.<br><br> So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was<br> plain but nice. She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps<br> took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said<br> they warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was<br> a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an<br> old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts<br> of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room<br> with. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for<br> these fixings, and so don't disturb them. The duke's room was pretty<br> small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.<br><br> That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,<br> and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them,<br> and the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of<br> the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits<br> was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried<br> chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to<br> force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,<br> and said so--said ‘How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?’ and<br> ‘Where, for the land's sake, _did_ you get these amaz'n pickles?’ and<br> all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a<br> supper, you know.<br><br> And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen<br> off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up<br> the things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest<br> if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She says:<br><br> ‘Did you ever see the king?’<br><br> ‘Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have--he goes to our church.’ I<br> knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he<br> goes to our church, she says:<br><br> ‘What--regular?’<br><br> ‘Yes--regular. His pew's right over opposite ourn--on t'other side the<br> pulpit.’<br><br> ‘I thought he lived in London?’<br><br> ‘Well, he does. Where _would_ he live?’<br><br> ‘But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?’<br><br> I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken<br> bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:<br><br> ‘I mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield. That's<br> only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.’<br><br> ‘Why, how you talk--Sheffield ain't on the sea.’<br><br> ‘Well, who said it was?’<br><br> ‘Why, you did.’<br><br> ‘I _didn't_ nuther.’<br><br> ‘You did!’<br><br> ‘I didn't.’<br><br> ‘You did.’<br><br> ‘I never said nothing of the kind.’<br><br> ‘Well, what _did_ you say, then?’<br><br> ‘Said he come to take the sea _baths_--that's what I said.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the<br> sea?’<br><br> ‘Looky here,’ I says; ‘did you ever see any Congress-water?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?’<br><br> ‘Why, no.’<br><br> ‘Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea<br> bath.’<br><br> ‘How does he get it, then?’<br><br> ‘Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water--in barrels. There<br> in the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants his water<br> hot. They can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.<br> They haven't got no conveniences for it.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved<br> time.’<br><br> When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was<br> comfortable and glad. Next, she says:<br><br> ‘Do you go to church, too?’<br><br> ‘Yes--regular.’<br><br> ‘Where do you set?’<br><br> ‘Why, in our pew.’<br><br> ‘_Whose_ pew?’<br><br> ‘Why, _ourn_--your Uncle Harvey's.’<br><br> ‘His'n? What does _he_ want with a pew?’<br><br> ‘Wants it to set in. What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?’<br><br> ‘Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit.’<br><br> Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I<br> played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:<br><br> ‘Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church?’<br><br> ‘Why, what do they want with more?’<br><br> ‘What!--to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you.<br> They don't have no less than seventeen.’<br><br> ‘Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn't set out such a string as that,<br> not if I _never_ got to glory. It must take 'em a week.’<br><br> ‘Shucks, they don't _all_ of 'em preach the same day--only _one_ of 'em.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?’<br><br> ‘Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate--and one thing or<br> another. But mainly they don't do nothing.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what are they _for_?’<br><br> ‘Why, they're for _style_. Don't you know nothing?’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't _want_ to know no such foolishness as that. How is<br> servants treated in England? Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our<br> niggers?’<br><br> ‘_No_! A servant ain't nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.’<br><br> ‘Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's<br> week, and Fourth of July?’<br><br> ‘Oh, just listen! A body could tell _you_ hain't ever been to England<br> by that. Why, Hare-l--why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year's<br> end to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger<br> shows, nor nowheres.’<br><br> ‘Nor church?’<br><br> ‘Nor church.’<br><br> ‘But _you_ always went to church.’<br><br> Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man's servant. But<br> next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was<br> different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he<br> wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the<br> law. But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she<br> warn't satisfied. She says:<br><br> ‘Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?’<br><br> ‘Honest injun,’ says I.<br><br> ‘None of it at all?’<br><br> ‘None of it at all. Not a lie in it,’ says I.<br><br> ‘Lay your hand on this book and say it.’<br><br> I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and<br> said it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:<br><br> ‘Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll<br> believe the rest.’<br><br> ‘What is it you won't believe, Joe?’ says Mary Jane, stepping in with<br> Susan behind her. ‘It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him,<br> and him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you like to be<br> treated so?’<br><br> ‘That's always your way, Maim--always sailing in to help somebody before<br> they're hurt. I hain't done nothing to him. He's told some stretchers,<br> I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit<br> and grain I _did_ say. I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,<br> can't he?’<br><br> ‘I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in<br> our house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it. If you<br> was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to<br> say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.’<br><br> ‘Why, Mam, he said--’<br><br> ‘It don't make no difference what he _said_--that ain't the thing. The<br> thing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make<br> him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks.’<br><br> I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I'm letting that old reptile rob<br> her of her money!<br><br> Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give<br> Hare-lip hark from the tomb!<br><br> Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her<br> of her money!<br><br> Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely<br> again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly<br> anything left o' poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.<br><br> ‘All right, then,’ says the other girls; ‘you just ask his pardon.’<br><br> She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful<br> it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so<br> she could do it again.<br><br> I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I'm letting him rob her of<br> her money. And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves<br> out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so<br> ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up;<br> I'll hive that money for them or bust.<br><br> So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When<br> I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself,<br> shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No--that<br> won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would<br> make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No--I<br> dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the<br> money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it. If she was to<br> fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,<br> I judge. No; there ain't no good way but one. I got to steal that<br> money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion<br> that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going<br> to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're<br> worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and<br> by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell<br> Mary Jane where it's hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can,<br> because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he<br> might scare them out of here yet.<br><br> So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was<br> dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with<br> my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let<br> anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to<br> his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing<br> without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd<br> got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time<br> I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I<br> reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched<br> the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and<br> snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.<br><br> They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to<br> get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed<br> when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under<br> the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and<br> the king says:<br><br> ‘Well, what is it? And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for<br> us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a<br> chance to talk us over.’<br><br> ‘Well, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That<br> doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got a<br> notion, and I think it's a sound one.’<br><br> ‘What is it, duke?’<br><br> ‘That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip<br> it down the river with what we've got. Specially, seeing we got it so<br> easy--_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of<br> course we allowed to have to steal it back. I'm for knocking off and<br> lighting out.’<br><br> That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a been<br> a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The<br> king rips out and says:<br><br> ‘What! And not sell out the rest o' the property? March off like<br> a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'<br> property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good,<br> salable stuff, too.’<br><br> The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't<br> want to go no deeper--didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_<br> they had.<br><br> ‘Why, how you talk!’ says the king. ‘We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at<br> all but jest this money. The people that _buys_ the property is the<br> suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--which<br> won't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all<br> go back to the estate. These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin,<br> and that's enough for _them_; they're young and spry, and k'n easy<br> earn a livin'. _they_ ain't a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think--there's<br> thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off. Bless you, _they_<br> ain't got noth'n' to complain of.’<br><br> Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all<br> right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that<br> doctor hanging over them. But the king says:<br><br> ‘Cuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for _him_? Hain't we got all the<br> fools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority in any<br> town?’<br><br> So they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says:<br><br> ‘I don't think we put that money in a good place.’<br><br> That cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of<br> no kind to help me. The king says:<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know<br> the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds<br> up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and<br> not borrow some of it?’<br><br> ‘Your head's level agin, duke,’ says the king; and he comes a-fumbling<br> under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to<br> the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them<br> fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what<br> I'd better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag before<br> I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned<br> I was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw<br> tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two<br> amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only<br> makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about<br> twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.<br><br> But I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way<br> down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I<br> could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside<br> of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the<br> house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in,<br> with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted<br> to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By and by I<br> heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid<br> with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was<br> going to happen. But nothing did.<br><br> So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't<br> begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVII.<br><br> I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed<br> along, and got down stairs all right. There warn't a sound anywheres.<br> I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that<br> was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door<br> was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a<br> candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but<br> I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I<br> shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there.<br> Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I<br> run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I<br> see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about<br> a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over<br> it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just<br> down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was<br> so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.<br><br> The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and<br> kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see<br> she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me. I<br> slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them<br> watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything<br> was all right. They hadn't stirred.<br><br> I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing<br> playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much<br> resk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because<br> when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to<br> Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the<br> thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the<br> money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king<br> 'll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody<br> another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide<br> down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it. Every minute it was<br> getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin<br> to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my<br> hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of. I don't wish to be<br> mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.<br><br> When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the<br> watchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the<br> widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything<br> had been happening, but I couldn't tell.<br><br> Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they<br> set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then<br> set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till<br> the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin<br> lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with<br> folks around.<br><br> Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took<br> seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour<br> the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the<br> dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was<br> all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding<br> handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a<br> little. There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on<br> the floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a<br> funeral than they do at other places except church.<br><br> When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his<br> black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last<br> touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,<br> and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people<br> around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done<br> it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over<br> against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever<br> see; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.<br><br> They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready<br> a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and<br> colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one<br> that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson<br> opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most<br> outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only<br> one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right<br> along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you<br> couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody<br> didn't seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that<br> long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,<br> ‘Don't you worry--just depend on me.’ Then he stooped down and begun<br> to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's<br> heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and<br> more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two<br> sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds<br> we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or<br> two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn<br> talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's<br> back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and<br> glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his<br> mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,<br> over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, ‘_He<br> had a rat_!’ Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to<br> his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,<br> because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don't<br> cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be<br> looked up to and liked. There warn't no more popular man in town than<br> what that undertaker was.<br><br> Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and<br> then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and<br> at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the<br> coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him<br> pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as<br> soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I<br> didn't know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s'pose<br> somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether<br> to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find<br> nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get<br> hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at<br> all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it<br> a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch<br> the whole business!<br><br> They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces<br> again--I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. But nothing come of<br> it; the faces didn't tell me nothing.<br><br> The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,<br> and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his<br> congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must<br> hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was<br> very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could<br> stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. And he<br> said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and<br> that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed<br> and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled<br> them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told<br> him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them<br> poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them<br> getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to<br> chip in and change the general tune.<br><br> Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all<br> the property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;<br> but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.<br><br> So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy<br> got the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king<br> sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called<br> it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their<br> mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them<br> niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each<br> other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls<br> said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold<br> away from the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of<br> them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks<br> and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had<br> to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no<br> account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.<br><br> The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out<br> flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the<br> children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he<br> bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell<br> you the duke was powerful uneasy.<br><br> Next day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and<br> the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look<br> that there was trouble. The king says:<br><br> ‘Was you in my room night before last?’<br><br> ‘No, your majesty’--which was the way I always called him when nobody but<br> our gang warn't around.<br><br> ‘Was you in there yisterday er last night?’<br><br> ‘No, your majesty.’<br><br> ‘Honor bright, now--no lies.’<br><br> ‘Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. I hain't been<br> a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed<br> it to you.’<br><br> The duke says:<br><br> ‘Have you seen anybody else go in there?’<br><br> ‘No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.’<br><br> ‘Stop and think.’<br><br> I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:<br><br> ‘Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.’<br><br> Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever<br> expected it, and then like they _had_. Then the duke says:<br><br> ‘What, all of them?’<br><br> ‘No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don't think I ever see them<br> all come _out_ at once but just one time.’<br><br> ‘Hello! When was that?’<br><br> ‘It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn't early,<br> because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see<br> them.’<br><br> ‘Well, go on, _go_ on! What did they do? How'd they act?’<br><br> ‘They didn't do nothing. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I<br> see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in<br> there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up;<br> and found you _warn't_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the<br> way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you<br> up.’<br><br> ‘Great guns, _this_ is a go!’ says the king; and both of them looked<br> pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a-thinking and<br> scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a<br> little raspy chuckle, and says:<br><br> ‘It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on<br> to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region! And I believed they<br> _was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody. Don't ever tell _me_<br> any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. Why, the way<br> they played that thing it would fool _anybody_. In my opinion, there's<br> a fortune in 'em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a<br> better lay-out than that--and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song.<br> Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where _is_ that<br> song--that draft?’<br><br> ‘In the bank for to be collected. Where _would_ it be?’<br><br> ‘Well, _that's_ all right then, thank goodness.’<br><br> Says I, kind of timid-like:<br><br> ‘Is something gone wrong?’<br><br> The king whirls on me and rips out:<br><br> ‘None o' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own<br> affairs--if you got any. Long as you're in this town don't you forgit<br> _that_--you hear?’ Then he says to the duke, ‘We got to jest swaller it<br> and say noth'n': mum's the word for _us_.’<br><br> As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and<br> says:<br><br> ‘Quick sales _and_ small profits! It's a good business--yes.’<br><br> The king snarls around on him and says:<br><br> ‘I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick. If the<br> profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to<br> carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?’<br><br> ‘Well, _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn't_ if I could a got<br> my advice listened to.’<br><br> The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped<br> around and lit into _me_ again. He give me down the banks for not<br> coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting<br> that way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up. And then<br> waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not<br> laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be<br> blamed if he'd ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt<br> dreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't<br> done the niggers no harm by it.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVIII.<br><br> BY and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and started<br> for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and<br> I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd<br> been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England. But she<br> had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her<br> hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I<br> went in there and says:<br><br> ‘Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I<br> can't--most always. Tell me about it.’<br><br> So she done it. And it was the niggers--I just expected it. She said<br> the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn't<br> know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and<br> the children warn't ever going to see each other no more--and then busted<br> out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:<br><br> ‘Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't _ever_ going to see each other any<br> more!’<br><br> ‘But they _will_--and inside of two weeks--and I _know_ it!’ says I.<br><br> Laws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she<br> throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it<br> _again_, say it _again_!<br><br> I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close<br> place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very<br> impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and<br> eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to<br> studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells<br> the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,<br> though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it<br> looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it<br> don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.<br> I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's<br> so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I<br> says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the<br> truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of<br> powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:<br><br> ‘Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you<br> could go and stay three or four days?’<br><br> ‘Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?’<br><br> ‘Never mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see<br> each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and _prove_ how<br> I know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?’<br><br> ‘Four days!’ she says; ‘I'll stay a year!’<br><br> ‘All right,’ I says, ‘I don't want nothing more out of _you_ than just<br> your word--I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible.’ She<br> smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, ‘If you don't mind it,<br> I'll shut the door--and bolt it.’<br><br> Then I come back and set down again, and says:<br><br> ‘Don't you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to<br> tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a<br> bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for<br> it. These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of<br> frauds--regular dead-beats. There, now we're over the worst of it, you<br> can stand the rest middling easy.’<br><br> It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal<br> water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher<br> all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck<br> that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she<br> flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed<br> her sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face<br> afire like sunset, and says:<br><br> ‘The brute! Come, don't waste a minute--not a _second_--we'll have them<br> tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!’<br><br> Says I:<br><br> ‘Cert'nly. But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or--’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she says, ‘what am I _thinking_ about!’ she says, and set right<br> down again. ‘Don't mind what I said--please don't--you _won't,_ now,<br> _will_ you?’ Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that<br> I said I would die first. ‘I never thought, I was so stirred up,’ she<br> says; ‘now go on, and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to do,<br> and whatever you say I'll do it.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ I says, ‘it's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed so<br> I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I<br> druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would<br> get me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another<br> person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble. Well, we<br> got to save _him_, hain't we? Of course. Well, then, we won't blow on<br> them.’<br><br> Saying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could<br> get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.<br> But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard<br> to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin working<br> till pretty late to-night. I says:<br><br> ‘Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay<br> at Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther. How fur is it?’<br><br> ‘A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here.’<br><br> ‘Well, that 'll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low<br> till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home<br> again--tell them you've thought of something. If you get here before<br> eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait _till_<br> eleven, and _then_ if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the<br> way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get<br> these beats jailed.’<br><br> ‘Good,’ she says, ‘I'll do it.’<br><br> ‘And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along<br> with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,<br> and you must stand by me all you can.’<br><br> ‘Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!’<br> she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said<br> it, too.<br><br> ‘If I get away I sha'n't be here,’ I says, ‘to prove these rapscallions<br> ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I _was_ here. I could swear<br> they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something.<br> Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're<br> people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be. I'll tell you<br> how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There--'Royal<br> Nonesuch, Bricksville.' Put it away, and don't lose it. When the<br> court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to<br> Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,<br> and ask for some witnesses--why, you'll have that entire town down here<br> before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they'll come a-biling, too.’<br><br> I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:<br><br> ‘Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry. Nobody don't<br> have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction<br> on accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till<br> they get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to<br> count, and they ain't going to get no money. It's just like the way<br> it was with the niggers--it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be<br> back before long. Why, they can't collect the money for the _niggers_<br> yet--they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ she says, ‘I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start<br> straight for Mr. Lothrop's.’<br><br> ‘'Deed, _that_ ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,’ I says, ‘by no manner<br> of means; go _before_ breakfast.’<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?’<br><br> ‘Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don't know. What was it?’<br><br> ‘Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't<br> want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and<br> read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your<br> uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--’<br><br> ‘There, there, don't! Yes, I'll go before breakfast--I'll be glad to.<br> And leave my sisters with them?’<br><br> ‘Yes; never mind about them. They've got to stand it yet a while. They<br> might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don't want you to<br> see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was<br> to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.<br> No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of<br> them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say<br> you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or<br> to see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning.’<br><br> ‘Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to<br> them.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, it sha'n't be.’ It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no<br> harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it's<br> the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below;<br> it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing. Then<br> I says: ‘There's one more thing--that bag of money.’<br><br> ‘Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think<br> _how_ they got it.’<br><br> ‘No, you're out, there. They hain't got it.’<br><br> ‘Why, who's got it?’<br><br> ‘I wish I knowed, but I don't. I _had_ it, because I stole it from<br> them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm<br> afraid it ain't there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm<br> just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I<br> come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I<br> come to, and run--and it warn't a good place.’<br><br> ‘Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow<br> it--you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault. Where did you hide it?’<br><br> I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I<br> couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that<br> corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So<br> for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:<br><br> ‘I'd ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't<br> mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and<br> you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to. Do you<br> reckon that 'll do?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes.’<br><br> So I wrote: ‘I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was<br> crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was<br> mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.’<br><br> It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by<br> herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own<br> roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it<br> to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the<br> hand, hard, and says:<br><br> ‘_Good_-bye. I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if<br> I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of<br> you a many and a many a time, and I'll _pray_ for you, too!’--and she was<br> gone.<br><br> Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more<br> nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that<br> kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there<br> warn't no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but<br> in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in<br> my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it<br> ain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she<br> lays over them all. I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see<br> her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon<br> I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying<br> she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good<br> for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.<br><br> Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see<br> her go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:<br><br> ‘What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that<br> you all goes to see sometimes?’<br><br> They says:<br><br> ‘There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly.’<br><br> ‘That's the name,’ I says; ‘I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she<br> told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of<br> them's sick.’<br><br> ‘Which one?’<br><br> ‘I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's--’<br><br> ‘Sakes alive, I hope it ain't _Hanner_?’<br><br> ‘I'm sorry to say it,’ I says, ‘but Hanner's the very one.’<br><br> ‘My goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?’<br><br> ‘It ain't no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary<br> Jane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours.’<br><br> ‘Only think of that, now! What's the matter with her?’<br><br> I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:<br><br> ‘Mumps.’<br><br> ‘Mumps your granny! They don't set up with people that's got the<br> mumps.’<br><br> ‘They don't, don't they? You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.<br> These mumps is different. It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.’<br><br> ‘How's it a new kind?’<br><br> ‘Because it's mixed up with other things.’<br><br> ‘What other things?’<br><br> ‘Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and<br> yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all.’<br><br> ‘My land! And they call it the _mumps_?’<br><br> ‘That's what Miss Mary Jane said.’<br><br> ‘Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?’<br><br> ‘Why, because it _is_ the mumps. That's what it starts with.’<br><br> ‘Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take<br> pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains<br> out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull<br> up and say, 'Why, he stumped his _toe_.' Would ther' be any sense<br> in that? _No_. And ther' ain't no sense in _this_, nuther. Is it<br> ketching?’<br><br> ‘Is it _ketching_? Why, how you talk. Is a _harrow_ catching--in the<br> dark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another,<br> ain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the<br> whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a<br> harrow, as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you<br> come to get it hitched on good.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's awful, I think,’ says the hare-lip. ‘I'll go to Uncle<br> Harvey and--’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes,’ I says, ‘I _would_. Of _course_ I would. I wouldn't lose no<br> time.’<br><br> ‘Well, why wouldn't you?’<br><br> ‘Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain't your uncles<br> obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you<br> reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that<br> journey by yourselves? _you_ know they'll wait for you. So fur, so<br> good. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he? Very well, then; is a<br> _preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive<br> a _ship clerk?_--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now<br> _you_ know he ain't. What _will_ he do, then? Why, he'll say, 'It's a<br> great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they<br> can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps,<br> and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months<br> it takes to show on her if she's got it.' But never mind, if you think<br> it's best to tell your uncle Harvey--’<br><br> ‘Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good<br> times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's<br> got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.’<br><br> ‘Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors.’<br><br> ‘Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can't<br> you _see_ that _they'd_ go and tell? Ther' ain't no way but just to not<br> tell anybody at _all_.’<br><br> ‘Well, maybe you're right--yes, I judge you _are_ right.’<br><br> ‘But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while,<br> anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?’<br><br> ‘Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, 'Tell them to<br> give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over<br> the river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what _is_ the name of that rich family your<br> uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--’<br><br> ‘Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?’<br><br> ‘Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to<br> remember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run<br> over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy<br> this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had<br> it than anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they say<br> they'll come, and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and<br> if she is, she'll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don't say<br> nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which 'll be<br> perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying<br> the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.’<br><br> ‘All right,’ they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and<br> give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.<br><br> Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn't say nothing because<br> they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther<br> Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of<br> Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I<br> reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself. Of course he<br> would a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not<br> being brung up to it.<br><br> Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end<br> of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man<br> he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the<br> auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little<br> goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing<br> for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.<br><br> But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was<br> sold--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So<br> they'd got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was<br> for wanting to swallow _everything_. Well, whilst they was at it a<br> steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping<br> and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:<br><br> ‘_Here's_ your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old<br> Peter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIX.<br><br> THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a<br> nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my souls,<br> how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn't see no<br> joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some<br> to see any. I reckoned they'd turn pale. But no, nary a pale did<br> _they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but<br> just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's<br> googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed<br> down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in<br> his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the<br> world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people<br> gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old<br> gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty<br> soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an<br> Englishman--not the king's way, though the king's _was_ pretty good for<br> an imitation. I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate<br> him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:<br><br> ‘This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll<br> acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and<br> answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his<br> arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the<br> night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his<br> brother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to<br> amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with. We are<br> who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can<br> prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel<br> and wait.’<br><br> So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and<br> blethers out:<br><br> ‘Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain't_ it?--and very convenient, too,<br> for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how. Lost<br> their baggage! That's _mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the<br> _circumstances_!’<br><br> So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,<br> or maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was<br> a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind<br> made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and<br> was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and<br> then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone<br> up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along<br> and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the<br> king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:<br><br> ‘Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this<br> town?’<br><br> ‘The day before the funeral, friend,’ says the king.<br><br> ‘But what time o' day?’<br><br> ‘In the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown.’<br><br> ‘_How'd_ you come?’<br><br> ‘I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_'--in a<br> canoe?’<br><br> ‘I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'.’<br><br> ‘It's a lie.’<br><br> Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an<br> old man and a preacher.<br><br> ‘Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint<br> that mornin'. I live up there, don't I? Well, I was up there, and<br> he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim<br> Collins and a boy.’<br><br> The doctor he up and says:<br><br> ‘Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?’<br><br> ‘I reckon I would, but I don't know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know<br> him perfectly easy.’<br><br> It was me he pointed at. The doctor says:<br><br> ‘Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if<br> _these_ two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all. I think it's our<br> duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into<br> this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We'll take<br> these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I<br> reckon we'll find out _something_ before we get through.’<br><br> It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so<br> we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by<br> the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.<br><br> We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and<br> fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:<br><br> ‘I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're<br> frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.<br> If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter<br> Wilks left? It ain't unlikely. If these men ain't frauds, they won't<br> object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove<br> they're all right--ain't that so?’<br><br> Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty<br> tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked<br> sorrowful, and says:<br><br> ‘Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition<br> to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation<br> o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send<br> and see, if you want to.’<br><br> ‘Where is it, then?’<br><br> ‘Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it<br> inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few<br> days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'<br> used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.<br> The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down<br> stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got<br> clean away with it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.’<br><br> The doctor and several said ‘Shucks!’ and I see nobody didn't altogether<br> believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said<br> no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I<br> never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up<br> my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.<br> That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says:<br><br> ‘Are _you_ English, too?’<br><br> I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, ‘Stuff!’<br><br> Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had<br> it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about<br> supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and<br> kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They<br> made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;<br> and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the<br> old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. And by and by<br> they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed<br> look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the<br> right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,<br> and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty<br> fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:<br><br> ‘Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you. I reckon<br> you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is<br> practice. You do it pretty awkward.’<br><br> I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,<br> anyway.<br><br> The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:<br><br> ‘If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--’ The king broke in and<br> reached out his hand, and says:<br><br> ‘Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often<br> about?’<br><br> The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked<br> pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side<br> and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:<br><br> ‘That 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your<br> brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.’<br><br> So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted<br> his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;<br> and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the<br> duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer<br> turns to the new old gentleman and says:<br><br> ‘You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.’<br><br> The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer looked<br> powerful astonished, and says:<br><br> ‘Well, it beats _me_’--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,<br> and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then<br> _them_ again; and then says: ‘These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;<br> and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't<br> write them’ (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell<br> you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), ‘and here's _this_ old<br> gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't<br> write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at<br> all. Now, here's some letters from--’<br><br> The new old gentleman says:<br><br> ‘If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother<br> there--so he copies for me. It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.’<br><br> ‘_Well_!’ says the lawyer, ‘this _is_ a state of things. I've got some<br> of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we<br> can com--’<br><br> ‘He _can't_ write with his left hand,’ says the old gentleman. ‘If he<br> could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters<br> and mine too. Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.’<br><br> The lawyer done it, and says:<br><br> ‘I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger<br> resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I<br> thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,<br> partly. But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em<br> Wilkses’--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.<br><br> Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in<br> _then_! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said his<br> brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried<br> to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute<br> he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and<br> warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was<br> saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:<br><br> ‘I've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay<br> out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ says somebody, ‘me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here.’<br><br> Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:<br><br> ‘Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?’<br><br> Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a<br> squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took<br> him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make<br> most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any<br> notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?<br> He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in<br> there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says<br> I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.<br> Well, did he? A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. I reckon<br> he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so<br> they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.<br> Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:<br><br> ‘Mf! It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it! _yes_, sir, I k'n<br> tell you what's tattooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue<br> arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.<br> _now_ what do you say--hey?’<br><br> Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out<br> cheek.<br><br> The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and<br> his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and<br> says:<br><br> ‘There--you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter<br> Wilks' breast?’<br><br> Both of them spoke up and says:<br><br> ‘We didn't see no such mark.’<br><br> ‘Good!’ says the old gentleman. ‘Now, what you _did_ see on his breast<br> was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was<br> young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P--B--W’--and he marked<br> them that way on a piece of paper. ‘Come, ain't that what you saw?’<br><br> Both of them spoke up again, and says:<br><br> ‘No, we _didn't_. We never seen any marks at all.’<br><br> Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:<br><br> ‘The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!<br> le's ride 'em on a rail!’ and everybody was whooping at once, and there<br> was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,<br> and says:<br><br> ‘Gentlemen--gentle_men!_ Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you<br> _please_! There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.’<br><br> That took them.<br><br> ‘Hooray!’ they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer<br> and the doctor sung out:<br><br> ‘Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch<br> _them_ along, too!’<br><br> ‘We'll do it!’ they all shouted; ‘and if we don't find them marks we'll<br> lynch the whole gang!’<br><br> I _was_ scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you<br> know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the<br> graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole<br> town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the<br> evening.<br><br> As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;<br> because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and<br> blow on our dead-beats.<br><br> Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like<br> wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the<br> lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst<br> the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever<br> was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from<br> what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time<br> if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to<br> save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the<br> world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they<br> didn't find them--<br><br> I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think<br> about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful<br> time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the<br> wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He<br> dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.<br><br> When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it<br> like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had<br> about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't<br> thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the<br> flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a<br> mile off, to borrow one.<br><br> So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain<br> started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come<br> brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took<br> no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute<br> you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the<br> shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the<br> dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.<br><br> At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then<br> such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to<br> scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it<br> was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,<br> and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and<br> panting.<br><br> All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,<br> and somebody sings out:<br><br> ‘By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!’<br><br> Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and<br> give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit<br> out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.<br><br> I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all<br> to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the<br> buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of<br> the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!<br><br> When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so<br> I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the<br> main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and<br> set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and<br> disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by,<br> _flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up<br> sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind<br> me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this<br> world. She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.<br><br> The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the<br> towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first<br> time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and<br> shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope.<br> The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the<br> middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the<br> raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp<br> if I could afforded it. But I didn't. As I sprung aboard I sung out:<br><br> ‘Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we're shut<br> of them!’<br><br> Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so<br> full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up<br> in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King<br> Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and<br> lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and<br> bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the<br> king and the duke, but I says:<br><br> ‘Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and<br> let her slide!’<br><br> So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_<br> seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and<br> nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack<br> my heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crack<br> I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and<br> listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out<br> over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and<br> making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke.<br><br> So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was<br> all I could do to keep from crying.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXX.<br><br> WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,<br> and says:<br><br> ‘Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company,<br> hey?’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘No, your majesty, we warn't--_please_ don't, your majesty!’<br><br> ‘Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I'll shake the<br> insides out o' you!’<br><br> ‘Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.<br> The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he<br> had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry<br> to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by<br> surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go<br> of me and whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit<br> out. It didn't seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn't do nothing,<br> and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped<br> running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,<br> or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the<br> duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was<br> awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't.’<br><br> Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, ‘Oh,<br> yes, it's _mighty_ likely!’ and shook me up again, and said he reckoned<br> he'd drownd me. But the duke says:<br><br> ‘Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would _you_ a done any different? Did<br> you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose? I don't remember it.’<br><br> So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in<br> it. But the duke says:<br><br> ‘You better a blame' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you're<br> the one that's entitled to it most. You hain't done a thing from the<br> start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky<br> with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That _was_ bright--it was right<br> down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn't been<br> for that they'd a jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come--and<br> then--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the<br> graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the<br> excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a<br> look we'd a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,<br> too--longer than _we'd_ need 'em.’<br><br> They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of<br> absent-minded like:<br><br> ‘Mf! And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!’<br><br> That made me squirm!<br><br> ‘Yes,’ says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, ‘_we_<br> did.’<br><br> After about a half a minute the king drawls out:<br><br> ‘Leastways, I did.’<br><br> The duke says, the same way:<br><br> ‘On the contrary, I did.’<br><br> The king kind of ruffles up, and says:<br><br> ‘Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?’<br><br> The duke says, pretty brisk:<br><br> ‘When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was _you_<br> referring to?’<br><br> ‘Shucks!’ says the king, very sarcastic; ‘but I don't know--maybe you was<br> asleep, and didn't know what you was about.’<br><br> The duke bristles up now, and says:<br><br> ‘Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?<br> Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?’<br><br> ‘_Yes_, sir! I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!’<br><br> ‘It's a lie!’--and the duke went for him. The king sings out:<br><br> ‘Take y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!’<br><br> The duke says:<br><br> ‘Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,<br> intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig<br> it up, and have it all to yourself.’<br><br> ‘Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;<br> if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and<br> take back everything I said.’<br><br> ‘You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't. There, now!’<br><br> ‘Well, then, I b'lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more--now<br> _don't_ git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and<br> hide it?’<br><br> The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:<br><br> ‘Well, I don't care if I _did_, I didn't _do_ it, anyway. But you not<br> only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.’<br><br> ‘I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest. I won't say<br> I warn't goin' to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in<br> ahead o' me.’<br><br> ‘It's a lie! You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--’<br><br> The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:<br><br> ‘'Nough!--I _own up!_’<br><br> I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier<br> than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and<br> says:<br><br> ‘If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. It's _well_ for you to set<br> there and blubber like a baby--it's fitten for you, after the way<br> you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble<br> everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own<br> father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it<br> saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.<br> It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_<br> that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make<br> up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the Nonesuch<br> and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!’<br><br> The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:<br><br> ‘Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me.’<br><br> ‘Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!’ says the duke. ‘And<br> _now_ you see what you GOT by it. They've got all their own money back,<br> and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_. G'long to bed, and<br> don't you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long 's _you_ live!’<br><br> So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,<br> and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an<br> hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the<br> lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms. They<br> both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow<br> enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag<br> again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got<br> to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXI.<br><br> WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along<br> down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty<br> long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on<br> them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the<br> first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and<br> dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they<br> begun to work the villages again.<br><br> First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough<br> for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started<br> a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a<br> kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped<br> in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at<br> yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and<br> give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled<br> missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and<br> a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. So at<br> last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she<br> floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the<br> half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.<br><br> And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in<br> the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.<br> Jim and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged they<br> was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it<br> over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break<br> into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money<br> business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an<br> agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such<br> actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold<br> shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we<br> hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of<br> a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told<br> us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see<br> if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (‘House to<br> rob, you _mean_,’ says I to myself; ‘and when you get through robbing it<br> you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the<br> raft--and you'll have to take it out in wondering.’) And he said if he<br> warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and<br> we was to come along.<br><br> So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and<br> was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't<br> seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.<br> Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come<br> and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for _the_<br> change on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and<br> hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the<br> back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers<br> bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all<br> his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to<br> them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king<br> begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and<br> shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like<br> a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a<br> long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all<br> out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:<br><br> ‘Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!’<br><br> But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was<br> gone! I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run<br> this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't<br> no use--old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help<br> it. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road,<br> trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and<br> asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Whereabouts?’ says I.<br><br> ‘Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here. He's a runaway<br> nigger, and they've got him. Was you looking for him?’<br><br> ‘You bet I ain't! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two<br> ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to lay<br> down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard<br> to come out.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ he says, ‘you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him.<br> He run off f'm down South, som'ers.’<br><br> ‘It's a good job they got him.’<br><br> ‘Well, I _reckon_! There's two hunderd dollars reward on him. It's<br> like picking up money out'n the road.’<br><br> ‘Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him<br> _first_. Who nailed him?’<br><br> ‘It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for<br> forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait. Think<br> o' that, now! You bet _I'd_ wait, if it was seven year.’<br><br> ‘That's me, every time,’ says I. ‘But maybe his chance ain't worth<br> no more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's something<br> ain't straight about it.’<br><br> ‘But it _is_, though--straight as a string. I see the handbill myself.<br> It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells<br> the plantation he's frum, below Newr_leans_. No-sirree-_bob_, they<br> ain't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a<br> chaw tobacker, won't ye?’<br><br> I didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in the<br> wigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought till I wore<br> my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble. After all<br> this long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here it<br> was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because<br> they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make<br> him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty<br> dirty dollars.<br><br> Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to<br> be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd _got_ to be a<br> slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to<br> tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two<br> things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness<br> for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;<br> and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,<br> and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and<br> disgraced. And then think of _me_! It would get all around that Huck<br> Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see<br> anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots<br> for shame. That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and<br> then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he<br> can hide it, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I<br> studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the<br> more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when<br> it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence<br> slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being<br> watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a<br> poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was<br> showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going<br> to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further,<br> I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I<br> could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung<br> up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me<br> kept saying, ‘There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and<br> if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as<br> I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.’<br><br> It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I<br> couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So<br> I kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It<br> warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from _me_, neither. I<br> knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart warn't<br> right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing<br> double. I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was<br> holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth<br> _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write<br> to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I<br> knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie--I found<br> that out.<br><br> So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to<br> do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and<br> then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as<br> light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I<br> got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down<br> and wrote:<br><br> Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below<br> Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the<br> reward if you send.<br><br> _Huck Finn._<br><br> I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever<br> felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it<br> straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking<br> how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost<br> and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our<br> trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day<br> and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we<br> a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I<br> couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the<br> other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of<br> calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when<br> I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,<br> up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call<br> me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how<br> good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling<br> the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was<br> the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's<br> got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.<br><br> It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was<br> a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and<br> I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then<br> says to myself:<br><br> ‘All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell’--and tore it up.<br><br> It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let<br> them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the<br> whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,<br> which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And<br> for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;<br> and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as<br> long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.<br><br> Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some<br> considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that<br> suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down<br> the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my<br> raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the<br> night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,<br> and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or<br> another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed<br> below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,<br> and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and<br> sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter<br> of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.<br><br> Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on<br> it, ‘Phelps's Sawmill,’ and when I come to the farm-houses, two or<br> three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't<br> see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind,<br> because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the<br> lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from<br> the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along,<br> straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was<br> the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night<br> performance--like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I<br> was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:<br><br> ‘Hel-_lo_! Where'd _you_ come from?’ Then he says, kind of glad and<br> eager, ‘Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.’<br><br> Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:<br><br> ‘What was your idea for asking _me_?’ he says.<br><br> ‘Well,’ I says, ‘when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says<br> to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went<br> a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered<br> me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch<br> a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,<br> and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him<br> along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after<br> him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the<br> country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we<br> fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and<br> see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to<br> leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in<br> the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property<br> no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and<br> cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what _did_ become of the<br> raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!’<br><br> ‘Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft. That old fool had<br> made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery<br> the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but<br> what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and<br> found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and<br> shook us, and run off down the river.'‘<br><br> ‘I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the<br> world, and the only property.’<br><br> ‘We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him<br> _our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble<br> enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,<br> there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another<br> shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's<br> that ten cents? Give it here.’<br><br> I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to<br> spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the<br> money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never<br> said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:<br><br> ‘Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We'd skin him if he done<br> that!’<br><br> ‘How can he blow? Hain't he run off?’<br><br> ‘No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's<br> gone.’<br><br> ‘_Sold_ him?’ I says, and begun to cry; ‘why, he was _my_ nigger, and<br> that was my money. Where is he?--I want my nigger.’<br><br> ‘Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your<br> blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?<br> Blamed if I think I'd trust you. Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--’<br><br> He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes<br> before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:<br><br> ‘I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.<br> I got to turn out and find my nigger.’<br><br> He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on<br> his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:<br><br> ‘I'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you'll<br> promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you<br> where to find him.’<br><br> So I promised, and he says:<br><br> ‘A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--’ and then he stopped. You see, he<br> started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to<br> study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he<br> was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of<br> the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:<br><br> ‘The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he<br> lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.’<br><br> ‘All right,’ I says, ‘I can walk it in three days. And I'll start this<br> very afternoon.’<br><br> ‘No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,<br> neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in<br> your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with<br> _us_, d'ye hear?’<br><br> That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I<br> wanted to be left free to work my plans.<br><br> ‘So clear out,’ he says; ‘and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want<br> to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some<br> idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down<br> South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,<br> maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for<br> getting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but<br> mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.’<br><br> So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around, but I<br> kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out<br> at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before<br> I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'. I<br> reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling<br> around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could<br> get away. I didn't want no trouble with their kind. I'd seen all I<br> wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXII.<br><br> WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;<br> the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint<br> dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and<br> like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers<br> the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's<br> spirits whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and you<br> always think they're talking about _you_. As a general thing it makes a<br> body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.<br><br> Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they<br> all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out<br> of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different<br> length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when<br> they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the<br> big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the<br> nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs,<br> with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes<br> been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big<br> broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house<br> back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other<br> side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against<br> the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side;<br> ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by<br> the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there<br> in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away<br> off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place<br> by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then<br> the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.<br><br> I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and<br> started for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum<br> of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;<br> and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that _is_ the<br> lonesomest sound in the whole world.<br><br> I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting<br> to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for<br> I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth<br> if I left it alone.<br><br> When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went<br> for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And<br> such another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind<br> of a hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of<br> fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses<br> stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you<br> could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.<br><br> A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her<br> hand, singing out, ‘Begone _you_ Tige! you Spot! begone sah!’ and she<br> fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,<br> and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,<br> wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. There ain't<br> no harm in a hound, nohow.<br><br> And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger<br> boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their<br> mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way<br> they always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house,<br> about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick<br> in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the<br> same way the little niggers was doing. She was smiling all over so she<br> could hardly stand--and says:<br><br> ‘It's _you_, at last!--_ain't_ it?’<br><br> I out with a ‘Yes'm’ before I thought.<br><br> She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands<br> and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;<br> and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, ‘You<br> don't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law<br> sakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it<br> does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it's your cousin Tom!--tell<br> him howdy.’<br><br> But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and<br> hid behind her. So she run on:<br><br> ‘Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get<br> your breakfast on the boat?’<br><br> I said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house,<br> leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got<br> there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on<br> a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:<br><br> ‘Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry<br> for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come<br> at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What kep'<br> you?--boat get aground?’<br><br> ‘Yes'm--she--’<br><br> ‘Don't say yes'm--say Aunt Sally. Where'd she get aground?’<br><br> I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the<br> boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on<br> instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards<br> Orleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names<br> of bars down that way. I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the<br> name of the one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched<br> it out:<br><br> ‘It warn't the grounding--that didn't keep us back but a little. We<br> blowed out a cylinder-head.’<br><br> ‘Good gracious! anybody hurt?’<br><br> ‘No'm. Killed a nigger.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago<br> last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old<br> Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And<br> I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed<br> a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I<br> remember now, he _did_ die. Mortification set in, and they had to<br> amputate him. But it didn't save him. Yes, it was mortification--that<br> was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious<br> resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle's been up<br> to the town every day to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an<br> hour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road,<br> didn't you?--oldish man, with a--’<br><br> ‘No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight,<br> and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town<br> and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too<br> soon; and so I come down the back way.’<br><br> ‘Who'd you give the baggage to?’<br><br> ‘Nobody.’<br><br> ‘Why, child, it 'll be stole!’<br><br> ‘Not where I hid it I reckon it won't,’ I says.<br><br> ‘How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?’<br><br> It was kinder thin ice, but I says:<br><br> ‘The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something<br> to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers'<br> lunch, and give me all I wanted.’<br><br> I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. I had my mind on the<br> children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump<br> them a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.<br> Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills<br> streak all down my back, because she says:<br><br> ‘But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word<br> about Sis, nor any of them. Now I'll rest my works a little, and you<br> start up yourn; just tell me _everything_--tell me all about 'm all every<br> one of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told<br> you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.’<br><br> Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. Providence had stood by<br> me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now. I see it<br> warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand. So<br> I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth.<br> I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind<br> the bed, and says:<br><br> ‘Here he comes! Stick your head down lower--there, that'll do; you can't<br> be seen now. Don't you let on you're here. I'll play a joke on him.<br> Children, don't you say a word.’<br><br> I see I was in a fix now. But it warn't no use to worry; there warn't<br> nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from<br> under when the lightning struck.<br><br> I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then<br> the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:<br><br> ‘Has he come?’<br><br> ‘No,’ says her husband.<br><br> ‘Good-_ness_ gracious!’ she says, ‘what in the warld can have become of<br> him?’<br><br> ‘I can't imagine,’ says the old gentleman; ‘and I must say it makes me<br> dreadful uneasy.’<br><br> ‘Uneasy!’ she says; ‘I'm ready to go distracted! He _must_ a come; and<br> you've missed him along the road. I _know_ it's so--something tells me<br> so.’<br><br> ‘Why, Sally, I _couldn't_ miss him along the road--_you_ know that.’<br><br> ‘But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say! He must a come! You must a<br> missed him. He--’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed. I don't know<br> what in the world to make of it. I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind<br> acknowledging 't I'm right down scared. But there's no hope that he's<br> come; for he _couldn't_ come and me miss him. Sally, it's terrible--just<br> terrible--something's happened to the boat, sure!’<br><br> ‘Why, Silas! Look yonder!--up the road!--ain't that somebody coming?’<br><br> He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.<br> Phelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the<br> bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the<br> window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and<br> I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared,<br> and says:<br><br> ‘Why, who's that?’<br><br> ‘Who do you reckon 't is?’<br><br> ‘I hain't no idea. Who _is_ it?’<br><br> ‘It's _Tom Sawyer!_’<br><br> By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn't no time to<br> swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on<br> shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and<br> cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,<br> and the rest of the tribe.<br><br> But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like<br> being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze<br> to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't<br> hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the<br> Sawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I<br> explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of<br> White River, and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right,<br> and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn't know but what it would take<br> three days to fix it. If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done<br> just as well.<br><br> Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty<br> uncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and<br> comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a<br> steamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself, s'pose<br> Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? And s'pose he steps in here any<br> minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep<br> quiet?<br><br> Well, I couldn't _have_ it that way; it wouldn't do at all. I must go<br> up the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I reckoned I would go<br> up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman was for<br> going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and<br> I druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIII.<br><br> SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a<br> wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and<br> waited till he come along. I says ‘Hold on!’ and it stopped alongside,<br> and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed<br> two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:<br><br> ‘I hain't ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, what you<br> want to come back and ha'nt _me_ for?’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘I hain't come back--I hain't been _gone_.’<br><br> When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't quite<br> satisfied yet. He says:<br><br> ‘Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you. Honest injun<br> now, you ain't a ghost?’<br><br> ‘Honest injun, I ain't,’ I says.<br><br> ‘Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can't somehow<br> seem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn't you ever murdered _at<br> all?_’<br><br> ‘No. I warn't ever murdered at all--I played it on them. You come in<br> here and feel of me if you don't believe me.’<br><br> So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me<br> again he didn't know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it<br> right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it<br> hit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and<br> told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told<br> him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He<br> said, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him. So he thought and<br> thought, and pretty soon he says:<br><br> ‘It's all right; I've got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on<br> it's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the<br> house about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and<br> take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;<br> and you needn't let on to know me at first.’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘All right; but wait a minute. There's one more thing--a thing that<br> _nobody_ don't know but me. And that is, there's a nigger here that<br> I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_--old Miss<br> Watson's Jim.’<br><br> He says:<br><br> ‘What! Why, Jim is--’<br><br> He stopped and went to studying. I says:<br><br> ‘I know what you'll say. You'll say it's dirty, low-down business; but<br> what if it is? I'm low down; and I'm a-going to steal him, and I want<br> you keep mum and not let on. Will you?’<br><br> His eye lit up, and he says:<br><br> ‘I'll _help_ you steal him!’<br><br> Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most<br> astonishing speech I ever heard--and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell<br> considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer<br> a _nigger-stealer!_<br><br> ‘Oh, shucks!’ I says; ‘you're joking.’<br><br> ‘I ain't joking, either.’<br><br> ‘Well, then,’ I says, ‘joking or no joking, if you hear anything said<br> about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that _you_ don't know<br> nothing about him, and I don't know nothing about him.’<br><br> Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his<br> way and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on<br> accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too<br> quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and<br> he says:<br><br> ‘Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in that mare<br> to do it? I wish we'd a timed her. And she hain't sweated a hair--not<br> a hair. It's wonderful. Why, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that<br> horse now--I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen before,<br> and thought 'twas all she was worth.’<br><br> That's all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.<br> But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he was<br> a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the<br> plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church<br> and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was<br> worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and<br> done the same way, down South.<br><br> In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt<br> Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty<br> yards, and says:<br><br> ‘Why, there's somebody come! I wonder who 'tis? Why, I do believe it's<br> a stranger. Jimmy’ (that's one of the children) ‘run and tell Lize to<br> put on another plate for dinner.’<br><br> Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger<br> don't come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for<br> interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for<br> the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we<br> was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an<br> audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances<br> it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was<br> suitable. He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,<br> he come ca'm and important, like the ram. When he got a-front of us he<br> lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box<br> that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them,<br> and says:<br><br> ‘Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?’<br><br> ‘No, my boy,’ says the old gentleman, ‘I'm sorry to say 't your driver<br> has deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more.<br> Come in, come in.’<br><br> Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, ‘Too late--he's out<br> of sight.’<br><br> ‘Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with<br> us; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I _can't_ make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it. I'll<br> walk--I don't mind the distance.’<br><br> ‘But we won't _let_ you walk--it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to do<br> it. Come right in.’<br><br> ‘Oh, _do_,’ says Aunt Sally; ‘it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a<br> bit in the world. You must stay. It's a long, dusty three mile, and<br> we can't let you walk. And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on<br> another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us. Come<br> right in and make yourself at home.’<br><br> So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be<br> persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger<br> from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made<br> another bow.<br><br> Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and<br> everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and<br> wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,<br> still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the<br> mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was<br> going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of<br> her hand, and says:<br><br> ‘You owdacious puppy!’<br><br> He looked kind of hurt, and says:<br><br> ‘I'm surprised at you, m'am.’<br><br> ‘You're s'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am? I've a good notion to take<br> and--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?’<br><br> He looked kind of humble, and says:<br><br> ‘I didn't mean nothing, m'am. I didn't mean no harm. I--I--thought you'd<br> like it.’<br><br> ‘Why, you born fool!’ She took up the spinning stick, and it looked<br> like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.<br> ‘What made you think I'd like it?’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know. Only, they--they--told me you would.’<br><br> ‘_They_ told you I would. Whoever told you's _another_ lunatic. I<br> never heard the beat of it. Who's _they_?’<br><br> ‘Why, everybody. They all said so, m'am.’<br><br> It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her<br> fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:<br><br> ‘Who's 'everybody'? Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot<br> short.’<br><br> He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:<br><br> ‘I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. They told me to. They all told<br> me to. They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it. They all said<br> it--every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more--I<br> won't, honest.’<br><br> ‘You won't, won't you? Well, I sh'd _reckon_ you won't!’<br><br> ‘No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again--till you ask me.’<br><br> ‘Till I _ask_ you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!<br> I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask<br> you--or the likes of you.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ he says, ‘it does surprise me so. I can't make it out, somehow.<br> They said you would, and I thought you would. But--’ He stopped and<br> looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye<br> somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, ‘Didn't<br> _you_ think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?’<br><br> ‘Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b'lieve I didn't.’<br><br> Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:<br><br> ‘Tom, didn't _you_ think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say, 'Sid<br> Sawyer--'‘<br><br> ‘My land!’ she says, breaking in and jumping for him, ‘you impudent<br> young rascal, to fool a body so--’ and was going to hug him, but he<br> fended her off, and says:<br><br> ‘No, not till you've asked me first.’<br><br> So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed<br> him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he<br> took what was left. And after they got a little quiet again she says:<br><br> ‘Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn't looking for _you_<br> at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but<br> him.’<br><br> ‘It's because it warn't _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,’ he<br> says; ‘but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me<br> come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a<br> first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me<br> to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. But it<br> was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain't no healthy place for a stranger<br> to come.’<br><br> ‘No--not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I<br> hain't been so put out since I don't know when. But I don't care, I<br> don't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to<br> have you here. Well, to think of that performance! I don't deny it, I<br> was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.’<br><br> We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and<br> the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven<br> families--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid<br> in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of<br> old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long<br> blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,<br> neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.<br> There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me<br> and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they<br> didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid<br> to try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the little<br> boys says:<br><br> ‘Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?’<br><br> ‘No,’ says the old man, ‘I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you<br> couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and<br> me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the<br> people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town<br> before this time.’<br><br> So there it was!--but I couldn't help it. Tom and me was to sleep in the<br> same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to<br> bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the<br> lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was<br> going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up<br> and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.<br><br> On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,<br> and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and<br> what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our<br> Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had<br> time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of<br> it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of<br> people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin<br> pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;<br> and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a<br> rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was<br> all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the<br> world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big<br> soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for<br> them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any<br> hardness against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to<br> see. Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.<br><br> We see we was too late--couldn't do no good. We asked some stragglers<br> about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very<br> innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the<br> middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and<br> the house rose up and went for them.<br><br> So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was<br> before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though<br> I hadn't done nothing. But that's always the way; it don't make no<br> difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't<br> got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that<br> didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him.<br> It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet<br> ain't no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIV.<br><br> WE stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says:<br><br> ‘Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet I<br> know where Jim is.’<br><br> ‘No! Where?’<br><br> ‘In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at<br> dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘What did you think the vittles was for?’<br><br> ‘For a dog.’<br><br> ‘So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog.’<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘Because part of it was watermelon.’<br><br> ‘So it was--I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought<br> about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and<br> don't see at the same time.’<br><br> ‘Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it<br> again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up<br> from table--same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;<br> and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation,<br> and where the people's all so kind and good. Jim's the prisoner. All<br> right--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks<br> for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to<br> steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we like<br> the best.’<br><br> What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer's head I<br> wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown<br> in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan,<br> but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right<br> plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:<br><br> ‘Ready?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ I says.<br><br> ‘All right--bring it out.’<br><br> ‘My plan is this,’ I says. ‘We can easy find out if it's Jim in there.<br> Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the<br> island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the<br> old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river<br> on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and<br> Jim used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?’<br><br> ‘_Work_? Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it's<br> too blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it. What's the good of a<br> plan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as goose-milk.<br> Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap<br> factory.’<br><br> I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but<br> I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn't<br> have none of them objections to it.<br><br> And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was<br> worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man<br> as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,<br> and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here,<br> because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be<br> changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new<br> bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.<br><br> Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in<br> earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.<br> That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was<br> respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at<br> home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and<br> knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,<br> without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to<br> this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,<br> before everybody. I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all. It was<br> outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be<br> his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save<br> himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:<br><br> ‘Don't you reckon I know what I'm about? Don't I generly know what I'm<br> about?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Didn't I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘_Well_, then.’<br><br> That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say any<br> more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I<br> couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just<br> let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have<br> it so, I couldn't help it.<br><br> When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to<br> the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard<br> so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't make<br> no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by<br> in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and<br> the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the<br> north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just<br> one stout board nailed across it. I says:<br><br> ‘Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we<br> wrench off the board.’<br><br> Tom says:<br><br> ‘It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as<br> playing hooky. I should _hope_ we can find a way that's a little more<br> complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.’<br><br> ‘Well, then,’ I says, ‘how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done<br> before I was murdered that time?’<br><br> ‘That's more _like_,’ he says. ‘It's real mysterious, and troublesome,<br> and good,’ he says; ‘but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.<br> There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.’<br><br> Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that<br> joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long<br> as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was at<br> the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and<br> searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;<br> so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down,<br> and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,<br> and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection<br> with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but<br> some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.<br> The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and<br> the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;<br><br> ‘Now we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out. It 'll take about a week!’<br><br> Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have<br> to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that<br> warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must<br> climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three<br> times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most<br> busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he<br> was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this<br> time he made the trip.<br><br> In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins<br> to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it<br> _was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through<br> breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up<br> a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was<br> leaving, the key come from the house.<br><br> This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was<br> all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches<br> off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and<br> making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of<br> strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so<br> long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so<br> about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.<br> So Tom says:<br><br> ‘What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?’<br><br> The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you<br> heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:<br><br> ‘Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at<br> 'im?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> I hunched Tom, and whispers:<br><br> ‘You going, right here in the daybreak? _that_ warn't the plan.’<br><br> ‘No, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.’<br><br> So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in<br> we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure<br> enough, and could see us; and he sings out:<br><br> ‘Why, _Huck_! En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?’<br><br> I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know<br> nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger<br> busted in and says:<br><br> ‘Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?’<br><br> We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and<br> kind of wondering, and says:<br><br> ‘Does _who_ know us?’<br><br> ‘Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.’<br><br> ‘I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?’<br><br> ‘What _put_ it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed<br> you?’<br><br> Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:<br><br> ‘Well, that's mighty curious. _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?<br> _what_ did he sing out?’ And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,<br> ‘Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?’<br><br> Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:<br><br> ‘No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.’<br><br> Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,<br> and says:<br><br> ‘Did you sing out?’<br><br> ‘No, sah,’ says Jim; ‘I hain't said nothing, sah.’<br><br> ‘Not a word?’<br><br> ‘No, sah, I hain't said a word.’<br><br> ‘Did you ever see us before?’<br><br> ‘No, sah; not as I knows on.’<br><br> So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and<br> says, kind of severe:<br><br> ‘What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you think<br> somebody sung out?’<br><br> ‘Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.<br> Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so.<br> Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole<br> me; 'kase he say dey _ain't_ no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was<br> heah now--_den_ what would he say! I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to<br> git aroun' it _dis_ time. But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's _sot_,<br> stays sot; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en<br> when _you_ fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you.’<br><br> Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to<br> buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and<br> says:<br><br> ‘I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to<br> catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give<br> him up, I'd hang him.’ And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to<br> look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim<br> and says:<br><br> ‘Don't ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on<br> nights, it's us; we're going to set you free.’<br><br> Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger<br> come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted<br> us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the<br> witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks<br> around then.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXV.<br><br> IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down<br> into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how<br> to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;<br> what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called<br> fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a<br> dark place. We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down<br> to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:<br><br> ‘Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.<br> And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.<br> There ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there _ought_ to be a<br> watchman. There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And<br> there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his<br> bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off<br> the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the<br> punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim<br> could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be<br> no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it,<br> Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent _all_<br> the difficulties. Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can<br> with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more<br> honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,<br> where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was<br> their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your<br> own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you<br> come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern's<br> resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to,<br> I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to<br> make a saw out of the first chance we get.’<br><br> ‘What do we want of a saw?’<br><br> ‘What do we _want_ of it? Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed<br> off, so as to get the chain loose?’<br><br> ‘Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain<br> off.’<br><br> ‘Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. You _can_ get up the<br> infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain't you ever read<br> any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,<br> nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of getting a<br> prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the way all the<br> best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just<br> so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and<br> grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see<br> no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.<br> Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip<br> off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your<br> rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the<br> moat--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and<br> there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and<br> fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or<br> Navarre, or wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat<br> to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one.’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under<br> the cabin?’<br><br> But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had<br> his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his<br> head; then sighs again, and says:<br><br> ‘No, it wouldn't do--there ain't necessity enough for it.’<br><br> ‘For what?’ I says.<br><br> ‘Why, to saw Jim's leg off,’ he says.<br><br> ‘Good land!’ I says; ‘why, there ain't _no_ necessity for it. And what<br> would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?’<br><br> ‘Well, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn't get the<br> chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would<br> be better still. But we got to let that go. There ain't necessity<br> enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't<br> understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so<br> we'll let it go. But there's one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we<br> can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we<br> can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way. And I've et<br> worse pies.’<br><br> ‘Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,’ I says; ‘Jim ain't got no use for a<br> rope ladder.’<br><br> ‘He _has_ got use for it. How _you_ talk, you better say; you don't<br> know nothing about it. He's _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.’<br><br> ‘What in the nation can he _do_ with it?’<br><br> ‘_Do_ with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he?’ That's what they<br> all do; and _he's_ got to, too. Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do<br> anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the<br> time. S'pose he _don't_ do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed,<br> for a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews?<br> Of course they will. And you wouldn't leave them any? That would be a<br> _pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn't_ it! I never heard of such a thing.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ I says, ‘if it's in the regulations, and he's got to have<br> it, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no<br> regulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up<br> our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble<br> with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born. Now, the way I look at<br> it, a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing,<br> and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,<br> as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no<br> experience, and so he don't care what kind of a--’<br><br> ‘Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep<br> still--that's what I'D do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping<br> by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.’<br><br> ‘Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my<br> advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.’<br><br> He said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:<br><br> ‘Borrow a shirt, too.’<br><br> ‘What do we want of a shirt, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.’<br><br> ‘Journal your granny--_Jim_ can't write.’<br><br> ‘S'pose he _can't_ write--he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if<br> we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron<br> barrel-hoop?’<br><br> ‘Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better<br> one; and quicker, too.’<br><br> ‘_Prisoners_ don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull<br> pens out of, you muggins. They _always_ make their pens out of the<br> hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or<br> something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks<br> and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they've got<br> to do it by rubbing it on the wall. _They_ wouldn't use a goose-quill<br> if they had it. It ain't regular.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?’<br><br> ‘Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort<br> and women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that;<br> and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message<br> to let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the<br> bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The<br> Iron Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too.’<br><br> ‘Jim ain't got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.’<br><br> ‘That ain't nothing; we can get him some.’<br><br> ‘Can't nobody _read_ his plates.’<br><br> ‘That ain't got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn. All _he's_ got to<br> do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don't _have_ to be<br> able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner<br> writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?’<br><br> ‘Why, blame it all, it ain't the _prisoner's_ plates.’<br><br> ‘But it's _somebody's_ plates, ain't it?’<br><br> ‘Well, spos'n it is? What does the _prisoner_ care whose--’<br><br> He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we<br> cleared out for the house.<br><br> Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the<br> clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went<br> down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing,<br> because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't<br> borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and<br> prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody<br> don't blame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in a prisoner to<br> steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and<br> so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to<br> steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves<br> out of prison with. He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very<br> different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when<br> he warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was<br> that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,<br> when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he<br> made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it<br> was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we<br> _needed_. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't<br> need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was.<br> He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim<br> to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at<br> that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner<br> if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like<br> that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.<br><br> Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled<br> down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he<br> carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep<br> watch. By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile<br> to talk. He says:<br><br> ‘Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed.’<br><br> ‘Tools?’ I says.<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Tools for what?’<br><br> ‘Why, to dig with. We ain't a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?’<br><br> ‘Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a<br> nigger out with?’ I says.<br><br> He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:<br><br> ‘Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,<br> and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?<br> Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what<br> kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero? Why, they might as<br> well lend him the key and done with it. Picks and shovels--why, they<br> wouldn't furnish 'em to a king.’<br><br> ‘Well, then,’ I says, ‘if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do<br> we want?’<br><br> ‘A couple of case-knives.’<br><br> ‘To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Confound it, it's foolish, Tom.’<br><br> ‘It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the _right_ way--and<br> it's the regular way. And there ain't no _other_ way, that ever I heard<br> of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these<br> things. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind<br> you; generly it's through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks<br> and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in<br> the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that<br> dug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?’<br><br> ‘I don't know.’<br><br> ‘Well, guess.’<br><br> ‘I don't know. A month and a half.’<br><br> ‘_Thirty-seven year_--and he come out in China. _That's_ the kind. I<br> wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.’<br><br> ‘_Jim_ don't know nobody in China.’<br><br> ‘What's _that_ got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But<br> you're always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can't you stick to<br> the main point?’<br><br> ‘All right--I don't care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim<br> don't, either, I reckon. But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to<br> be dug out with a case-knife. He won't last.’<br><br> ‘Yes he will _last_, too. You don't reckon it's going to take<br> thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?’<br><br> ‘How long will it take, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't<br> take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.<br> He'll hear Jim ain't from there. Then his next move will be to<br> advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long<br> digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be<br> a couple of years; but we can't. Things being so uncertain, what I<br> recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can;<br> and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it<br> thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the<br> first time there's an alarm. Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way.’<br><br> ‘Now, there's _sense_ in that,’ I says. ‘Letting on don't cost nothing;<br> letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind<br> letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn't strain<br> me none, after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a<br> couple of case-knives.’<br><br> ‘Smouch three,’ he says; ‘we want one to make a saw out of.’<br><br> ‘Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it,’ I says,<br> ‘there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the<br> weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.’<br><br> He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:<br><br> ‘It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and<br> smouch the knives--three of them.’ So I done it.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVI.<br><br> AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the<br> lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our<br> pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the<br> way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom<br> said he was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and<br> when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there<br> was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the<br> ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.<br> So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then<br> we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see<br> we'd done anything hardly. At last I says:<br><br> ‘This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,<br> Tom Sawyer.’<br><br> He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped<br> digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.<br> Then he says:<br><br> ‘It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. If we was prisoners<br> it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no<br> hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while<br> they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and<br> we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,<br> and the way it ought to be done. But _we_ can't fool along; we got to<br> rush; we ain't got no time to spare. If we was to put in another<br> night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get<br> well--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?’<br><br> ‘I'll tell you. It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like<br> it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way: we got to dig him<br> out with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.’<br><br> ‘_Now_ you're _talking_!’ I says; ‘your head gets leveler and leveler<br> all the time, Tom Sawyer,’ I says. ‘Picks is the thing, moral or no<br> moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.<br> When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school<br> book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done. What I<br> want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my<br> Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing<br> I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school<br> book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks<br> about it nuther.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ he says, ‘there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like<br> this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by<br> and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,<br> and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and<br> knows better. It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,<br> _without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it<br> wouldn't for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.’<br><br> He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and<br> says:<br><br> ‘Gimme a _case-knife_.’<br><br> I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought. I scratched around<br> amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took<br> it and went to work, and never said a word.<br><br> He was always just that particular. Full of principle.<br><br> So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,<br> and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as<br> long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for<br> it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing<br> his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his<br> hands was so sore. At last he says:<br><br> ‘It ain't no use, it can't be done. What you reckon I better do? Can't<br> you think of no way?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ I says, ‘but I reckon it ain't regular. Come up the stairs, and<br> let on it's a lightning-rod.’<br><br> So he done it.<br><br> Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,<br> for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I<br> hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin<br> plates. Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see<br> the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel<br> and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and<br> he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:<br><br> ‘Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.’<br><br> ‘Take them in through the hole,’ I says, ‘when we get it done.’<br><br> He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard<br> of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he<br> said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to<br> decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post Jim first.<br><br> That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took<br> one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard<br> Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we<br> whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half<br> the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and<br> pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,<br> and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle<br> and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us<br> honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us<br> hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,<br> and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how<br> unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,<br> and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and<br> not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.<br> So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old<br> times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told<br> him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt<br> Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and<br> both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:<br><br> ‘_Now_ I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things by them.’<br><br> I said, ‘Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass<br> ideas I ever struck;’ but he never paid no attention to me; went right<br> on. It was his way when he'd got his plans set.<br><br> So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other<br> large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the<br> lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and<br> we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them<br> out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her<br> apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and<br> what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with<br> his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn't see<br> no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed<br> better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just<br> as Tom said.<br><br> Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good<br> sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to<br> bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high<br> spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the<br> most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would<br> keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to<br> get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the<br> more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out<br> to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he<br> said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.<br><br> In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass<br> candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in<br> his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's<br> notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a<br> corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how<br> it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most<br> mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked<br> better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only<br> just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into<br> bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he<br> jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.<br><br> And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a<br> couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on<br> piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room<br> in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to<br> door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered ‘Witches’ once, and keeled<br> over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was<br> dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,<br> and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back<br> again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.<br> Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and<br> asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again. He raised up,<br> and blinked his eyes around, and says:<br><br> ‘Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a<br> million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese<br> tracks. I did, mos' sholy. Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey<br> was all over me. Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht I could git my han's on one<br> er dem witches jis' wunst--on'y jis' wunst--it's all I'd ast. But mos'ly<br> I wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does.’<br><br> Tom says:<br><br> ‘Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at this<br> runaway nigger's breakfast-time? It's because they're hungry; that's<br> the reason. You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for _you_ to<br> do.’<br><br> ‘But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie? I doan'<br> know how to make it. I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, I'll have to make it myself.’<br><br> ‘Will you do it, honey?--will you? I'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot,<br> I will!’<br><br> ‘All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and<br> showed us the runaway nigger. But you got to be mighty careful. When<br> we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put in the<br> pan, don't you let on you see it at all. And don't you look when Jim<br> unloads the pan--something might happen, I don't know what. And above<br> all, don't you _handle_ the witch-things.’<br><br> ‘_Hannel 'M_, Mars Sid? What _is_ you a-talkin' 'bout? I wouldn'<br> lay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion<br> dollars, I wouldn't.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVII.<br><br> THAT was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile<br> in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces<br> of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched<br> around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as<br> we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full<br> of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails<br> that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and<br> sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt<br> Sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuck<br> in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because we<br> heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's<br> house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the<br> pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come<br> yet, so we had to wait a little while.<br><br> And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly<br> wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one<br> hand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the<br> other, and says:<br><br> ‘I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_<br> become of your other shirt.’<br><br> My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard<br> piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the<br> road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the<br> children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry<br> out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around<br> the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for<br> about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out<br> for half price if there was a bidder. But after that we was all right<br> again--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.<br> Uncle Silas he says:<br><br> ‘It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it. I know perfectly<br> well I took it _off_, because--’<br><br> ‘Because you hain't got but one _on_. Just _listen_ at the man! I know<br> you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering<br> memory, too, because it was on the clo's-line yesterday--I see it there<br> myself. But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and you'll<br> just have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to make a<br> new one. And it 'll be the third I've made in two years. It just keeps<br> a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to<br> _do_ with 'm all is more'n I can make out. A body 'd think you _would_<br> learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life.’<br><br> ‘I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn't to be<br> altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have<br> nothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe<br> I've ever lost one of them _off_ of me.’<br><br> ‘Well, it ain't _your_ fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done it<br> if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther.<br> Ther's a spoon gone; and _that_ ain't all. There was ten, and now<br> ther's only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never<br> took the spoon, _that's_ certain.’<br><br> ‘Why, what else is gone, Sally?’<br><br> ‘Ther's six _candles_ gone--that's what. The rats could a got the<br> candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the<br> whole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't<br> do it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas--_you'd_<br> never find it out; but you can't lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I<br> know.’<br><br> ‘Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; but<br> I won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta<br> _Phelps!_’<br><br> Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the<br> sugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps<br> on to the passage, and says:<br><br> ‘Missus, dey's a sheet gone.’<br><br> ‘A _sheet_ gone! Well, for the land's sake!’<br><br> ‘I'll stop up them holes to-day,’ says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.<br><br> ‘Oh, _do_ shet up!--s'pose the rats took the _sheet_? _where's_ it gone,<br> Lize?’<br><br> ‘Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally. She wuz on de<br> clo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain' dah no mo' now.’<br><br> ‘I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end. I _never_ see the beat of it<br> in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--’<br><br> ‘Missus,’ comes a young yaller wench, ‘dey's a brass cannelstick<br> miss'n.’<br><br> ‘Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!’<br><br> Well, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned<br> I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She<br> kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and<br> everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking<br> kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She stopped,<br> with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in<br> Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:<br><br> ‘It's _just_ as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time;<br> and like as not you've got the other things there, too. How'd it get<br> there?’<br><br> ‘I reely don't know, Sally,’ he says, kind of apologizing, ‘or you know<br> I would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before<br> breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put<br> my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but<br> I'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I<br> didn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and<br> took up the spoon, and--’<br><br> ‘Oh, for the land's sake! Give a body a rest! Go 'long now, the whole<br> kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got back my<br> peace of mind.’<br><br> I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking it<br> out; and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead. As we was<br> passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the<br> shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and<br> laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. Tom<br> see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:<br><br> ‘Well, it ain't no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain't<br> reliable.’ Then he says: ‘But he done us a good turn with the spoon,<br> anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without _him_<br> knowing it--stop up his rat-holes.’<br><br> There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole<br> hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we heard<br> steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes<br> the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,<br> looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a mooning around,<br> first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all.<br> Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle<br> and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,<br> saying:<br><br> ‘Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. I could<br> show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats. But never<br> mind--let it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good.’<br><br> And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a<br> mighty nice old man. And always is.<br><br> Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said<br> we'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out<br> he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the<br> spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to<br> counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of<br> them up my sleeve, and Tom says:<br><br> ‘Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.’<br><br> She says:<br><br> ‘Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted<br> 'm myself.’<br><br> ‘Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.’<br><br> She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody<br> would.<br><br> ‘I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!’ she says. ‘Why, what in<br> the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.’<br><br> So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she<br> says:<br><br> ‘Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!’ and she looked huffy<br> and bothered both. But Tom says:<br><br> ‘Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.’<br><br> ‘You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_’<br><br> ‘I know, but--’<br><br> ‘Well, I'll count 'm _again_.’<br><br> So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.<br> Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so<br> mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start<br> to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they<br> come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed<br> up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat<br> galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if<br> we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin<br> us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst<br> she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along<br> with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with<br> this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,<br> because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike<br> again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if<br> she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the<br> next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody<br> that wanted her to ever count them any more.<br><br> So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of<br> her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a<br> couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,<br> and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her<br> soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;<br> she druther die first.<br><br> So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon<br> and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up<br> counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would<br> blow over by and by.<br><br> But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We<br> fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it<br> done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we<br> had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and<br> we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with<br> the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we<br> couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course<br> we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,<br> in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore<br> up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long<br> before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person<br> with. We let on it took nine months to make it.<br><br> And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go<br> into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope<br> enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over<br> for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole<br> dinner.<br><br> But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and<br> so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the<br> wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble<br> brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged<br> to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from<br> England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early<br> ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things<br> that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they<br> warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked<br> her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first<br> pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last<br> one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and<br> loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the<br> lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long<br> handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a<br> pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would<br> want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope<br> ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm<br> talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next<br> time, too.<br><br> Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the<br> three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim<br> got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted<br> into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick,<br> and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the<br> window-hole.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br><br> MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim<br> allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That's the<br> one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had to have<br> it; Tom said he'd _got_ to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not<br> scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.<br><br> ‘Look at Lady Jane Grey,’ he says; ‘look at Gilford Dudley; look at old<br> Northumberland! Why, Huck, s'pose it _is_ considerble trouble?--what<br> you going to do?--how you going to get around it? Jim's _got_ to do his<br> inscription and coat of arms. They all do.’<br><br> Jim says:<br><br> ‘Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish<br> yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ I says, ‘Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat<br> of arms, because he hain't.’<br><br> ‘I reckon I knowed that,’ Tom says, ‘but you bet he'll have one before<br> he goes out of this--because he's going out _right_, and there ain't<br> going to be no flaws in his record.’<br><br> So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim<br> a-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon,<br> Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he'd<br> struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there<br> was one which he reckoned he'd decide on. He says:<br><br> ‘On the scutcheon we'll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire<br> _murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under<br> his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a<br> chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the<br> nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger,<br> _sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a<br> couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore<br> Fretta, Minore Otto._ Got it out of a book--means the more haste the<br> less speed.’<br><br> ‘Geewhillikins,’ I says, ‘but what does the rest of it mean?’<br><br> ‘We ain't got no time to bother over that,’ he says; ‘we got to dig in<br> like all git-out.’<br><br> ‘Well, anyway,’ I says, ‘what's _some_ of it? What's a fess?’<br><br> ‘A fess--a fess is--_you_ don't need to know what a fess is. I'll show<br> him how to make it when he gets to it.’<br><br> ‘Shucks, Tom,’ I says, ‘I think you might tell a person. What's a bar<br> sinister?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I don't know. But he's got to have it. All the nobility does.’<br><br> That was just his way. If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you,<br> he wouldn't do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't make no<br> difference.<br><br> He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to<br> finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a<br> mournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He<br> made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:<br><br> 1. Here a captive heart busted. 2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by<br> the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3. Here a lonely<br> heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven<br> years of solitary captivity. 4. Here, homeless and friendless, after<br> thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,<br> natural son of Louis XIV.<br><br> Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.<br> When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jim<br> to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed<br> he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a<br> year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he<br> didn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block<br> them out for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just<br> follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:<br><br> ‘Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls<br> in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We'll fetch<br> a rock.’<br><br> Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him<br> such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out.<br> But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to<br> see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky<br> tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get<br> well of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom<br> says:<br><br> ‘I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and<br> mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.<br> There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it,<br> and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,<br> too.’<br><br> It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone<br> nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet,<br> so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the<br> grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough<br> job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling<br> over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. Tom said she was<br> going to get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half<br> way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We<br> see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his<br> bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round<br> his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim<br> and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and<br> Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He<br> knowed how to do everything.<br><br> Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone<br> through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom<br> marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,<br> with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the<br> lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle<br> quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under<br> his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his chain back<br> on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. But Tom thought of<br> something, and says:<br><br> ‘You got any spiders in here, Jim?’<br><br> ‘No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom.’<br><br> ‘All right, we'll get you some.’<br><br> ‘But bless you, honey, I doan' _want_ none. I's afeard un um. I jis'<br> 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'.’<br><br> Tom thought a minute or two, and says:<br><br> ‘It's a good idea. And I reckon it's been done. It _must_ a been done;<br> it stands to reason. Yes, it's a prime good idea. Where could you keep<br> it?’<br><br> ‘Keep what, Mars Tom?’<br><br> ‘Why, a rattlesnake.’<br><br> ‘De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to<br> come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid<br> my head.’<br><br> ‘Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little. You could tame<br> it.’<br><br> ‘_Tame_ it!’<br><br> ‘Yes--easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,<br> and they wouldn't _think_ of hurting a person that pets them. Any book<br> will tell you that. You try--that's all I ask; just try for two or three<br> days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he'll love you;<br> and sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let<br> you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.’<br><br> ‘_Please_, Mars Tom--_doan_' talk so! I can't _stan_' it! He'd _let_<br> me shove his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain't it? I lay he'd wait a<br> pow'ful long time 'fo' I _ast_ him. En mo' en dat, I doan' _want_ him<br> to sleep wid me.’<br><br> ‘Jim, don't act so foolish. A prisoner's _got_ to have some kind of a<br> dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more<br> glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other<br> way you could ever think of to save your life.’<br><br> ‘Why, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no sich glory. Snake take 'n bite<br> Jim's chin off, den _whah_ is de glory? No, sah, I doan' want no sich<br> doin's.’<br><br> ‘Blame it, can't you _try_? I only _want_ you to try--you needn't keep<br> it up if it don't work.’<br><br> ‘But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him.<br> Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable,<br> but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's<br> gwyne to _leave_, dat's _shore_.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it.<br> We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on<br> their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have<br> to do.’<br><br> ‘I k'n stan' _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widout<br> um, I tell you dat. I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and<br> trouble to be a prisoner.’<br><br> ‘Well, it _always_ is when it's done right. You got any rats around<br> here?’<br><br> ‘No, sah, I hain't seed none.’<br><br> ‘Well, we'll get you some rats.’<br><br> ‘Why, Mars Tom, I doan' _want_ no rats. Dey's de dadblamedest creturs<br> to 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's<br> tryin' to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's<br> got to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um,<br> skasely.’<br><br> ‘But, Jim, you _got_ to have 'em--they all do. So don't make no more<br> fuss about it. Prisoners ain't ever without rats. There ain't no<br> instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them<br> tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play<br> music to them. You got anything to play music on?’<br><br> ‘I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp;<br> but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp.’<br><br> ‘Yes they would _they_ don't care what kind of music 'tis. A<br> jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music--in a<br> prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can't get no<br> other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out<br> to see what's the matter with you. Yes, you're all right; you're fixed<br> very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep,<br> and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link<br> is Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything<br> else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats,<br> and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you,<br> and come. And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good<br> time.’<br><br> ‘Yes, _dey_ will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_<br> havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I'll do it ef I got to. I<br> reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de<br> house.’<br><br> Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and<br> pretty soon he says:<br><br> ‘Oh, there's one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you<br> reckon?’<br><br> ‘I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah,<br> en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight<br> o' trouble.’<br><br> ‘Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.’<br><br> ‘One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars<br> Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss.’<br><br> ‘Don't you believe it. We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in<br> the corner over there, and raise it. And don't call it mullen, call it<br> Pitchiola--that's its right name when it's in a prison. And you want to<br> water it with your tears.’<br><br> ‘Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.’<br><br> ‘You don't _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.<br> It's the way they always do.’<br><br> ‘Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid<br> spring water whiles another man's a _start'n_ one wid tears.’<br><br> ‘That ain't the idea. You _got_ to do it with tears.’<br><br> ‘She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely<br> ever cry.’<br><br> So Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would<br> have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised<br> he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's<br> coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would ‘jis' 's soon have<br> tobacker in his coffee;’ and found so much fault with it, and with the<br> work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and<br> petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of<br> all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals,<br> and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to<br> be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all<br> patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier<br> chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for<br> himself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was<br> just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't<br> behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIX.<br><br> IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and<br> fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour<br> we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put<br> it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone for<br> spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found<br> it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,<br> and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was<br> a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what<br> they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted<br> us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching<br> another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't<br> the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.<br> I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.<br><br> We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and<br> caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's<br> nest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it right<br> up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd<br> tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we<br> got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right<br> again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes,<br> and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in<br> a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and<br> a rattling good honest day's work: and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!<br> And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't<br> half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn't<br> matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So<br> we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn't no real<br> scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You'd see<br> them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they<br> generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most<br> of the time where you didn't want them. Well, they was handsome and<br> striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never<br> made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what<br> they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and<br> every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference<br> what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I<br> never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You<br> couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if<br> she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a<br> howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old<br> man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes<br> created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the<br> house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't<br> near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could<br> touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump<br> right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all<br> women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or<br> other.<br><br> We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she<br> allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever<br> loaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the lickings,<br> because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we<br> had to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other<br> things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd<br> all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't like the spiders,<br> and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it<br> mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes<br> and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and<br> when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was<br> always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but<br> took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and<br> when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one<br> gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,<br> and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at<br> him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't<br> ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.<br><br> Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.<br> The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he<br> would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;<br> the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the<br> grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,<br> and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all<br> going to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever<br> see; and Tom said the same.<br><br> But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was<br> all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote<br> a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their<br> runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such<br> plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and<br> New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me<br> the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now<br> for the nonnamous letters.<br><br> ‘What's them?’ I says.<br><br> ‘Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one<br> way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that<br> gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going<br> to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. It's a very good<br> way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We'll use them both. And it's<br> usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she<br> stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We'll do that, too.’<br><br> ‘But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that<br> something's up? Let them find it out for themselves--it's their<br> lookout.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted<br> from the very start--left us to do _everything_. They're so confiding<br> and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. So if we<br> don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere<br> with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go<br> off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing--won't be nothing _to_ it.’<br><br> ‘Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.’<br><br> ‘Shucks!’ he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:<br><br> ‘But I ain't going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits<br> me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?’<br><br> ‘You'll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that<br> yaller girl's frock.’<br><br> ‘Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she<br> prob'bly hain't got any but that one.’<br><br> ‘I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the<br> nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.’<br><br> ‘All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my<br> own togs.’<br><br> ‘You wouldn't look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?’<br><br> ‘No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.’<br><br> ‘That ain't got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just<br> to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or<br> not. Hain't you got no principle at all?’<br><br> ‘All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's Jim's<br> mother?’<br><br> ‘I'm his mother. I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.’<br><br> ‘Not much. I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed<br> to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's<br> gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together. When a<br> prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It's always called<br> so when a king escapes, f'rinstance. And the same with a king's son;<br> it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural<br> one.’<br><br> So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's<br> frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the<br> way Tom told me to. It said:<br><br> Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. _Unknown_ _Friend_.<br><br> Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and<br> crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on<br> the back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They couldn't a<br> been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them<br> behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air. If<br> a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said ‘ouch!’ if anything fell,<br> she jumped and said ‘ouch!’ if you happened to touch her, when she<br> warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be<br> satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every<br> time--so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying ‘ouch,’ and<br> before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it<br> again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up. So the<br> thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work<br> more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.<br><br> So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the<br> streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we<br> better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going<br> to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the<br> lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,<br> and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter<br> said:<br><br> Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang of<br> cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway<br> nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will<br> stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang, but have<br> got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and<br> will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,<br> along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the<br> nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn<br> if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as<br> they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his<br> chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your<br> leasure. Don't do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do<br> they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish<br> any reward but to know I have done the right thing. _Unknown Friend._<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XL.<br><br> WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went<br> over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a<br> look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,<br> and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they<br> was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done<br> supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a<br> word about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much<br> about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her<br> back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good<br> lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about<br> half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and<br> was going to start with the lunch, but says:<br><br> ‘Where's the butter?’<br><br> ‘I laid out a hunk of it,’ I says, ‘on a piece of a corn-pone.’<br><br> ‘Well, you _left_ it laid out, then--it ain't here.’<br><br> ‘We can get along without it,’ I says.<br><br> ‘We can get along _with_ it, too,’ he says; ‘just you slide down cellar<br> and fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come<br> along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his<br> mother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as<br> you get there.’<br><br> So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as<br> a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of<br> corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs<br> very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes<br> Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped<br> my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:<br><br> ‘You been down cellar?’<br><br> ‘Yes'm.’<br><br> ‘What you been doing down there?’<br><br> ‘Noth'n.’<br><br> ‘_Noth'n!_’<br><br> ‘No'm.’<br><br> ‘Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?’<br><br> ‘I don't know 'm.’<br><br> ‘You don't _know_? Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what<br> you been _doing_ down there.’<br><br> ‘I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I<br> have.’<br><br> I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I<br> s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat<br> about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,<br> very decided:<br><br> ‘You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You<br> been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it<br> is before I'M done with you.’<br><br> So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.<br> My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them<br> had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.<br> They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,<br> and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't;<br> but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats,<br> and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their<br> seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn't easy myself, but I<br> didn't take my hat off, all the same.<br><br> I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if<br> she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this<br> thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so<br> we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before<br> these rips got out of patience and come for us.<br><br> At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn't_ answer<br> them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men<br> was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and<br> lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to<br> midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the<br> sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and<br> me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was<br> that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter<br> beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty<br> soon, when one of them says, ‘I'M for going and getting in the cabin<br> _first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,’ I most<br> dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and<br> Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:<br><br> ‘For the land's sake, what _is_ the matter with the child? He's got the<br> brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!’<br><br> And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes<br> the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and<br> hugged me, and says:<br><br> ‘Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it<br> ain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours,<br> and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by<br> the color and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear,<br> dear, whyd'nt you _tell_ me that was what you'd been down there for, I<br> wouldn't a cared. Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of<br> you till morning!’<br><br> I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,<br> and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn't hardly get my<br> words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must<br> jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,<br> with guns!<br><br> His eyes just blazed; and he says:<br><br> ‘No!--is that so? _ain't_ it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over<br> again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till--’<br><br> ‘Hurry! _Hurry_!’ I says. ‘Where's Jim?’<br><br> ‘Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.<br> He's dressed, and everything's ready. Now we'll slide out and give the<br> sheep-signal.’<br><br> But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them<br> begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:<br><br> ‘I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.<br> Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the<br> dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,<br> and listen if you can hear 'em coming.’<br><br> So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on<br> us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all<br> right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,<br> and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the<br> lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the door,<br> and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make<br> out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen<br> for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out<br> first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and<br> listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all<br> the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,<br> not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy<br> towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim<br> over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top<br> rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which<br> snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks<br> and started somebody sings out:<br><br> ‘Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!’<br><br> But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there<br> was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed<br> around us! We heard them sing out:<br><br> ‘Here they are! They've broke for the river! After 'em, boys, and turn<br> loose the dogs!’<br><br> So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore<br> boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. We was<br> in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we<br> dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind<br> them. They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the<br> robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they<br> come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we<br> stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't<br> nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said<br> howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and<br> then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly<br> to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was<br> tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the<br> river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we<br> struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and<br> we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the<br> bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when<br> we stepped on to the raft I says:<br><br> ‘_Now_, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a<br> slave no more.’<br><br> ‘En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It 'uz planned beautiful, en<br> it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat's mo'<br> mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.’<br><br> We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because<br> he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.<br><br> When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did<br> before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in<br> the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but<br> he says:<br><br> ‘Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don't stop now; don't fool around<br> here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set<br> her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!--'deed we did. I wish _we'd_ a<br> had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint<br> Louis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we'd<br> a whooped him over the _border_--that's what we'd a done with _him_--and<br> done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps--man the<br> sweeps!’<br><br> But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking. And after we'd thought a<br> minute, I says:<br><br> ‘Say it, Jim.’<br><br> So he says:<br><br> ‘Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz _him_ dat 'uz<br> bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on<br> en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?' Is dat like<br> Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You _bet_ he wouldn't! _well_,<br> den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it? No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n dis<br> place 'dout a _doctor_, not if it's forty year!’<br><br> I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say--so<br> it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.<br> He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and<br> wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose<br> himself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind,<br> but it didn't do no good.<br><br> So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:<br><br> ‘Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you<br> get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and<br> fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse<br> full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the<br> back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the<br> canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take<br> his chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him<br> back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it<br> again. It's the way they all do.’<br><br> So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he<br> see the doctor coming till he was gone again.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XLI.<br><br> THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got<br> him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting<br> yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about<br> midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and<br> shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and<br> not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to<br> come home this evening and surprise the folks.<br><br> ‘Who is your folks?’ he says.<br><br> ‘The Phelpses, down yonder.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ he says. And after a minute, he says:<br><br> ‘How'd you say he got shot?’<br><br> ‘He had a dream,’ I says, ‘and it shot him.’<br><br> ‘Singular dream,’ he says.<br><br> So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But<br> when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big<br> enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says:<br><br> ‘Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy<br> enough.’<br><br> ‘What three?’<br><br> ‘Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that's what I mean.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ he says.<br><br> But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,<br> and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was<br> all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait<br> till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better<br> go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But<br> I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he<br> started.<br><br> I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix<br> that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?<br> spos'n it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?--lay<br> around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know what<br> _I'll_ do. I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to<br> go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie<br> him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done<br> with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him<br> get ashore.<br><br> So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I<br> waked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the<br> doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time<br> or other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad<br> for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved,<br> and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's<br> stomach! He says:<br><br> ‘Why, _Tom!_ Where you been all this time, you rascal?’<br><br> ‘I hain't been nowheres,’ I says, ‘only just hunting for the runaway<br> nigger--me and Sid.’<br><br> ‘Why, where ever did you go?’ he says. ‘Your aunt's been mighty<br> uneasy.’<br><br> ‘She needn't,’ I says, ‘because we was all right. We followed the men<br> and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we<br> heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and<br> crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along<br> up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe<br> and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we<br> paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see<br> what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for<br> us, and then we're going home.’<br><br> So then we went to the post-office to get ‘Sid’; but just as I<br> suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the<br> office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man<br> said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done<br> fooling around--but we would ride. I couldn't get him to let me stay<br> and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come<br> along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.<br><br> When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and<br> cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that<br> don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.<br><br> And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner;<br> and such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the<br> worst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She says:<br><br> ‘Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve<br> the nigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell--didn't I, Sister<br> Damrell?--s'I, he's crazy, s'I--them's the very words I said. You all<br> hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I. Look at that-air<br> grindstone, s'I; want to tell _me_'t any cretur 't's in his right mind<br> 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I?<br> Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' so<br> pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that--natcherl son o' Louis<br> somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage. He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what<br> I says in the fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what<br> I says last 'n' all the time--the nigger's crazy--crazy 's Nebokoodneezer,<br> s'I.’<br><br> ‘An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,’ says<br> old Mrs. Damrell; ‘what in the name o' goodness _could_ he ever want<br> of--’<br><br> ‘The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister<br> Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself. Sh-she, look at that-air rag<br> ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, _look_ at it, s'I--what _could_ he a-wanted<br> of it, s'I. Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--’<br><br> ‘But how in the nation'd they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,<br> _anyway_? 'n' who dug that-air _hole_? 'n' who--’<br><br> ‘My very _words_, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin'--pass that-air sasser o'<br> m'lasses, won't ye?--I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,<br> how _did_ they git that grindstone in there, s'I. Without _help_, mind<br> you--'thout _help_! _that's_ wher 'tis. Don't tell _me_, s'I; there<br> _wuz_ help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s'I; ther's ben a<br> _dozen_ a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on<br> this place but _I'd_ find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I--’<br><br> ‘A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn't a done every thing that's been<br> done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been<br> made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men;<br> look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at--’<br><br> ‘You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower! It's jist as I was a-sayin'<br> to Brer Phelps, his own self. S'e, what do _you_ think of it, Sister<br> Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I? Think o' that bed-leg<br> sawed off that a way, s'e? _think_ of it, s'I? I lay it never sawed<br> _itself_ off, s'I--somebody _sawed_ it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it<br> or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my<br> opinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him _do_<br> it, s'I, that's all. I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I--’<br><br> ‘Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there<br> every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps. Look<br> at that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African<br> writ'n done with blood! Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all<br> the time, amost. Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n'<br> as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll--’<br><br> ‘People to _help_ him, Brother Marples! Well, I reckon you'd _think_<br> so if you'd a been in this house for a while back. Why, they've stole<br> everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,<br> mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that<br> sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how<br> many times they _didn't_ steal that; and flour, and candles, and<br> candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand<br> things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and<br> Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was<br> a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight<br> nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they<br> slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_<br> but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that<br> nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs<br> right on their very heels at that very time! I tell you, it just bangs<br> anything I ever _heard_ of. Why, _sperits_ couldn't a done better and<br> been no smarter. And I reckon they must a _been_ sperits--because, _you_<br> know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got<br> on the _track_ of 'm once! You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_<br> of you!’<br><br> ‘Well, it does beat--’<br><br> ‘Laws alive, I never--’<br><br> ‘So help me, I wouldn't a be--’<br><br> ‘_House_-thieves as well as--’<br><br> ‘Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a--’<br><br> ‘'Fraid to _live_!--why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, or<br> get up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they'd steal<br> the very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was<br> in by the time midnight come last night. I hope to gracious if I warn't<br> afraid they'd steal some o' the family! I was just to that pass I<br> didn't have no reasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough<br> _now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys<br> asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness<br> I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in! I _did_. And<br> anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it<br> keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your<br> wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things,<br> and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up<br> there, and the door ain't locked, and you--’ She stopped, looking kind<br> of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye<br> lit on me--I got up and took a walk.<br><br> Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that<br> room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.<br> So I done it. But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me. And when<br> it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and<br> told her the noise and shooting waked up me and ‘Sid,’ and the door was<br> locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod,<br> and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try _that_<br> no more. And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas<br> before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right<br> enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys<br> was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long<br> as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time<br> being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of<br> fretting over what was past and done. So then she kissed me, and patted<br> me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty<br> soon jumps up, and says:<br><br> ‘Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet! What _has_<br> become of that boy?’<br><br> I see my chance; so I skips up and says:<br><br> ‘I'll run right up to town and get him,’ I says.<br><br> ‘No you won't,’ she says. ‘You'll stay right wher' you are; _one's_<br> enough to be lost at a time. If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll<br> go.’<br><br> Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.<br><br> He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's<br> track. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said<br> there warn't no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'll<br> see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. So she had<br> to be satisfied. But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and<br> keep a light burning so he could see it.<br><br> And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her<br> candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like<br> I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked<br> with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't<br> seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every<br> now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe<br> drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or<br> dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down<br> silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home<br> in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,<br> and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her<br> good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she was going away she<br> looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:<br><br> ‘The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and<br> the rod; but you'll be good, _won't_ you? And you won't go? For _my_<br> sake.’<br><br> Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all<br> intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.<br><br> But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.<br> And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around<br> front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her<br> eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do<br> something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never<br> do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I waked up at<br> dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,<br> and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XLII.<br><br> THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no<br> track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying<br> nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not<br> eating anything. And by and by the old man says:<br><br> ‘Did I give you the letter?’<br><br> ‘What letter?’<br><br> ‘The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.’<br><br> ‘No, you didn't give me no letter.’<br><br> ‘Well, I must a forgot it.’<br><br> So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had<br> laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:<br><br> ‘Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.’<br><br> I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But<br> before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see<br> something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old<br> doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;<br> and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come<br> handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:<br><br> ‘Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!’<br><br> And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,<br> which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,<br> and says:<br><br> ‘He's alive, thank God! And that's enough!’ and she snatched a kiss of<br> him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders<br> right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue<br> could go, every jump of the way.<br><br> I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the<br> old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men<br> was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to<br> all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run<br> away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a<br> whole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others<br> said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and<br> his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled<br> them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious<br> for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very<br> ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their<br> satisfaction out of him.<br><br> They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the<br> head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to<br> know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes<br> on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to<br> a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and<br> both legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to<br> eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because<br> he didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and<br> said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the<br> cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and<br> about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with<br> a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and<br> takes a look, and says:<br><br> ‘Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't<br> a bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut<br> the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for<br> me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little<br> worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let<br> me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill<br> me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do<br> anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and<br> the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says<br> he'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I<br> judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_! and there I had<br> to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It<br> was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and<br> of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,<br> because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet<br> never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick<br> plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a<br> better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,<br> and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked<br> main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a<br> nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too. I<br> had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he<br> would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I<br> _was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about<br> dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck<br> would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped<br> on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped<br> up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was<br> about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a<br> flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and<br> towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least<br> row nor said a word from the start. He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen;<br> that's what I think about him.’<br><br> Somebody says:<br><br> ‘Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.’<br><br> Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful<br> to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was<br> according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good<br> heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they<br> all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some<br> notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out<br> and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.<br><br> Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he<br> could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten<br> heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they<br> didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but<br> I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as<br> soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of<br> me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot<br> when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling<br> around hunting the runaway nigger.<br><br> But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day<br> and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged<br> him.<br><br> Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt<br> Sally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I<br> found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that<br> would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and<br> pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and<br> laid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding<br> in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and<br> set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful<br> now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping<br> like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the<br> time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.<br><br> So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his<br> eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:<br><br> ‘Hello!--why, I'm at _home_! How's that? Where's the raft?’<br><br> ‘It's all right,’ I says.<br><br> ‘And _Jim_?’<br><br> ‘The same,’ I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never<br> noticed, but says:<br><br> ‘Good! Splendid! _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?’<br><br> I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: ‘About what, Sid?’<br><br> ‘Why, about the way the whole thing was done.’<br><br> ‘What whole thing?’<br><br> ‘Why, _the_ whole thing. There ain't but one; how we set the runaway<br> nigger free--me and Tom.’<br><br> ‘Good land! Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about! Dear, dear,<br> out of his head again!’<br><br> ‘_No_, I ain't out of my _head_; I know all what I'm talking about. We<br> _did_ set him free--me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.<br> And we done it elegant, too.’ He'd got a start, and she never checked<br> him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and<br> I see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in. ‘Why, Aunty, it cost us a<br> power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was<br> all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,<br> and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the<br> warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,<br> and you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and<br> inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think _half_ the<br> fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,<br> and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the<br> lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder<br> and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work<br> with in your apron pocket--’<br><br> ‘Mercy sakes!’<br><br> ‘--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for<br> Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that<br> you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before<br> we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let<br> drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let<br> them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but<br> went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the<br> raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by<br> ourselves, and _wasn't_ it bully, Aunty!’<br><br> ‘Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was<br> _you_, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble,<br> and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to<br> death. I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out<br> o' you this very minute. To think, here I've been, night after night,<br> a--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old<br> Harry out o' both o' ye!’<br><br> But Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn't_ hold in,<br> and his tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all<br> along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she<br> says:<br><br> ‘_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I<br> tell you if I catch you meddling with him again--’<br><br> ‘Meddling with _who_?’ Tom says, dropping his smile and looking<br> surprised.<br><br> ‘With _who_? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd you reckon?’<br><br> Tom looks at me very grave, and says:<br><br> ‘Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? Hasn't he got away?’<br><br> ‘_Him_?’ says Aunt Sally; ‘the runaway nigger? 'Deed he hasn't.<br> They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again,<br> on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or<br> sold!’<br><br> Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening<br> and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:<br><br> ‘They hain't no _right_ to shut him up! SHOVE!--and don't you lose a<br> minute. Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur<br> that walks this earth!’<br><br> ‘What _does_ the child mean?’<br><br> ‘I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, _I'll_<br> go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss<br> Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to<br> sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her<br> will.’<br><br> ‘Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was<br> already free?’<br><br> ‘Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women! Why,<br> I wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood<br> to--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!_’<br><br> If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as<br> sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!<br><br> Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and<br> cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,<br> for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped<br> out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and<br> stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding<br> him into the earth, you know. And then she says:<br><br> ‘Yes, you _better_ turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Oh, deary me!’ says Aunt Sally; ‘_Is_ he changed so? Why, that ain't<br> _Tom_, it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's--why, where is Tom? He was here a minute<br> ago.’<br><br> ‘You mean where's Huck _Finn_--that's what you mean! I reckon I hain't<br> raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I<br> _see_ him. That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that<br> bed, Huck Finn.’<br><br> So I done it. But not feeling brash.<br><br> Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever<br> see--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told<br> it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't<br> know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting<br> sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the<br> oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's Aunt Polly,<br> she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how<br> I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom<br> Sawyer--she chipped in and says, ‘Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm<br> used to it now, and 'tain't no need to change’--that when Aunt Sally took<br> me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and<br> I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being<br> a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly<br> satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made<br> things as soft as he could for me.<br><br> And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting<br> Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took<br> all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't<br> ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_<br> help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.<br><br> Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and<br> _Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:<br><br> ‘Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that<br> way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all<br> the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that<br> creetur's up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any<br> answer out of you about it.’<br><br> ‘Why, I never heard nothing from you,’ says Aunt Sally.<br><br> ‘Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean<br> by Sid being here.’<br><br> ‘Well, I never got 'em, Sis.’<br><br> Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:<br><br> ‘You, Tom!’<br><br> ‘Well--_what_?’ he says, kind of pettish.<br><br> ‘Don't you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.’<br><br> ‘What letters?’<br><br> ‘_Them_ letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll--’<br><br> ‘They're in the trunk. There, now. And they're just the same as they<br> was when I got them out of the office. I hain't looked into them, I<br> hain't touched them. But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if<br> you warn't in no hurry, I'd--’<br><br> ‘Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it. And I<br> wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he--’<br><br> ‘No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but _it's_ all right, I've<br> got that one.’<br><br> I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it<br> was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER THE LAST<br><br> THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time<br> of the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all<br> right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?<br> And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got<br> Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and<br> have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about<br> his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,<br> and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all<br> the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight<br> procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would<br> we. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.<br><br> We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle<br> Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,<br> they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him<br> all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had<br> him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty<br> dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,<br> and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:<br><br> ‘Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson<br> islan'? I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en<br> I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it's<br> come true; en heah she is! _dah_, now! doan' talk to _me_--signs is<br> _signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be<br> rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!’<br><br> And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three<br> slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for<br> howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a<br> couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I<br> ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get<br> none from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got<br> it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.<br><br> ‘No, he hain't,’ Tom says; ‘it's all there yet--six thousand dollars<br> and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since. Hadn't when I come<br> away, anyhow.’<br><br> Jim says, kind of solemn:<br><br> ‘He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck.’<br><br> I says:<br><br> ‘Why, Jim?’<br><br> ‘Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain't comin' back no mo.’<br><br> But I kept at him; so at last he says:<br><br> ‘Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a<br> man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you<br> come in? Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat<br> wuz him.’<br><br> Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard<br> for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't<br> nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd<br> a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it,<br> and ain't a-going to no more. But I reckon I got to light out for the<br> Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me<br> and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.<br><br> THE END. YOURS TRULY, HUCK FINN.</p>"}
