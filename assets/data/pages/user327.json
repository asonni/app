Hardly are those words out<br> When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br> Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br> A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br> A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, <br> Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br> Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br> The darkness drops again; but now I know<br> That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br> Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br> And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br> Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"
