I wonder if<br>Anyone looked at me, forty years back,<br>And thought, That'll be the life;<br>No God any more, or sweating in the dark<br><br>About hell and that, or having to hide<br>What you think of the priest. He<br>And his lot will all go down the long slide<br>Like free bloody birds. And immediately<br><br>Rather than words comes the thought of high windows:<br>The sun-comprehending glass,<br>And beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows<br>Nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless."
