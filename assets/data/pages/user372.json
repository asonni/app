				"main_text": "When will you ever, Peace, wild wooddove, shy wings shut,<br> Your round me roaming end, and under be my boughs?<br> When, when, Peace, will you, Peace? I'll not play hypocrite<br> To own my heart: I yield you do come sometimes; but<br> That piecemeal peace is poor peace. What pure peace allows<br> Alarms of wars, the daunting wars, the death of it? <br> <br> O surely, reaving Peace, my Lord should leave in lieu<br> Some good! And so he does leave Patience exquisite,<br> That plumes to Peace thereafter. And when Peace here does house<br> He comes with work to do, he does not come to coo,<br> He comes to brood and sit."
