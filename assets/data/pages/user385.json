				"main_text": "She died in the upstairs bedroom<br> By the light of the ev'ning star<br> That shone through the plate glass window<br> From over Leamington Spa<br><br> Beside her the lonely crochet<br> Lay patiently and unstirred,<br> But the fingers that would have work'd it<br> Were dead as the spoken word.<br><br> And Nurse came in with the tea-things<br> Breast high 'mid the stands and chairs-<br> But Nurse was alone with her own little soul,<br> And the things were alone with theirs.<br><br> She bolted the big round window,<br> She let the blinds unroll,<br> She set a match to the mantle,<br> She covered the fire with coal.<br><br> And 'Tea!' she said in a tiny voice<br> 'Wake up! It's nearly five'<br> Oh! Chintzy, chintzy cheeriness,<br> Half dead and half alive.<br><br> Do you know that the stucco is peeling?<br> Do you know that the heart will stop?<br> From those yellow Italianate arches<br> Do you hear the plaster drop?<br><br> Nurse looked at the silent bedstead,<br> At the gray, decaying face,<br> As the calm of a Leamington ev'ning<br> Drifted into the place.<br><br> She moved the table of bottles<br> Away from the bed to the wall<br> And tiptoeing gently over the stairs<br> Turned down the gas in the hall."
