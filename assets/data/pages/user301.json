If they are later made<br>Scandal and index to their time,<br>It is that twilight brings for bread<br>The faculty of crime.<br>Only the idiot and the dead<br>Stand by, while who were young before<br>Wage insolent and guilty war<br>By night within that ancient house,<br>Immense, black, damned, anonymous."
