"main_text":"PART ONE<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER I<br><br> <br> Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when<br> caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. In her face were<br> too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast<br> aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid<br> Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,<br> square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel,<br> starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends.<br> Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a<br> startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin--that skin so<br> prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets,<br> veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.<br><br> Seated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the<br> porch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright April<br> afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green<br> flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing<br> material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green<br> morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta.<br> The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the<br> smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed<br> breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the<br> modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted<br> smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands<br> folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green<br> eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty<br> with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor.<br> Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle<br> admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were<br> her own.<br><br> On either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs,<br> squinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as<br> they laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and<br> thick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years<br> old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle,<br> with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and<br> arrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and<br> mustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of<br> cotton.<br><br> Outside, the late afternoon sun slanted down in the yard, throwing<br> into gleaming brightness the dogwood trees that were solid masses<br> of white blossoms against the background of new green. The twins'<br> horses were hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their<br> masters' hair; and around the horses' legs quarreled the pack of<br> lean, nervous possum hounds that accompanied Stuart and Brent<br> wherever they went. A little aloof, as became an aristocrat, lay<br> a black-spotted carriage dog, muzzle on paws, patiently waiting<br> for the boys to go home to supper.<br><br> Between the hounds and the horses and the twins there was a<br> kinship deeper than that of their constant companionship. They<br> were all healthy, thoughtless young animals, sleek, graceful,<br> high-spirited, the boys as mettlesome as the horses they rode,<br> mettlesome and dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who<br> knew how to handle them.<br><br> Although born to the ease of plantation life, waited on hand and<br> foot since infancy, the faces of the three on the porch were<br> neither slack nor soft. They had the vigor and alertness of<br> country people who have spent all their lives in the open and<br> troubled their heads very little with dull things in books. Life<br> in the north Georgia county of Clayton was still new and,<br> according to the standards of Augusta, Savannah and Charleston, a<br> little crude. The more sedate and older sections of the South<br> looked down their noses at the up-country Georgians, but here in<br> north Georgia, a lack of the niceties of classical education<br> carried no shame, provided a man was smart in the things that<br> mattered. And raising good cotton, riding well, shooting<br> straight, dancing lightly, squiring the ladies with elegance and<br> carrying one's liquor like a gentleman were the things that<br> mattered.<br><br> In these accomplishments the twins excelled, and they were equally<br> outstanding in their notorious inability to learn anything<br> contained between the covers of books. Their family had more<br> money, more horses, more slaves than any one else in the County,<br> but the boys had less grammar than most of their poor Cracker<br> neighbors.<br><br> It was for this precise reason that Stuart and Brent were idling<br> on the porch of Tara this April afternoon. They had just been<br> expelled from the University of Georgia, the fourth university<br> that had thrown them out in two years; and their older brothers,<br> Tom and Boyd, had come home with them, because they refused to<br> remain at an institution where the twins were not welcome. Stuart<br> and Brent considered their latest expulsion a fine joke, and<br> Scarlett, who had not willingly opened a book since leaving the<br> Fayetteville Female Academy the year before, thought it just as<br> amusing as they did.<br><br> ‘I know you two don't care about being expelled, or Tom either,’<br> she said. ‘But what about Boyd? He's kind of set on getting an<br> education, and you two have pulled him out of the University of<br> Virginia and Alabama and South Carolina and now Georgia. He'll<br> never get finished at this rate.’<br><br> ‘Oh, he can read law in Judge Parmalee's office over in<br> Fayetteville,’ answered Brent carelessly. ‘Besides, it don't<br> matter much. We'd have had to come home before the term was out<br> anyway.’<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘The war, goose! The war's going to start any day, and you don't<br> suppose any of us would stay in college with a war going on, do<br> you?’<br><br> ‘You know there isn't going to be any war,’ said Scarlett, bored.<br> ‘It's all just talk. Why, Ashley Wilkes and his father told Pa<br> just last week that our commissioners in Washington would come<br> to--to--an--amicable agreement with Mr. Lincoln about the<br> Confederacy. And anyway, the Yankees are too scared of us to<br> fight. There won't be any war, and I'm tired of hearing about<br> it.’<br><br> ‘Not going to be any war!’ cried the twins indignantly, as though<br> they had been defrauded.<br><br> ‘Why, honey, of course there's going to be a war,’ said Stuart.<br> ‘The Yankees may be scared of us, but after the way General<br> Beauregard shelled them out of Fort Sumter day before yesterday,<br> they'll have to fight or stand branded as cowards before the whole<br> world. Why, the Confederacy--’<br><br> Scarlett made a mouth of bored impatience.<br><br> ‘If you say 'war' just once more, I'll go in the house and shut<br> the door. I've never gotten so tired of any one word in my life<br> as 'war,' unless it's 'secession.' Pa talks war morning, noon and<br> night, and all the gentlemen who come to see him shout about Fort<br> Sumter and States' Rights and Abe Lincoln till I get so bored I<br> could scream! And that's all the boys talk about, too, that and<br> their old Troop. There hasn't been any fun at any party this<br> spring because the boys can't talk about anything else. I'm<br> mighty glad Georgia waited till after Christmas before it seceded<br> or it would have ruined the Christmas parties, too. If you say<br> 'war' again, I'll go in the house.’<br><br> She meant what she said, for she could never long endure any<br> conversation of which she was not the chief subject. But she<br> smiled when she spoke, consciously deepening her dimple and<br> fluttering her bristly black lashes as swiftly as butterflies'<br> wings. The boys were enchanted, as she had intended them to be,<br> and they hastened to apologize for boring her. They thought none<br> the less of her for her lack of interest. Indeed, they thought<br> more. War was men's business, not ladies', and they took her<br> attitude as evidence of her femininity.<br><br> Having maneuvered them away from the boring subject of war, she<br> went back with interest to their immediate situation.<br><br> ‘What did your mother say about you two being expelled again?’<br><br> The boys looked uncomfortable, recalling their mother's conduct<br> three months ago when they had come home, by request, from the<br> University of Virginia.<br><br> ‘Well,’ said Stuart, ‘she hasn't had a chance to say anything yet.<br> Tom and us left home early this morning before she got up, and<br> Tom's laying out over at the Fontaines' while we came over here.’<br><br> ‘Didn't she say anything when you got home last night?’<br><br> ‘We were in luck last night. Just before we got home that new<br> stallion Ma got in Kentucky last month was brought in, and the<br> place was in a stew. The big brute--he's a grand horse, Scarlett;<br> you must tell your pa to come over and see him right away--he'd<br> already bitten a hunk out of his groom on the way down here and<br> he'd trampled two of Ma's darkies who met the train at Jonesboro.<br> And just before we got home, he'd about kicked the stable down and<br> half-killed Strawberry, Ma's old stallion. When we got home, Ma<br> was out in the stable with a sackful of sugar smoothing him down<br> and doing it mighty well, too. The darkies were hanging from the<br> rafters, popeyed, they were so scared, but Ma was talking to the<br> horse like he was folks and he was eating out of her hand. There<br> ain't nobody like Ma with a horse. And when she saw us she said:<br> 'In Heaven's name, what are you four doing home again? You're<br> worse than the plagues of Egypt!' And then the horse began<br> snorting and rearing and she said: 'Get out of here! Can't you<br> see he's nervous, the big darling? I'll tend to you four in the<br> morning!' So we went to bed, and this morning we got away before<br> she could catch us and left Boyd to handle her.’<br><br> ‘Do you suppose she'll hit Boyd?’ Scarlett, like the rest of the<br> County, could never get used to the way small Mrs. Tarleton<br> bullied her grown sons and laid her riding crop on their backs if<br> the occasion seemed to warrant it.<br><br> Beatrice Tarleton was a busy woman, having on her hands not only a<br> large cotton plantation, a hundred negroes and eight children, but<br> the largest horse-breeding farm in the state as well. She was<br> hot-tempered and easily plagued by the frequent scrapes of her<br> four sons, and while no one was permitted to whip a horse or a<br> slave, she felt that a lick now and then didn't do the boys any<br> harm.<br><br> ‘Of course she won't hit Boyd. She never did beat Boyd much<br> because he's the oldest and besides he's the runt of the litter,’<br> said Stuart, proud of his six feet two. ‘That's why we left him<br> at home to explain things to her. God'lmighty, Ma ought to stop<br> licking us! We're nineteen and Tom's twenty-one, and she acts<br> like we're six years old.’<br><br> ‘Will your mother ride the new horse to the Wilkes barbecue<br> tomorrow?’<br><br> ‘She wants to, but Pa says he's too dangerous. And, anyway, the<br> girls won't let her. They said they were going to have her go to<br> one party at least like a lady, riding in the carriage.’<br><br> ‘I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow,’ said Scarlett. ‘It's rained<br> nearly every day for a week. There's nothing worse than a<br> barbecue turned into an indoor picnic.’<br><br> ‘Oh, it'll be clear tomorrow and hot as June,’ said Stuart.<br> ‘Look at that sunset. I never saw one redder. You can always<br> tell weather by sunsets.’<br><br> They looked out across the endless acres of Gerald O'Hara's newly<br> plowed cotton fields toward the red horizon. Now that the sun was<br> setting in a welter of crimson behind the hills across the Flint<br> River, the warmth of the April day was ebbing into a faint but<br> balmy chill.<br><br> Spring had come early that year, with warm quick rains and sudden<br> frothing of pink peach blossoms and dogwood dappling with white<br> stars the dark river swamp and far-off hills. Already the plowing<br> was nearly finished, and the bloody glory of the sunset colored<br> the fresh-cut furrows of red Georgia clay to even redder hues.<br> The moist hungry earth, waiting upturned for the cotton seeds,<br> showed pinkish on the sandy tops of furrows, vermilion and scarlet<br> and maroon where shadows lay along the sides of the trenches. The<br> whitewashed brick plantation house seemed an island set in a wild<br> red sea, a sea of spiraling, curving, crescent billows petrified<br> suddenly at the moment when the pink-tipped waves were breaking<br> into surf. For here were no long, straight furrows, such as could<br> be seen in the yellow clay fields of the flat middle Georgia<br> country or in the lush black earth of the coastal plantations.<br> The rolling foothill country of north Georgia was plowed in a<br> million curves to keep the rich earth from washing down into the<br> river bottoms.<br><br> It was a savagely red land, blood-colored after rains, brick dust<br> in droughts, the best cotton land in the world. It was a pleasant<br> land of white houses, peaceful plowed fields and sluggish yellow<br> rivers, but a land of contrasts, of brightest sun glare and<br> densest shade. The plantation clearings and miles of cotton<br> fields smiled up to a warm sun, placid, complacent. At their<br> edges rose the virgin forests, dark and cool even in the hottest<br> noons, mysterious, a little sinister, the soughing pines seeming<br> to wait with an age-old patience, to threaten with soft sighs:<br> ‘Be careful! Be careful! We had you once. We can take you back<br> again.’<br><br> To the ears of the three on the porch came the sounds of hooves,<br> the jingling of harness chains and the shrill careless laughter<br> of negro voices, as the field hands and mules came in from the<br> fields. From within the house floated the soft voice of<br> Scarlett's mother, Ellen O'Hara, as she called to the little black<br> girl who carried her basket of keys. The high-pitched, childish<br> voice answered ‘Yas'm,’ and there were sounds of footsteps going<br> out the back way toward the smokehouse where Ellen would ration<br> out the food to the home-coming hands. There was the click of<br> china and the rattle of silver as Pork, the valet-butler of Tara,<br> laid the table for supper.<br><br> At these last sounds, the twins realized it was time they were<br> starting home. But they were loath to face their mother and they<br> lingered on the porch of Tara, momentarily expecting Scarlett to<br> give them an invitation to supper.<br><br> ‘Look, Scarlett. About tomorrow,’ said Brent. ‘Just because<br> we've been away and didn't know about the barbecue and the ball,<br> that's no reason why we shouldn't get plenty of dances tomorrow<br> night. You haven't promised them all, have you?’<br><br> ‘Well, I have! How did I know you all would be home? I couldn't<br> risk being a wallflower just waiting on you two.’<br><br> ‘You a wallflower!’ The boys laughed uproariously.<br><br> ‘Look, honey. You've got to give me the first waltz and Stu the<br> last one and you've got to eat supper with us. We'll sit on the<br> stair landing like we did at the last ball and get Mammy Jincy to<br> come tell our fortunes again.’<br><br> ‘I don't like Mammy Jincy's fortunes. You know she said I was<br> going to marry a gentleman with jet-black hair and a long black<br> mustache, and I don't like black-haired gentlemen.’<br><br> ‘You like 'em red-headed, don't you, honey?’ grinned Brent. ‘Now,<br> come on, promise us all the waltzes and the supper.’<br><br> ‘If you'll promise, we'll tell you a secret,’ said Stuart.<br><br> ‘What?’ cried Scarlett, alert as a child at the word.<br><br> ‘Is it what we heard yesterday in Atlanta, Stu? If it is, you<br> know we promised not to tell.’<br><br> ‘Well, Miss Pitty told us.’<br><br> ‘Miss Who?’<br><br> ‘You know, Ashley Wilkes' cousin who lives in Atlanta, Miss<br> Pittypat Hamilton--Charles and Melanie Hamilton's aunt.’<br><br> ‘I do, and a sillier old lady I never met in all my life.’<br><br> ‘Well, when we were in Atlanta yesterday, waiting for the home<br> train, her carriage went by the depot and she stopped and talked<br> to us, and she told us there was going to be an engagement<br> announced tomorrow night at the Wilkes ball.’<br><br> ‘Oh. I know about that,’ said Scarlett in disappointment. ‘That<br> silly nephew of hers, Charlie Hamilton, and Honey Wilkes.<br> Everybody's known for years that they'd get married some time,<br> even if he did seem kind of lukewarm about it.’<br><br> ‘Do you think he's silly?’ questioned Brent. ‘Last Christmas you<br> sure let him buzz round you plenty.’<br><br> ‘I couldn't help him buzzing,’ Scarlett shrugged negligently. ‘I<br> think he's an awful sissy.’<br><br> ‘Besides, it isn't his engagement that's going to be announced,’<br> said Stuart triumphantly. ‘It's Ashley's to Charlie's sister,<br> Miss Melanie!’<br><br> Scarlett's face did not change but her lips went white--like a<br> person who has received a stunning blow without warning and who,<br> in the first moments of shock, does not realize what has happened.<br> So still was her face as she stared at Stuart that he, never<br> analytic, took it for granted that she was merely surprised and<br> very interested.<br><br> ‘Miss Pitty told us they hadn't intended announcing it till next<br> year, because Miss Melly hasn't been very well; but with all the<br> war talk going around, everybody in both families thought it would<br> be better to get married soon. So it's to be announced tomorrow<br> night at the supper intermission. Now, Scarlett, we've told you<br> the secret, so you've got to promise to eat supper with us.’<br><br> ‘Of course I will,’ Scarlett said automatically.<br><br> ‘And all the waltzes?’<br><br> ‘All.’<br><br> ‘You're sweet! I'll bet the other boys will be hopping mad.’<br><br> ‘Let 'em be mad,’ said Brent. ‘We two can handle 'em. Look,<br> Scarlett. Sit with us at the barbecue in the morning.’<br><br> ‘What?’<br><br> Stuart repeated his request.<br><br> ‘Of course.’<br><br> The twins looked at each other jubilantly but with some surprise.<br> Although they considered themselves Scarlett's favored suitors,<br> they had never before gained tokens of this favor so easily.<br> Usually she made them beg and plead, while she put them off,<br> refusing to give a Yes or No answer, laughing if they sulked,<br> growing cool if they became angry. And here she had practically<br> promised them the whole of tomorrow--seats by her at the barbecue,<br> all the waltzes (and they'd see to it that the dances were all<br> waltzes!) and the supper intermission. This was worth getting<br> expelled from the university.<br><br> Filled with new enthusiasm by their success, they lingered on,<br> talking about the barbecue and the ball and Ashley Wilkes and<br> Melanie Hamilton, interrupting each other, making jokes and<br> laughing at them, hinting broadly for invitations to supper. Some<br> time had passed before they realized that Scarlett was having very<br> little to say. The atmosphere had somehow changed. Just how, the<br> twins did not know, but the fine glow had gone out of the<br> afternoon. Scarlett seemed to be paying little attention to what<br> they said, although she made the correct answers. Sensing<br> something they could not understand, baffled and annoyed by it,<br> the twins struggled along for a while, and then rose reluctantly,<br> looking at their watches.<br><br> The sun was low across the new-plowed fields and the tall woods<br> across the river were looming blackly in silhouette. Chimney<br> swallows were darting swiftly across the yard, and chickens, ducks<br> and turkeys were waddling and strutting and straggling in from the<br> fields.<br><br> Stuart bellowed: ‘Jeems!’ And after an interval a tall black boy<br> of their own age ran breathlessly around the house and out toward<br> the tethered horses. Jeems was their body servant and, like the<br> dogs, accompanied them everywhere. He had been their childhood<br> playmate and had been given to the twins for their own on their<br> tenth birthday. At the sight of him, the Tarleton hounds rose up<br> out of the red dust and stood waiting expectantly for their<br> masters. The boys bowed, shook hands and told Scarlett they'd be<br> over at the Wilkeses' early in the morning, waiting for her. Then<br> they were off down the walk at a rush, mounted their horses and,<br> followed by Jeems, went down the avenue of cedars at a gallop,<br> waving their hats and yelling back to her.<br><br> When they had rounded the curve of the dusty road that hid them<br> from Tara, Brent drew his horse to a stop under a clump of<br> dogwood. Stuart halted, too, and the darky boy pulled up a few<br> paces behind them. The horses, feeling slack reins, stretched<br> down their necks to crop the tender spring grass, and the patient<br> hounds lay down again in the soft red dust and looked up longingly<br> at the chimney swallows circling in the gathering dusk. Brent's<br> wide ingenuous face was puzzled and mildly indignant.<br><br> ‘Look,’ he said. ‘Don't it look to you like she would of asked us<br> to stay for supper?’<br><br> ‘I thought she would,’ said Stuart. ‘I kept waiting for her to do<br> it, but she didn't. What do you make of it?’<br><br> ‘I don't make anything of it. But it just looks to me like she<br> might of. After all, it's our first day home and she hasn't seen<br> us in quite a spell. And we had lots more things to tell her.’<br><br> ‘It looked to me like she was mighty glad to see us when we came.’<br><br> ‘I thought so, too.’<br><br> ‘And then, about a half-hour ago, she got kind of quiet, like she<br> had a headache.’<br><br> ‘I noticed that but I didn't pay it any mind then. What do you<br> suppose ailed her?’<br><br> ‘I dunno. Do you suppose we said something that made her mad?’<br><br> They both thought for a minute.<br><br> ‘I can't think of anything. Besides, when Scarlett gets mad,<br> everybody knows it. She don't hold herself in like some girls<br> do.’<br><br> ‘Yes, that's what I like about her. She don't go around being<br> cold and hateful when she's mad--she tells you about it. But it<br> was something we did or said that made her shut up talking and<br> look sort of sick. I could swear she was glad to see us when we<br> came and was aiming to ask us to supper.’<br><br> ‘You don't suppose it's because we got expelled?’<br><br> ‘Hell, no! Don't be a fool. She laughed like everything when we<br> told her about it. And besides Scarlett don't set any more store<br> by book learning than we do.’<br><br> Brent turned in the saddle and called to the negro groom.<br><br> ‘Jeems!’<br><br> ‘Suh?’<br><br> ‘You heard what we were talking to Miss Scarlett about?’<br><br> ‘Nawsuh, Mist' Brent! Huccome you think Ah be spyin' on w'ite<br> folks?’<br><br> ‘Spying, my God! You darkies know everything that goes on. Why,<br> you liar, I saw you with my own eyes sidle round the corner of the<br> porch and squat in the cape jessamine bush by the wall. Now, did<br> you hear us say anything that might have made Miss Scarlett mad--<br> or hurt her feelings?’<br><br> Thus appealed to, Jeems gave up further pretense of not having<br> overheard the conversation and furrowed his black brow.<br><br> ‘Nawsuh, Ah din' notice y'all say anything ter mek her mad. Look<br> ter me lak she sho glad ter see you an' sho had missed you, an'<br> she cheep along happy as a bird, tell 'bout de time y'all got ter<br> talkin' 'bout Mist' Ashley an' Miss Melly Hamilton gittin'<br> mah'ied. Den she quiet down lak a bird w'en de hawk fly ober.’<br><br> The twins looked at each other and nodded, but without comprehension.<br><br> ‘Jeems is right. But I don't see why,’ said Stuart. ‘My Lord!<br> Ashley don't mean anything to her, 'cept a friend. She's not<br> crazy about him. It's us she's crazy about.’<br><br> Brent nodded an agreement.<br><br> ‘But do you suppose,’ he said, ‘that maybe Ashley hadn't told her<br> he was going to announce it tomorrow night and she was mad at him<br> for not telling her, an old friend, before he told everybody else?<br> Girls set a big store on knowing such things first.’<br><br> ‘Well, maybe. But what if he hadn't told her it was tomorrow? It<br> was supposed to be a secret and a surprise, and a man's got a<br> right to keep his own engagement quiet, hasn't he? We wouldn't<br> have known it if Miss Melly's aunt hadn't let it out. But<br> Scarlett must have known he was going to marry Miss Melly<br> sometime. Why, we've known it for years. The Wilkes and<br> Hamiltons always marry their own cousins. Everybody knew he'd<br> probably marry her some day, just like Honey Wilkes is going to<br> marry Miss Melly's brother, Charles.’<br><br> ‘Well, I give it up. But I'm sorry she didn't ask us to supper.<br> I swear I don't want to go home and listen to Ma take on about us<br> being expelled. It isn't as if this was the first time.’<br><br> ‘Maybe Boyd will have smoothed her down by now. You know what a<br> slick talker that little varmint is. You know he always can<br> smooth her down.’<br><br> ‘Yes, he can do it, but it takes Boyd time. He has to talk around<br> in circles till Ma gets so confused that she gives up and tells<br> him to save his voice for his law practice. But he ain't had time<br> to get good started yet. Why, I'll bet you Ma is still so excited<br> about the new horse that she'll never even realize we're home<br> again till she sits down to supper tonight and sees Boyd. And<br> before supper is over she'll be going strong and breathing fire.<br> And it'll be ten o'clock before Boyd gets a chance to tell her<br> that it wouldn't have been honorable for any of us to stay in<br> college after the way the Chancellor talked to you and me. And<br> it'll be midnight before he gets her turned around to where she's<br> so mad at the Chancellor she'll be asking Boyd why he didn't shoot<br> him. No, we can't go home till after midnight.’<br><br> The twins looked at each other glumly. They were completely<br> fearless of wild horses, shooting affrays and the indignation of<br> their neighbors, but they had a wholesome fear of their red-haired<br> mother's outspoken remarks and the riding crop that she did not<br> scruple to lay across their breeches.<br><br> ‘Well, look,’ said Brent. ‘Let's go over to the Wilkes. Ashley<br> and the girls'll be glad to have us for supper.’<br><br> Stuart looked a little discomforted.<br><br> ‘No, don't let's go there. They'll be in a stew getting ready for<br> the barbecue tomorrow and besides--’<br><br> ‘Oh, I forgot about that,’ said Brent hastily. ‘No, don't let's<br> go there.’<br><br> They clucked to their horses and rode along in silence for a<br> while, a flush of embarrassment on Stuart's brown cheeks. Until<br> the previous summer, Stuart had courted India Wilkes with the<br> approbation of both families and the entire County. The County<br> felt that perhaps the cool and contained India Wilkes would have a<br> quieting effect on him. They fervently hoped so, at any rate.<br> And Stuart might have made the match, but Brent had not been<br> satisfied. Brent liked India but he thought her mighty plain and<br> tame, and he simply could not fall in love with her himself to<br> keep Stuart company. That was the first time the twins' interest<br> had ever diverged, and Brent was resentful of his brother's<br> attentions to a girl who seemed to him not at all remarkable.<br><br> Then, last summer at a political speaking in a grove of oak trees<br> at Jonesboro, they both suddenly became aware of Scarlett O'Hara.<br> They had known her for years, and, since their childhood, she had<br> been a favorite playmate, for she could ride horses and climb<br> trees almost as well as they. But now to their amazement she had<br> become a grown-up young lady and quite the most charming one in<br> all the world.<br><br> They noticed for the first time how her green eyes danced, how<br> deep her dimples were when she laughed, how tiny her hands and<br> feet and what a small waist she had. Their clever remarks sent<br> her into merry peals of laughter and, inspired by the thought that<br> she considered them a remarkable pair, they fairly outdid<br> themselves.<br><br> It was a memorable day in the life of the twins. Thereafter, when<br> they talked it over, they always wondered just why they had failed<br> to notice Scarlett's charms before. They never arrived at the<br> correct answer, which was that Scarlett on that day had decided to<br> make them notice. She was constitutionally unable to endure any<br> man being in love with any woman not herself, and the sight of<br> India Wilkes and Stuart at the speaking had been too much for her<br> predatory nature. Not content with Stuart alone, she had set her<br> cap for Brent as well, and with a thoroughness that overwhelmed<br> the two of them.<br><br> Now they were both in love with her, and India Wilkes and Letty<br> Munroe, from Lovejoy, whom Brent had been half-heartedly courting,<br> were far in the back of their minds. Just what the loser would<br> do, should Scarlett accept either one of them, the twins did not<br> ask. They would cross that bridge when they came to it. For the<br> present they were quite satisfied to be in accord again about one<br> girl, for they had no jealousies between them. It was a situation<br> which interested the neighbors and annoyed their mother, who had<br> no liking for Scarlett.<br><br> ‘It will serve you right if that sly piece does accept one of<br> you,’ she said. ‘Or maybe she'll accept both of you, and then<br> you'll have to move to Utah, if the Mormons'll have you--which I<br> doubt. . . . All that bothers me is that some one of these days<br> you're both going to get lickered up and jealous of each other<br> about that two-faced, little, green-eyed baggage, and you'll shoot<br> each other. But that might not be a bad idea either.’<br><br> Since the day of the speaking, Stuart had been uncomfortable in<br> India's presence. Not that India ever reproached him or even<br> indicated by look or gesture that she was aware of his abruptly<br> changed allegiance. She was too much of a lady. But Stuart felt<br> guilty and ill at ease with her. He knew he had made India love<br> him and he knew that she still loved him and, deep in his heart,<br> he had the feeling that he had not played the gentleman. He still<br> liked her tremendously and respected her for her cool good<br> breeding, her book learning and all the sterling qualities she<br> possessed. But, damn it, she was just so pallid and uninteresting<br> and always the same, beside Scarlett's bright and changeable<br> charm. You always knew where you stood with India and you never<br> had the slightest notion with Scarlett. That was enough to drive<br> a man to distraction, but it had its charm.<br><br> ‘Well, let's go over to Cade Calvert's and have supper. Scarlett<br> said Cathleen was home from Charleston. Maybe she'll have some<br> news about Fort Sumter that we haven't heard.’<br><br> ‘Not Cathleen. I'll lay you two to one she didn't even know the<br> fort was out there in the harbor, much less that it was full of<br> Yankees until we shelled them out. All she'll know about is the<br> balls she went to and the beaux she collected.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's fun to hear her gabble. And it'll be somewhere to<br> hide out till Ma has gone to bed.’<br><br> ‘Well, hell! I like Cathleen and she is fun and I'd like to hear<br> about Caro Rhett and the rest of the Charleston folks; but I'm<br> damned if I can stand sitting through another meal with that<br> Yankee stepmother of hers.’<br><br> ‘Don't be too hard on her, Stuart. She means well.’<br><br> ‘I'm not being hard on her. I feel sorry for her, but I don't<br> like people I've got to feel sorry for. And she fusses around so<br> much, trying to do the right thing and make you feel at home, that<br> she always manages to say and do just exactly the wrong thing.<br> She gives me the fidgets! And she thinks Southerners are wild<br> barbarians. She even told Ma so. She's afraid of Southerners.<br> Whenever we're there she always looks scared to death. She<br> reminds me of a skinny hen perched on a chair, her eyes kind of<br> bright and blank and scared, all ready to flap and squawk at the<br> slightest move anybody makes.’<br><br> ‘Well, you can't blame her. You did shoot Cade in the leg.’<br><br> ‘Well, I was lickered up or I wouldn't have done it,’ said Stuart.<br> ‘And Cade never had any hard feelings. Neither did Cathleen or<br> Raiford or Mr. Calvert. It was just that Yankee stepmother who<br> squalled and said I was a wild barbarian and decent people weren't<br> safe around uncivilized Southerners.’<br><br> ‘Well, you can't blame her. She's a Yankee and ain't got very<br> good manners; and, after all, you did shoot him and he is her<br> stepson.’<br><br> ‘Well, hell! That's no excuse for insulting me! You are Ma's own<br> blood son, but did she take on that time Tony Fontaine shot you in<br> the leg? No, she just sent for old Doc Fontaine to dress it and<br> asked the doctor what ailed Tony's aim. Said she guessed licker<br> was spoiling his marksmanship. Remember how mad that made Tony?’<br><br> Both boys yelled with laughter.<br><br> ‘Ma's a card!’ said Brent with loving approval. ‘You can always<br> count on her to do the right thing and not embarrass you in front<br> of folks.’<br><br> ‘Yes, but she's mighty liable to talk embarrassing in front of<br> Father and the girls when we get home tonight,’ said Stuart<br> gloomily. ‘Look, Brent. I guess this means we don't go to<br> Europe. You know Mother said if we got expelled from another<br> college we couldn't have our Grand Tour.’<br><br> ‘Well, hell! We don't care, do we? What is there to see in<br> Europe? I'll bet those foreigners can't show us a thing we<br> haven't got right here in Georgia. I'll bet their horses aren't<br> as fast or their girls as pretty, and I know damn well they<br> haven't got any rye whisky that can touch Father's.’<br><br> ‘Ashley Wilkes said they had an awful lot of scenery and music.<br> Ashley liked Europe. He's always talking about it.’<br><br> ‘Well--you know how the Wilkes are. They are kind of queer about<br> music and books and scenery. Mother says it's because their<br> grandfather came from Virginia. She says Virginians set quite a<br> store by such things.’<br><br> ‘They can have 'em. Give me a good horse to ride and some good<br> licker to drink and a good girl to court and a bad girl to have<br> fun with and anybody can have their Europe. . . . What do we care<br> about missing the Tour? Suppose we were in Europe now, with the<br> war coming on? We couldn't get home soon enough. I'd heap rather<br> go to a war than go to Europe.’<br><br> ‘So would I, any day. . . . Look, Brent! I know where we can go<br> for supper. Let's ride across the swamp to Abel Wynder's place<br> and tell him we're all four home again and ready for drill.’<br><br> ‘That's an idea!’ cried Brent with enthusiasm. ‘And we can hear<br> all the news of the Troop and find out what color they finally<br> decided on for the uniforms.’<br><br> ‘If it's Zouave, I'm damned if I'll go in the troop. I'd feel<br> like a sissy in those baggy red pants. They look like ladies' red<br> flannel drawers to me.’<br><br> ‘Is y'all aimin' ter go ter Mist' Wynder's? 'Cause ef you is, you<br> ain' gwine git much supper,’ said Jeems. ‘Dey cook done died, an'<br> dey ain' bought a new one. Dey got a fe'el han' cookin', an' de<br> niggers tells me she is de wustest cook in de state.’<br><br> ‘Good God! Why don't they buy another cook?’<br><br> ‘Huccome po' w'ite trash buy any niggers? Dey ain' never owned<br> mo'n fo' at de mostes'.’<br><br> There was frank contempt in Jeems' voice. His own social status<br> was assured because the Tarletons owned a hundred negroes and,<br> like all slaves of large planters, he looked down on small farmers<br> whose slaves were few.<br><br> ‘I'm going to beat your hide off for that,’ cried Stuart fiercely.<br> Don't you call Abel Wynder 'po' white.' Sure he's poor, but he<br> ain't trash; and I'm damned if I'll have any man, darky or white,<br> throwing off on him. There ain't a better man in this County, or<br> why else did the Troop elect him lieutenant?’<br><br> ‘Ah ain' never figgered dat out, mahseff,’ replied Jeems,<br> undisturbed by his master's scowl. ‘Look ter me lak dey'd 'lect<br> all de awficers frum rich gempmum, 'stead of swamp trash.’<br><br> ‘He ain't trash! Do you mean to compare him with real white trash<br> like the Slatterys? Able just ain't rich. He's a small farmer,<br> not a big planter, and if the boys thought enough of him to elect<br> him lieutenant, then it's not for any darky to talk impudent about<br> him. The Troop knows what it's doing.’<br><br> The troop of cavalry had been organized three months before, the<br> very day that Georgia seceded from the Union, and since then the<br> recruits had been whistling for war. The outfit was as yet<br> unnamed, though not for want of suggestions. Everyone had his own<br> idea on that subject and was loath to relinquish it, just as<br> everyone had ideas about the color and cut of the uniforms.<br> ‘Clayton Wild Cats,’ ‘Fire Eaters,’ ‘North Georgia Hussars,’<br> ‘Zouaves,’ ‘The Inland Rifles’ (although the Troop was to be armed<br> with pistols, sabers and bowie knives, and not with rifles), ‘The<br> Clayton Grays,’ ‘The Blood and Thunderers,’ ‘The Rough and<br> Readys,’ all had their adherents. Until matters were settled,<br> everyone referred to the organization as the Troop and, despite<br> the high-sounding name finally adopted, they were known to the end<br> of their usefulness simply as ‘The Troop.’<br><br> The officers were elected by the members, for no one in the County<br> had had any military experience except a few veterans of the<br> Mexican and Seminole wars and, besides, the Troop would have<br> scorned a veteran as a leader if they had not personally liked him<br> and trusted him. Everyone liked the four Tarleton boys and the<br> three Fontaines, but regretfully refused to elect them, because<br> the Tarletons got lickered up too quickly and liked to skylark,<br> and the Fontaines had such quick, murderous tempers. Ashley<br> Wilkes was elected captain, because he was the best rider in the<br> County and because his cool head was counted on to keep some<br> semblance of order. Raiford Calvert was made first lieutenant,<br> because everybody liked Raif, and Able Wynder, son of a swamp<br> trapper, himself a small farmer, was elected second lieutenant.<br><br> Abel was a shrewd, grave giant, illiterate, kind of heart, older<br> than the other boys and with as good or better manners in the<br> presence of ladies. There was little snobbery in the Troop. Too<br> many of their fathers and grandfathers had come up to wealth from<br> the small farmer class for that. Moreover, Able was the best shot<br> in the Troop, a real sharpshooter who could pick out the eye of a<br> squirrel at seventy-five yards, and, too, he knew all about living<br> outdoors, building fires in the rain, tracking animals and finding<br> water. The Troop bowed to real worth and moreover, because they<br> liked him, they made him an officer. He bore the honor gravely<br> and with no untoward conceit, as though it were only his due. But<br> the planters' ladies and the planters' slaves could not overlook<br> the fact that he was not born a gentleman, even if their men folks<br> could.<br><br> In the beginning, the Troop had been recruited exclusively from<br> the sons of planters, a gentleman's outfit, each man supplying his<br> own horse, arms, equipment, uniform and body servant. But rich<br> planters were few in the young county of Clayton, and, in order to<br> muster a full-strength troop, it had been necessary to raise more<br> recruits among the sons of small farmers, hunters in the<br> backwoods, swamp trappers, Crackers and, in a very few cases, even<br> poor whites, if they were above the average of their class.<br><br> These latter young men were as anxious to fight the Yankees,<br> should war come, as were their richer neighbors; but the delicate<br> question of money arose. Few small farmers owned horses. They<br> carried on their farm operations with mules and they had no<br> surplus of these, seldom more than four. The mules could not be<br> spared to go off to war, even if they had been acceptable for the<br> Troop, which they emphatically were not. As for the poor whites,<br> they considered themselves well off if they owned one mule. The<br> backwoods folks and the swamp dwellers owned neither horses nor<br> mules. They lived entirely off the produce of their lands and the<br> game in the swamp, conducting their business generally by the<br> barter system and seldom seeing five dollars in cash a year, and<br> horses and uniforms were out of their reach. But they were as<br> fiercely proud in their poverty as the planters were in their<br> wealth, and they would accept nothing that smacked of charity from<br> their rich neighbors. So, to save the feelings of all and to<br> bring the Troop up to full strength, Scarlett's father, John<br> Wilkes, Buck Munroe, Jim Tarleton, Hugh Calvert, in fact every<br> large planter in the County with the one exception of Angus<br> MacIntosh, had contributed money to completely outfit the Troop,<br> horse and man. The upshot of the matter was that every planter<br> agreed to pay for equipping his own sons and a certain number of<br> the others, but the manner of handling the arrangements was such<br> that the less wealthy members of the outfit could accept horses<br> and uniforms without offense to their honor.<br><br> The Troop met twice a week in Jonesboro to drill and to pray for<br> the war to begin. Arrangements had not yet been completed for<br> obtaining the full quota of horses, but those who had horses<br> performed what they imagined to be cavalry maneuvers in the field<br> behind the courthouse, kicked up a great deal of dust, yelled<br> themselves hoarse and waved the Revolutionary-war swords that had<br> been taken down from parlor walls. Those who, as yet, had no<br> horses sat on the curb in front of Bullard's store and watched<br> their mounted comrades, chewed tobacco and told yarns. Or else<br> engaged in shooting matches. There was no need to teach any of<br> the men to shoot. Most Southerners were born with guns in their<br> hands, and lives spent in hunting had made marksmen of them all.<br><br> From planters' homes and swamp cabins, a varied array of firearms<br> came to each muster. There were long squirrel guns that had been<br> new when first the Alleghenies were crossed, old muzzle-loaders<br> that had claimed many an Indian when Georgia was new, horse<br> pistols that had seen service in 1812, in the Seminole wars and in<br> Mexico, silver-mounted dueling pistols, pocket derringers, double-<br> barreled hunting pieces and handsome new rifles of English make<br> with shining stocks of fine wood.<br><br> Drill always ended in the saloons of Jonesboro, and by nightfall<br> so many fights had broken out that the officers were hard put to<br> ward off casualties until the Yankees could inflict them. It was<br> during one of these brawls that Stuart Tarleton had shot Cade<br> Calvert and Tony Fontaine had shot Brent. The twins had been at<br> home, freshly expelled from the University of Virginia, at the<br> time the Troop was organized and they had joined enthusiastically;<br> but after the shooting episode, two months ago, their mother had<br> packed them off to the state university, with orders to stay<br> there. They had sorely missed the excitement of the drills while<br> away, and they counted education well lost if only they could ride<br> and yell and shoot off rifles in the company of their friends.<br><br> ‘Well, let's cut across country to Abel's,’ suggested Brent. ‘We<br> can go through Mr. O'Hara's river bottom and the Fontaine's<br> pasture and get there in no time.’<br><br> ‘We ain' gwine git nothin' ter eat 'cept possum an' greens,’<br> argued Jeems.<br><br> ‘You ain't going to get anything,’ grinned Stuart. ‘Because you<br> are going home and tell Ma that we won't be home for supper.’<br><br> ‘No, Ah ain'!’ cried Jeems in alarm. ‘No, Ah ain'! Ah doan git<br> no mo' fun outer havin' Miss Beetriss lay me out dan y'all does.<br> Fust place she'll ast me huccome Ah let y'all git expelled agin.<br> An' nex' thing, huccome Ah din' bring y'all home ternight so she<br> could lay you out. An' den she'll light on me lak a duck on a<br> June bug, an' fust thing Ah know Ah'll be ter blame fer it all.<br> Ef y'all doan tek me ter Mist' Wynder's, Ah'll lay out in de woods<br> all night an' maybe de patterollers git me, 'cause Ah heap ruther<br> de patterollers git me dan Miss Beetriss when she in a state.’<br><br> The twins looked at the determined black boy in perplexity and<br> indignation.<br><br> ‘He'd be just fool enough to let the patterollers get him and that<br> would give Ma something else to talk about for weeks. I swear,<br> darkies are more trouble. Sometimes I think the Abolitionists<br> have got the right idea.’<br><br> ‘Well, it wouldn't be right to make Jeems face what we don't want<br> to face. We'll have to take him. But, look, you impudent black<br> fool, if you put on any airs in front of the Wynder darkies and<br> hint that we all the time have fried chicken and ham, while they<br> don't have nothing but rabbit and possum, I'll--I'll tell Ma. And<br> we won't let you go to the war with us, either.’<br><br> ‘Airs? Me put on airs fo' dem cheap niggers? Nawsuh, Ah got<br> better manners. Ain' Miss Beetriss taught me manners same as she<br> taught y'all?’<br><br> ‘She didn't do a very good job on any of the three of us,’ said<br> Stuart. ‘Come on, let's get going.’<br><br> He backed his big red horse and then, putting spurs to his side,<br> lifted him easily over the split rail fence into the soft field of<br> Gerald O'Hara's plantation. Brent's horse followed and then<br> Jeems', with Jeems clinging to pommel and mane. Jeems did not<br> like to jump fences, but he had jumped higher ones than this in<br> order to keep up with his masters.<br><br> As they picked their way across the red furrows and down the hill<br> to the river bottom in the deepening dusk, Brent yelled to his<br> brother:<br><br> ‘Look, Stu! Don't it seem like to you that Scarlett WOULD have<br> asked us to supper?’<br><br> ‘I kept thinking she would,’ yelled Stuart. ‘Why do you<br> suppose . . .’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER II<br><br> <br> When the twins left Scarlett standing on the porch of Tara and the<br> last sound of flying hooves had died away, she went back to her<br> chair like a sleepwalker. Her face felt stiff as from pain and<br> her mouth actually hurt from having stretched it, unwillingly, in<br> smiles to prevent the twins from learning her secret. She sat<br> down wearily, tucking one foot under her, and her heart swelled up<br> with misery, until it felt too large for her bosom. It beat with<br> odd little jerks; her hands were cold, and a feeling of disaster<br> oppressed her. There were pain and bewilderment in her face, the<br> bewilderment of a pampered child who has always had her own way<br> for the asking and who now, for the first time, was in contact<br> with the unpleasantness of life.<br><br> Ashley to marry Melanie Hamilton!<br><br> Oh, it couldn't be true! The twins were mistaken. They were<br> playing one of their jokes on her. Ashley couldn't, couldn't be<br> in love with her. Nobody could, not with a mousy little person<br> like Melanie. Scarlett recalled with contempt Melanie's thin<br> childish figure, her serious heart-shaped face that was plain<br> almost to homeliness. And Ashley couldn't have seen her in<br> months. He hadn't been in Atlanta more than twice since the house<br> party he gave last year at Twelve Oaks. No, Ashley couldn't be in<br> love with Melanie, because--oh, she couldn't be mistaken!--because<br> he was in love with her! She, Scarlett, was the one he loved--she<br> knew it!<br><br> Scarlett heard Mammy's lumbering tread shaking the floor of the<br> hall and she hastily untucked her foot and tried to rearrange her<br> face in more placid lines. It would never do for Mammy to suspect<br> that anything was wrong. Mammy felt that she owned the O'Haras,<br> body and soul, that their secrets were her secrets; and even a<br> hint of a mystery was enough to set her upon the trail as<br> relentlessly as a bloodhound. Scarlett knew from experience that,<br> if Mammy's curiosity were not immediately satisfied, she would<br> take up the matter with Ellen, and then Scarlett would be forced<br> to reveal everything to her mother, or think up some plausible<br> lie.<br><br> Mammy emerged from the hall, a huge old woman with the small,<br> shrewd eyes of an elephant. She was shining black, pure African,<br> devoted to her last drop of blood to the O'Haras, Ellen's<br> mainstay, the despair of her three daughters, the terror of the<br> other house servants. Mammy was black, but her code of conduct<br> and her sense of pride were as high as or higher than those of her<br> owners. She had been raised in the bedroom of Solange Robillard,<br> Ellen O'Hara's mother, a dainty, cold, high-nosed French-woman,<br> who spared neither her children nor her servants their just<br> punishment for any infringement of decorum. She had been Ellen's<br> mammy and had come with her from Savannah to the up-country when<br> she married. Whom Mammy loved, she chastened. And, as her love<br> for Scarlett and her pride in her were enormous, the chastening<br> process was practically continuous.<br><br> ‘Is de gempmum gone? Huccome you din' ast dem ter stay fer<br> supper, Miss Scarlett? Ah done tole Poke ter lay two extry plates<br> fer dem. Whar's yo' manners?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I was so tired of hearing them talk about the war that I<br> couldn't have endured it through supper, especially with Pa<br> joining in and shouting about Mr. Lincoln.’<br><br> ‘You ain' got no mo' manners dan a fe'el han', an' after Miss<br> Ellen an' me done labored wid you. An' hyah you is widout yo'<br> shawl! An' de night air fixin' ter set in! Ah done tole you an'<br> tole you 'bout gittin' fever frum settin' in de night air wid<br> nuthin' on yo' shoulders. Come on in de house, Miss Scarlett.’<br><br> Scarlett turned away from Mammy with studied nonchalance, thankful<br> that her face had been unnoticed in Mammy's preoccupation with the<br> matter of the shawl.<br><br> ‘No, I want to sit here and watch the sunset. It's so pretty.<br> You run get my shawl. Please, Mammy, and I'll sit here till Pa<br> comes home.’<br><br> ‘Yo' voice soun' lak you catchin' a cole,’ said Mammy suspiciously.<br><br> ‘Well, I'm not,’ said Scarlett impatiently. ‘You fetch me my<br> shawl.’<br><br> Mammy waddled back into the hall and Scarlett heard her call<br> softly up the stairwell to the upstairs maid.<br><br> ‘You, Rosa! Drap me Miss Scarlett's shawl.’ Then, more loudly:<br> ‘Wuthless nigger! She ain' never whar she does nobody no good.<br> Now, Ah got ter climb up an' git it mahseff.’<br><br> Scarlett heard the stairs groan and she got softly to her feet.<br> When Mammy returned she would resume her lecture on Scarlett's<br> breach of hospitality, and Scarlett felt that she could not endure<br> prating about such a trivial matter when her heart was breaking.<br> As she stood, hesitant, wondering where she could hide until the<br> ache in her breast subsided a little, a thought came to her,<br> bringing a small ray of hope. Her father had ridden over to<br> Twelve Oaks, the Wilkes plantation, that afternoon to offer to buy<br> Dilcey, the broad wife of his valet, Pork. Dilcey was head woman<br> and midwife at Twelve Oaks, and, since the marriage six months<br> ago, Pork had deviled his master night and day to buy Dilcey, so<br> the two could live on the same plantation. That afternoon,<br> Gerald, his resistance worn thin, had set out to make an offer for<br> Dilcey.<br><br> Surely, thought Scarlett, Pa will know whether this awful story is<br> true. Even if he hasn't actually heard anything this afternoon,<br> perhaps he's noticed something, sensed some excitement in the<br> Wilkes family. If I can just see him privately before supper,<br> perhaps I'll find out the truth--that it's just one of the twins'<br> nasty practical jokes.<br><br> It was time for Gerald's return and, if she expected to see him<br> alone, there was nothing for her to do except meet him where the<br> driveway entered the road. She went quietly down the front steps,<br> looking carefully over her shoulder to make sure Mammy was not<br> observing her from the upstairs windows. Seeing no broad black<br> face, turbaned in snowy white, peering disapprovingly from between<br> fluttering curtains, she boldly snatched up her green flowered<br> skirts and sped down the path toward the driveway as fast as her<br> small ribbon-laced slippers would carry her.<br><br> The dark cedars on either side of the graveled drive met in an<br> arch overhead, turning the long avenue into a dim tunnel. As soon<br> as she was beneath the gnarled arms of the cedars, she knew she<br> was safe from observation from the house and she slowed her swift<br> pace. She was panting, for her stays were laced too tightly to<br> permit much running, but she walked on as rapidly as she could.<br> Soon she was at the end of the driveway and out on the main road,<br> but she did not stop until she had rounded a curve that put a<br> large clump of trees between her and the house.<br><br> Flushed and breathing hard, she sat down on a stump to wait for<br> her father. It was past time for him to come home, but she was<br> glad that he was late. The delay would give her time to quiet her<br> breathing and calm her face so that his suspicions would not be<br> aroused. Every moment she expected to hear the pounding of his<br> horse's hooves and see him come charging up the hill at his usual<br> breakneck speed. But the minutes slipped by and Gerald did not<br> come. She looked down the road for him, the pain in her heart<br> swelling up again.<br><br> ‘Oh, it can't be true!’ she thought. ‘Why doesn't he come?’<br><br> Her eyes followed the winding road, blood-red now after the<br> morning rain. In her thought she traced its course as it ran down<br> the hill to the sluggish Flint River, through the tangled swampy<br> bottoms and up the next hill to Twelve Oaks where Ashley lived.<br> That was all the road meant now--a road to Ashley and the<br> beautiful white-columned house that crowned the hill like a Greek<br> Temple.<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley! Ashley!’ she thought, and her heart beat faster.<br><br> Some of the cold sense of bewilderment and disaster that had<br> weighted her down since the Tarleton boys told her their gossip<br> was pushed into the background of her mind, and in its place crept<br> the fever that had possessed her for two years.<br><br> It seemed strange now that when she was growing up Ashley had<br> never seemed so very attractive to her. In childhood days, she<br> had seen him come and go and never given him a thought. But since<br> that day two years ago when Ashley, newly home from his three<br> years' Grand Tour in Europe, had called to pay his respects, she<br> had loved him. It was as simple as that.<br><br> She had been on the front porch and he had ridden up the long<br> avenue, dressed in gray broadcloth with a wide black cravat<br> setting off his frilled shirt to perfection. Even now, she could<br> recall each detail of his dress, how brightly his boots shone, the<br> head of a Medusa in cameo on his cravat pin, the wide Panama hat<br> that was instantly in his hand when he saw her. He had alighted<br> and tossed his bridle reins to a pickaninny and stood looking up<br> at her, his drowsy gray eyes wide with a smile and the sun so<br> bright on his blond hair that it seemed like a cap of shining<br> silver. And he said, ‘So you've grown up, Scarlett.’ And, coming<br> lightly up the steps, he had kissed her hand. And his voice! She<br> would never forget the leap of her heart as she heard it, as if<br> for the first time, drawling, resonant, musical.<br><br> She had wanted him, in that first instant, wanted him as simply<br> and unreasoningly as she wanted food to eat, horses to ride and a<br> soft bed on which to lay herself.<br><br> For two years he had squired her about the County, to balls, fish<br> fries, picnics and court days, never so often as the Tarleton<br> twins or Cade Calvert, never so importunate as the younger<br> Fontaine boys, but, still, never the week went by that Ashley did<br> not come calling at Tara.<br><br> True, he never made love to her, nor did the clear gray eyes ever<br> glow with that hot light Scarlett knew so well in other men. And<br> yet--and yet--she knew he loved her. She could not be mistaken<br> about it. Instinct stronger than reason and knowledge born of<br> experience told her that he loved her. Too often she had<br> surprised him when his eyes were neither drowsy nor remote, when<br> he looked at her with a yearning and a sadness which puzzled her.<br> She KNEW he loved her. Why did he not tell her so? That she<br> could not understand. But there were so many things about him<br> that she did not understand.<br><br> He was courteous always, but aloof, remote. No one could ever<br> tell what he was thinking about, Scarlett least of all. In a<br> neighborhood where everyone said exactly what he thought as soon<br> as he thought it, Ashley's quality of reserve was exasperating.<br> He was as proficient as any of the other young men in the usual<br> County diversions, hunting, gambling, dancing and politics, and<br> was the best rider of them all; but he differed from all the rest<br> in that these pleasant activities were not the end and aim of life<br> to him. And he stood alone in his interest in books and music and<br> his fondness for writing poetry.<br><br> Oh, why was he so handsomely blond, so courteously aloof, so<br> maddeningly boring with his talk about Europe and books and music<br> and poetry and things that interested her not at all--and yet so<br> desirable? Night after night, when Scarlett went to bed after<br> sitting on the front porch in the semi-darkness with him, she<br> tossed restlessly for hours and comforted herself only with the<br> thought that the very next time he saw her he certainly would<br> propose. But the next time came and went, and the result was<br> nothing--nothing except that the fever possessing her rose higher<br> and hotter.<br><br> She loved him and she wanted him and she did not understand him.<br> She was as forthright and simple as the winds that blew over Tara<br> and the yellow river that wound about it, and to the end of her<br> days she would never be able to understand a complexity. And now,<br> for the first time in her life, she was facing a complex nature.<br><br> For Ashley was born of a line of men who used their leisure for<br> thinking, not doing, for spinning brightly colored dreams that had<br> in them no touch of reality. He moved in an inner world that was<br> more beautiful than Georgia and came back to reality with<br> reluctance. He looked on people, and he neither liked nor<br> disliked them. He looked on life and was neither heartened nor<br> saddened. He accepted the universe and his place in it for what<br> they were and, shrugging, turned to his music and books and his<br> better world.<br><br> Why he should have captivated Scarlett when his mind was a<br> stranger to hers she did not know. The very mystery of him<br> excited her curiosity like a door that had neither lock nor key.<br> The things about him which she could not understand only made her<br> love him more, and his odd, restrained courtship only served to<br> increase her determination to have him for her own. That he would<br> propose some day she had never doubted, for she was too young and<br> too spoiled ever to have known defeat. And now, like a thunderclap,<br> had come this horrible news. Ashley to marry Melanie! It couldn't<br> be true!<br><br> Why, only last week, when they were riding home at twilight from<br> Fairhill, he had said: ‘Scarlett, I have something so important<br> to tell you that I hardly know how to say it.’<br><br> She had cast down her eyes demurely, her heart beating with wild<br> pleasure, thinking the happy moment had come. Then he had said:<br> ‘Not now! We're nearly home and there isn't time. Oh, Scarlett,<br> what a coward I am!’ And putting spurs to his horse, he had raced<br> her up the hill to Tara.<br><br> Scarlett, sitting on the stump, thought of those words which had<br> made her so happy, and suddenly they took on another meaning, a<br> hideous meaning. Suppose it was the news of his engagement he had<br> intended to tell her!<br><br> Oh, if Pa would only come home! She could not endure the suspense<br> another moment. She looked impatiently down the road again, and<br> again she was disappointed.<br><br> The sun was now below the horizon and the red glow at the rim of<br> the world faded into pink. The sky above turned slowly from azure<br> to the delicate blue-green of a robin's egg, and the unearthly<br> stillness of rural twilight came stealthily down about her.<br> Shadowy dimness crept over the countryside. The red furrows and<br> the gashed red road lost their magical blood color and became<br> plain brown earth. Across the road, in the pasture, the horses,<br> mules and cows stood quietly with heads over the split-rail fence,<br> waiting to be driven to the stables and supper. They did not like<br> the dark shade of the thickets hedging the pasture creek, and they<br> twitched their ears at Scarlett as if appreciative of human<br> companionship.<br><br> In the strange half-light, the tall pines of the river swamp, so<br> warmly green in the sunshine, were black against the pastel sky,<br> an impenetrable row of black giants hiding the slow yellow water<br> at their feet. On the hill across the river, the tall white<br> chimneys of the Wilkes' home faded gradually into the darkness of<br> the thick oaks surrounding them, and only far-off pin points of<br> supper lamps showed that a house was here. The warm damp<br> balminess of spring encompassed her sweetly with the moist smells<br> of new-plowed earth and all the fresh green things pushing up to<br> the air.<br><br> Sunset and spring and new-fledged greenery were no miracle to<br> Scarlett. Their beauty she accepted as casually as the air she<br> breathed and the water she drank, for she had never consciously<br> seen beauty in anything but women's faces, horses, silk dresses<br> and like tangible things. Yet the serene half-light over Tara's<br> well-kept acres brought a measure of quiet to her disturbed mind.<br> She loved this land so much, without even knowing she loved it,<br> loved it as she loved her mother's face under the lamp at prayer<br> time.<br><br> Still there was no sign of Gerald on the quiet winding road. If<br> she had to wait much longer, Mammy would certainly come in search<br> of her and bully her into the house. But even as she strained her<br> eyes down the darkening road, she heard a pounding of hooves at<br> the bottom of the pasture hill and saw the horses and cows scatter<br> in fright. Gerald O'Hara was coming home across country and at<br> top speed.<br><br> He came up the hill at a gallop on his thick-barreled, long-legged<br> hunter, appearing in the distance like a boy on a too large horse.<br> His long white hair standing out behind him, he urged the horse<br> forward with crop and loud cries.<br><br> Filled with her own anxieties, she nevertheless watched him with<br> affectionate pride, for Gerald was an excellent horseman.<br><br> ‘I wonder why he always wants to jump fences when he's had a few<br> drinks,’ she thought. ‘And after that fall he had right here last<br> year when he broke his knee. You'd think he'd learn. Especially<br> when he promised Mother on oath he'd never jump again.’<br><br> Scarlett had no awe of her father and felt him more her contemporary<br> than her sisters, for jumping fences and keeping it a secret from<br> his wife gave him a boyish pride and guilty glee that matched her<br> own pleasure in outwitting Mammy. She rose from her seat to watch<br> him.<br><br> The big horse reached the fence, gathered himself and soared over<br> as effortlessly as a bird, his rider yelling enthusiastically, his<br> crop beating the air, his white curls jerking out behind him.<br> Gerald did not see his daughter in the shadow of the trees, and he<br> drew rein in the road, patting his horse's neck with approbation.<br><br> ‘There's none in the County can touch you, nor in the state,’ he<br> informed his mount, with pride, the brogue of County Meath still<br> heavy on his tongue in spite of thirty-nine years in America.<br> Then he hastily set about smoothing his hair and settling his<br> ruffled shirt and his cravat which had slipped awry behind one<br> ear. Scarlett knew these hurried preenings were being made with<br> an eye toward meeting his wife with the appearance of a gentleman<br> who had ridden sedately home from a call on a neighbor. She knew<br> also that he was presenting her with just the opportunity she<br> wanted for opening the conversation without revealing her true<br> purpose.<br><br> She laughed aloud. As she had intended, Gerald was startled by<br> the sound; then he recognized her, and a look both sheepish and<br> defiant came over his florid face. He dismounted with difficulty,<br> because his knee was stiff, and, slipping the reins over his arm,<br> stumped toward her.<br><br> ‘Well, Missy,’ he said, pinching her cheek, ‘so, you've been<br> spying on me and, like your sister Suellen last week, you'll be<br> telling your mother on me?’<br><br> There was indignation in his hoarse bass voice but also a<br> wheedling note, and Scarlett teasingly clicked her tongue against<br> her teeth as she reached out to pull his cravat into place. His<br> breath in her face was strong with Bourbon whisky mingled with a<br> faint fragrance of mint. Accompanying him also were the smells of<br> chewing tobacco, well-oiled leather and horses--a combination of<br> odors that she always associated with her father and instinctively<br> liked in other men.<br><br> ‘No, Pa, I'm no tattletale like Suellen,’ she assured him,<br> standing off to view his rearranged attire with a judicious air.<br><br> Gerald was a small man, little more than five feet tall, but so<br> heavy of barrel and thick of neck that his appearance, when<br> seated, led strangers to think him a larger man. His thickset<br> torso was supported by short sturdy legs, always incased in the<br> finest leather boots procurable and always planted wide apart like<br> a swaggering small boy's. Most small people who take themselves<br> seriously are a little ridiculous; but the bantam cock is<br> respected in the barnyard, and so it was with Gerald. No one<br> would ever have the temerity to think of Gerald O'Hara as a<br> ridiculous little figure.<br><br> He was sixty years old and his crisp curly hair was silver-white,<br> but his shrewd face was unlined and his hard little blue eyes were<br> young with the unworried youthfulness of one who has never taxed<br> his brain with problems more abstract than how many cards to draw<br> in a poker game. His was as Irish a face as could be found in the<br> length and breadth of the homeland he had left so long ago--round,<br> high colored, short nosed, wide mouthed and belligerent.<br><br> Beneath his choleric exterior Gerald O'Hara had the tenderest of<br> hearts. He could not bear to see a slave pouting under a<br> reprimand, no matter how well deserved, or hear a kitten mewing or<br> a child crying; but he had a horror of having this weakness<br> discovered. That everyone who met him did discover his kindly<br> heart within five minutes was unknown to him; and his vanity would<br> have suffered tremendously if he had found it out, for he liked to<br> think that when he bawled orders at the top of his voice everyone<br> trembled and obeyed. It had never occurred to him that only one<br> voice was obeyed on the plantation--the soft voice of his wife<br> Ellen. It was a secret he would never learn, for everyone from<br> Ellen down to the stupidest field hand was in a tacit and kindly<br> conspiracy to keep him believing that his word was law.<br><br> Scarlett was impressed less than anyone else by his tempers and<br> his roarings. She was his oldest child and, now that Gerald knew<br> there would be no more sons to follow the three who lay in the<br> family burying ground, he had drifted into a habit of treating her<br> in a man-to-man manner which she found most pleasant. She was<br> more like her father than her younger sisters, for Carreen, who<br> had been born Caroline Irene, was delicate and dreamy, and<br> Suellen, christened Susan Elinor, prided herself on her elegance<br> and ladylike deportment.<br><br> Moreover, Scarlett and her father were bound together by a mutual<br> suppression agreement. If Gerald caught her climbing a fence<br> instead of walking half a mile to a gate, or sitting too late on<br> the front steps with a beau, he castigated her personally and with<br> vehemence, but he did not mention the fact to Ellen or to Mammy.<br> And when Scarlett discovered him jumping fences after his solemn<br> promise to his wife, or learned the exact amount of his losses at<br> poker, as she always did from County gossip, she refrained from<br> mentioning the fact at the supper table in the artfully artless<br> manner Suellen had. Scarlett and her father each assured the<br> other solemnly that to bring such matters to the ears of Ellen<br> would only hurt her, and nothing would induce them to wound her<br> gentleness.<br><br> Scarlett looked at her father in the fading light, and, without<br> knowing why, she found it comforting to be in his presence. There<br> was something vital and earthy and coarse about him that appealed<br> to her. Being the least analytic of people, she did not realize<br> that this was because she possessed in some degree these same<br> qualities, despite sixteen years of effort on the part of Ellen<br> and Mammy to obliterate them.<br><br> ‘You look very presentable now,’ she said, ‘and I don't think<br> anyone will suspect you've been up to your tricks unless you brag<br> about them. But it does seem to me that after you broke your knee<br> last year, jumping that same fence--’<br><br> ‘Well, may I be damned if I'll have me own daughter telling me<br> what I shall jump and not jump,’ he shouted, giving her cheek<br> another pinch. ‘It's me own neck, so it is. And besides, Missy,<br> what are you doing out here without your shawl?’<br><br> Seeing that he was employing familiar maneuvers to extricate<br> himself from unpleasant conversation, she slipped her arm through<br> his and said: ‘I was waiting for you. I didn't know you would be<br> so late. I just wondered if you had bought Dilcey.’<br><br> ‘Bought her I did, and the price has ruined me. Bought her and<br> her little wench, Prissy. John Wilkes was for almost giving them<br> away, but never will I have it said that Gerald O'Hara used<br> friendship in a trade. I made him take three thousand for the two<br> of them.’<br><br> ‘In the name of Heaven, Pa, three thousand! And you didn't need<br> to buy Prissy!’<br><br> ‘Has the time come when me own daughters sit in judgment on me?’<br> shouted Gerald rhetorically. ‘Prissy is a likely little wench and<br> so--’<br><br> ‘I know her. She's a sly, stupid creature,’ Scarlett rejoined<br> calmly, unimpressed by his uproar. ‘And the only reason you<br> bought her was because Dilcey asked you to buy her.’<br><br> Gerald looked crestfallen and embarrassed, as always when caught<br> in a kind deed, and Scarlett laughed outright at his transparency.<br><br> ‘Well, what if I did? Was there any use buying Dilcey if she was<br> going to mope about the child? Well, never again will I let a<br> darky on this place marry off it. It's too expensive. Well, come<br> on, Puss, let's go in to supper.’<br><br> The shadows were falling thicker now, the last greenish tinge had<br> left the sky and a slight chill was displacing the balminess of<br> spring. But Scarlett loitered, wondering how to bring up the<br> subject of Ashley without permitting Gerald to suspect her motive.<br> This was difficult, for Scarlett had not a subtle bone in her<br> body; and Gerald was so much like her he never failed to penetrate<br> her weak subterfuges, even as she penetrated his. And he was<br> seldom tactful in doing it.<br><br> ‘How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?’<br><br> ‘About as usual. Cade Calvert was there and, after I settled<br> about Dilcey, we all set on the gallery and had several toddies.<br> Cade has just come from Atlanta, and it's all upset they are there<br> and talking war and--’<br><br> Scarlett sighed. If Gerald once got on the subject of war and<br> secession, it would be hours before he relinquished it. She broke<br> in with another line.<br><br> ‘Did they say anything about the barbecue tomorrow?’<br><br> ‘Now that I think of it they did. Miss--what's-her-name--the<br> sweet little thing who was here last year, you know, Ashley's<br> cousin--oh, yes, Miss Melanie Hamilton, that's the name--she and<br> her brother Charles have already come from Atlanta and--’<br><br> ‘Oh, so she did come?’<br><br> ‘She did, and a sweet quiet thing she is, with never a word to say<br> for herself, like a woman should be. Come now, daughter, don't<br> lag. Your mother will be hunting for us.’<br><br> Scarlett's heart sank at the news. She had hoped against hope<br> that something would keep Melanie Hamilton in Atlanta where she<br> belonged, and the knowledge that even her father approved of her<br> sweet quiet nature, so different from her own, forced her into the<br> open.<br><br> ‘Was Ashley there, too?’<br><br> ‘He was.’ Gerald let go of his daughter's arm and turned, peering<br> sharply into her face. ‘And if that's why you came out here to<br> wait for me, why didn't you say so without beating around the<br> bush?’<br><br> Scarlett could think of nothing to say, and she felt her face<br> growing red with annoyance.<br><br> ‘Well, speak up.’<br><br> Still she said nothing, wishing that it was permissible to shake<br> one's father and tell him to hush his mouth.<br><br> ‘He was there and he asked most kindly after you, as did his<br> sisters, and said they hoped nothing would keep you from the<br> barbecue tomorrow. I'll warrant nothing will,’ he said shrewdly.<br> ‘And now, daughter, what's all this about you and Ashley?’<br><br> ‘There is nothing,’ she said shortly, tugging at his arm. ‘Let's<br> go in, Pa.’<br><br> ‘So now 'tis you wanting to go in,’ he observed. ‘But here I'm<br> going to stand till I'm understanding you. Now that I think of<br> it, 'tis strange you've been recently. Has he been trifling with<br> you? Has he asked to marry you?’<br><br> ‘No,’ she said shortly.<br><br> ‘Nor will he,’ said Gerald.<br><br> Fury flamed in her, but Gerald waved her quiet with a hand.<br><br> ‘Hold your tongue, Miss! I had it from John Wilkes this afternoon<br> in the strictest confidence that Ashley's to marry Miss Melanie.<br> It's to be announced tomorrow.’<br><br> Scarlett's hand fell from his arm. So it was true!<br><br> A pain slashed at her heart as savagely as a wild animal's fangs.<br> Through it all, she felt her father's eyes on her, a little<br> pitying, a little annoyed at being faced with a problem for which<br> he knew no answer. He loved Scarlett, but it made him uncomfortable<br> to have her forcing her childish problems on him for a solution.<br> Ellen knew all the answers. Scarlett should have taken her troubles<br> to her.<br><br> ‘Is it a spectacle you've been making of yourself--of all of us?’<br> he bawled, his voice rising as always in moments of excitement.<br> ‘Have you been running after a man who's not in love with you,<br> when you could have any of the bucks in the County?’<br><br> Anger and hurt pride drove out some of the pain.<br><br> ‘I haven't been running after him. It--it just surprised me.’<br><br> ‘It's lying you are!’ said Gerald, and then, peering at her<br> stricken face, he added in a burst of kindliness: ‘I'm sorry,<br> daughter. But after all, you are nothing but a child and there's<br> lots of other beaux.’<br><br> ‘Mother was only fifteen when she married you, and I'm sixteen,’<br> said Scarlett, her voice muffled.<br><br> ‘Your mother was different,’ said Gerald. ‘She was never flighty<br> like you. Now come, daughter, cheer up, and I'll take you to<br> Charleston next week to visit your Aunt Eulalie and, what with all<br> the hullabaloo they are having over there about Fort Sumter,<br> you'll be forgetting about Ashley in a week.’<br><br> ‘He thinks I'm a child,’ thought Scarlett, grief and anger choking<br> utterance, ‘and he's only got to dangle a new toy and I'll forget<br> my bumps.’<br><br> ‘Now, don't be jerking your chin at me,’ warned Gerald. ‘If you<br> had any sense you'd have married Stuart or Brent Tarleton long<br> ago. Think it over, daughter. Marry one of the twins and then<br> the plantations will run together and Jim Tarleton and I will<br> build you a fine house, right where they join, in that big pine<br> grove and--’<br><br> ‘Will you stop treating me like a child!’ cried Scarlett. ‘I<br> don't want to go to Charleston or have a house or marry the twins.<br> I only want--’ She caught herself but not in time.<br><br> Gerald's voice was strangely quiet and he spoke slowly as if<br> drawing his words from a store of thought seldom used.<br><br> ‘It's only Ashley you're wanting, and you'll not be having him.<br> And if he wanted to marry you, 'twould be with misgivings that I'd<br> say Yes, for all the fine friendship that's between me and John<br> Wilkes.’ And, seeing her startled look, he continued: ‘I want my<br> girl to be happy and you wouldn't be happy with him.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I would! I would!’<br><br> ‘That you would not, daughter. Only when like marries like can<br> there be any happiness.’<br><br> Scarlett had a sudden treacherous desire to cry out, ‘But you've<br> been happy, and you and Mother aren't alike,’ but she repressed<br> it, fearing that he would box her ears for her impertinence.<br><br> ‘Our people and the Wilkes are different,’ he went on slowly,<br> fumbling for words. ‘The Wilkes are different from any of our<br> neighbors--different from any family I ever knew. They are queer<br> folk, and it's best that they marry their cousins and keep their<br> queerness to themselves.’<br><br> ‘Why, Pa, Ashley is not--’<br><br> ‘Hold your whist, Puss! I said nothing against the lad, for I<br> like him. And when I say queer, it's not crazy I'm meaning. He's<br> not queer like the Calverts who'd gamble everything they have on a<br> horse, or the Tarletons who turn out a drunkard or two in every<br> litter, or the Fontaines who are hot-headed little brutes and<br> after murdering a man for a fancied slight. That kind of<br> queerness is easy to understand, for sure, and but for the grace<br> of God Gerald O'Hara would be having all those faults! And I<br> don't mean that Ashley would run off with another woman, if you<br> were his wife, or beat you. You'd be happier if he did, for at<br> least you'd be understanding that. But he's queer in other ways,<br> and there's no understanding him at all. I like him, but it's<br> neither heads nor tails I can make of most he says. Now, Puss,<br> tell me true, do you understand his folderol about books and<br> poetry and music and oil paintings and such foolishness?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Pa,’ cried Scarlett impatiently, ‘if I married him, I'd<br> change all that!’<br><br> ‘Oh, you would, would you now?’ said Gerald testily, shooting a<br> sharp look at her. ‘Then it's little enough you are knowing of<br> any man living, let alone Ashley. No wife has ever changed a<br> husband one whit, and don't you be forgetting that. And as for<br> changing a Wilkes--God's nightgown, daughter! The whole family is<br> that way, and they've always been that way. And probably always<br> will. I tell you they're born queer. Look at the way they go<br> tearing up to New York and Boston to hear operas and see oil<br> paintings. And ordering French and German books by the crate from<br> the Yankees! And there they sit reading and dreaming the dear God<br> knows what, when they'd be better spending their time hunting and<br> playing poker as proper men should.’<br><br> ‘There's nobody in the County sits a horse better than Ashley,’<br> said Scarlett, furious at the slur of effeminacy flung on Ashley,<br> ‘nobody except maybe his father. And as for poker, didn't Ashley<br> take two hundred dollars away from you just last week in<br> Jonesboro?’<br><br> ‘The Calvert boys have been blabbing again,’ Gerald said<br> resignedly, ‘else you'd not be knowing the amount. Ashley can<br> ride with the best and play poker with the best--that's me, Puss!<br> And I'm not denying that when he sets out to drink he can put even<br> the Tarletons under the table. He can do all those things, but<br> his heart's not in it. That's why I say he's queer.’<br><br> Scarlett was silent and her heart sank. She could think of no<br> defense for this last, for she knew Gerald was right. Ashley's<br> heart was in none of the pleasant things he did so well. He was<br> never more than politely interested in any of the things that<br> vitally interested every one else.<br><br> Rightly interpreting her silence, Gerald patted her arm and said<br> triumphantly: ‘There now, Scarlett! You admit 'tis true. What<br> would you be doing with a husband like Ashley? 'Tis moonstruck<br> they all are, all the Wilkes.’ And then, in a wheedling tone:<br> ‘When I was mentioning the Tarletons the while ago, I wasn't<br> pushing them. They're fine lads, but if it's Cade Calvert you're<br> setting your cap after, why, 'tis the same with me. The Calverts<br> are good folk, all of them, for all the old man marrying a Yankee.<br> And when I'm gone--Whist, darlin', listen to me! I'll leave Tara<br> to you and Cade--’<br><br> ‘I wouldn't have Cade on a silver tray,’ cried Scarlett in fury.<br> ‘And I wish you'd quit pushing him at me! I don't want Tara or<br> any old plantation. Plantations don't amount to anything when--’<br><br> She was going to say ‘when you haven't the man you want,’ but<br> Gerald, incensed by the cavalier way in which she treated his<br> proffered gift, the thing which, next to Ellen, he loved best in<br> the whole world uttered a roar.<br><br> ‘Do you stand there, Scarlett O'Hara, and tell me that Tara--that<br> land--doesn't amount to anything?’<br><br> Scarlett nodded obstinately. Her heart was too sore to care<br> whether or not she put her father in a temper.<br><br> ‘Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything,’ he<br> shouted, his thick, short arms making wide gestures of indignation,<br> ‘for 'tis the only thing in this world that lasts, and don't you be<br> forgetting it! 'Tis the only thing worth working for, worth<br> fighting for--worth dying for.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Pa,’ she said disgustedly, ‘you talk like an Irishman!’<br><br> ‘Have I ever been ashamed of it? No, 'tis proud I am. And don't<br> be forgetting that you are half Irish, Miss! And to anyone with a<br> drop of Irish blood in them the land they live on is like their<br> mother. 'Tis ashamed of you I am this minute. I offer you the<br> most beautiful land in the world--saving County Meath in the Old<br> Country--and what do you do? You sniff!’<br><br> Gerald had begun to work himself up into a pleasurable shouting<br> rage when something in Scarlett's woebegone face stopped him.<br><br> ‘But there, you're young. 'Twill come to you, this love of land.<br> There's no getting away from it, if you're Irish. You're just a<br> child and bothered about your beaux. When you're older, you'll be<br> seeing how 'tis. . . . Now, do you be making up your mind about<br> Cade or the twins or one of Evan Munroe's young bucks, and see how<br> fine I turn you out!’<br><br> ‘Oh, Pa!’<br><br> By this time, Gerald was thoroughly tired of the conversation and<br> thoroughly annoyed that the problem should be upon his shoulders.<br> He felt aggrieved, moreover, that Scarlett should still look<br> desolate after being offered the best of the County boys and Tara,<br> too. Gerald liked his gifts to be received with clapping of hands<br> and kisses.<br><br> ‘Now, none of your pouts, Miss. It doesn't matter who you marry,<br> as long as he thinks like you and is a gentleman and a Southerner<br> and prideful. For a woman, love comes after marriage.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Pa, that's such an Old Country notion!’<br><br> ‘And a good notion it is! All this American business of running<br> around marrying for love, like servants, like Yankees! The best<br> marriages are when the parents choose for the girl. For how can a<br> silly piece like yourself tell a good man from a scoundrel? Now,<br> look at the Wilkes. What's kept them prideful and strong all<br> these generations? Why, marrying the likes of themselves,<br> marrying the cousins their family always expects them to marry.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ cried Scarlett, fresh pain striking her as Gerald's words<br> brought home the terrible inevitability of the truth.<br><br> Gerald looked at her bowed head and shuffled his feet uneasily.<br><br> ‘It's not crying you are?’ he questioned, fumbling clumsily at her<br> chin, trying to turn her face upward, his own face furrowed with<br> pity.<br><br> ‘No,’ she cried vehemently, jerking away.<br><br> ‘It's lying you are, and I'm proud of it. I'm glad there's pride<br> in you, Puss. And I want to see pride in you tomorrow at the<br> barbecue. I'll not be having the County gossiping and laughing at<br> you for mooning your heart out about a man who never gave you a<br> thought beyond friendship.’<br><br> ‘He did give me a thought,’ thought Scarlett, sorrowfully in her<br> heart. ‘Oh, a lot of thoughts! I know he did. I could tell. If<br> I'd just had a little longer, I know I could have made him say--<br> Oh, if it only wasn't that the Wilkes always feel that they have<br> to marry their cousins!’<br><br> Gerald took her arm and passed it through his.<br><br> ‘We'll be going in to supper now, and all this is between us.<br> I'll not be worrying your mother with this--nor do you do it<br> either. Blow your nose, daughter.’<br><br> Scarlett blew her nose on her torn handkerchief, and they started<br> up the dark drive arm in arm, the horse following slowly. Near<br> the house, Scarlett was at the point of speaking again when she<br> saw her mother in the dim shadows of the porch. She had on her<br> bonnet, shawl and mittens, and behind her was Mammy, her face like<br> a thundercloud, holding in her hand the black leather bag in which<br> Ellen O'Hara always carried the bandages and medicines she used in<br> doctoring the slaves. Mammy's lips were large and pendulous and,<br> when indignant, she could push out her lower one to twice its<br> normal length. It was pushed out now, and Scarlett knew that<br> Mammy was seething over something of which she did not approve.<br><br> ‘Mr. O'Hara,’ called Ellen as she saw the two coming up the<br> driveway--Ellen belonged to a generation that was formal even<br> after seventeen years of wedlock and the bearing of six children--<br> ‘Mr. O'Hara, there is illness at the Slattery house. Emmie's baby<br> has been born and is dying and must be baptized. I am going there<br> with Mammy to see what I can do.’<br><br> Her voice was raised questioningly, as though she hung on Gerald's<br> assent to her plan, a mere formality but one dear to the heart of<br> Gerald.<br><br> ‘In the name of God!’ blustered Gerald. ‘Why should those white<br> trash take you away just at your supper hour and just when I'm<br> wanting to tell you about the war talk that's going on in Atlanta!<br> Go, Mrs. O'Hara. You'd not rest easy on your pillow the night if<br> there was trouble abroad and you not there to help.’<br><br> ‘She doan never git no res' on her piller fer hoppin' up at night<br> time nursin' niggers an po' w'ite trash dat could ten' to<br> deyseff,’ grumbled Mammy in a monotone as she went down the stairs<br> toward the carriage which was waiting in the side drive.<br><br> ‘Take my place at the table, dear,’ said Ellen, patting Scarlett's<br> cheek softly with a mittened hand.<br><br> In spite of her choked-back tears, Scarlett thrilled to the never-<br> failing magic of her mother's touch, to the faint fragrance of<br> lemon verbena sachet that came from her rustling silk dress. To<br> Scarlett, there was something breath-taking about Ellen O'Hara, a<br> miracle that lived in the house with her and awed her and charmed<br> and soothed her.<br><br> Gerald helped his wife into the carriage and gave orders to the<br> coachman to drive carefully. Toby, who had handled Gerald's<br> horses for twenty years, pushed out his lips in mute indignation<br> at being told how to conduct his own business. Driving off, with<br> Mammy beside him, each was a perfect picture of pouting African<br> disapproval.<br><br> ‘If I didn't do so much for those trashy Slatterys that they'd<br> have to pay money for elsewhere,’ fumed Gerald, ‘they'd be willing<br> to sell me their miserable few acres of swamp bottom, and the<br> County would be well rid of them.’ Then, brightening, in<br> anticipation of one of his practical jokes: ‘Come daughter, let's<br> go tell Pork that instead of buying Dilcey, I've sold him to John<br> Wilkes.’<br><br> He tossed the reins of his horse to a small pickaninny standing<br> near and started up the steps. He had already forgotten<br> Scarlett's heartbreak and his mind was only on plaguing his valet.<br> Scarlett slowly climbed the steps after him, her feet leaden. She<br> thought that, after all, a mating between herself and Ashley could<br> be no queerer than that of her father and Ellen Robillard O'Hara.<br> As always, she wondered how her loud, insensitive father had<br> managed to marry a woman like her mother, for never were two<br> people further apart in birth, breeding and habits of mind.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER III<br><br> <br> Ellen O'Hara was thirty-two years old, and, according to the<br> standards of her day, she was a middle-aged woman, one who had<br> borne six children and buried three. She was a tall woman,<br> standing a head higher than her fiery little husband, but she<br> moved with such quiet grace in her swaying hoops that the height<br> attracted no attention to itself. Her neck, rising from the black<br> taffeta sheath of her basque, was creamy-skinned, rounded and<br> slender, and it seemed always tilted slightly backward by the<br> weight of her luxuriant hair in its net at the back of her head.<br> From her French mother, whose parents had fled Haiti in the<br> Revolution of 1791, had come her slanting dark eyes, shadowed by<br> inky lashes, and her black hair; and from her father, a soldier of<br> Napoleon, she had her long straight nose and her square-cut jaw<br> that was softened by the gentle curving of her cheeks. But only<br> from life could Ellen's face have acquired its look of pride that<br> had no haughtiness, its graciousness, its melancholy and its utter<br> lack of humor.<br><br> She would have been a strikingly beautiful woman had there been<br> any glow in her eyes, any responsive warmth in her smile or any<br> spontaneity in her voice that fell with gentle melody on the ears<br> of her family and her servants. She spoke in the soft slurring<br> voice of the coastal Georgian, liquid of vowels, kind to<br> consonants and with the barest trace of French accent. It was a<br> voice never raised in command to a servant or reproof to a child<br> but a voice that was obeyed instantly at Tara, where her husband's<br> blustering and roaring were quietly disregarded.<br><br> As far back as Scarlett could remember, her mother had always been<br> the same, her voice soft and sweet whether in praising or in<br> reproving, her manner efficient and unruffled despite the daily<br> emergencies of Gerald's turbulent household, her spirit always<br> calm and her back unbowed, even in the deaths of her three baby<br> sons. Scarlett had never seen her mother's back touch the back of<br> any chair on which she sat. Nor had she ever seen her sit down<br> without a bit of needlework in her hands, except at mealtime,<br> while attending the sick or while working at the bookkeeping of<br> the plantation. It was delicate embroidery if company were<br> present, but at other times her hands were occupied with Gerald's<br> ruffled shirts, the girls' dresses or garments for the slaves.<br> Scarlett could not imagine her mother's hands without her gold<br> thimble or her rustling figure unaccompanied by the small negro<br> girl whose sole function in life was to remove basting threads and<br> carry the rosewood sewing box from room to room, as Ellen moved<br> about the house superintending the cooking, the cleaning and the<br> wholesale clothes-making for the plantation.<br><br> She had never seen her mother stirred from her austere placidity,<br> nor her personal appointments anything but perfect, no matter what<br> the hour of day or night. When Ellen was dressing for a ball or<br> for guests or even to go to Jonesboro for Court Day, it frequently<br> required two hours, two maids and Mammy to turn her out to her own<br> satisfaction; but her swift toilets in times of emergency were<br> amazing.<br><br> Scarlett, whose room lay across the hall from her mother's, knew<br> from babyhood the soft sound of scurrying bare black feet on the<br> hardwood floor in the hours of dawn, the urgent tappings on her<br> mother's door, and the muffled, frightened negro voices that<br> whispered of sickness and birth and death in the long row of<br> whitewashed cabins in the quarters. As a child, she often had<br> crept to the door and, peeping through the tiniest crack, had seen<br> Ellen emerge from the dark room, where Gerald's snores were<br> rhythmic and untroubled, into the flickering light of an upheld<br> candle, her medicine case under her arm, her hair smoothed neatly<br> place, and no button on her basque unlooped.<br><br> It had always been so soothing to Scarlett to hear her mother<br> whisper, firmly but compassionately, as she tiptoed down the hall:<br> ‘Hush, not so loudly. You will wake Mr. O'Hara. They are not<br> sick enough to die.’<br><br> Yes, it was good to creep back into bed and know that Ellen was<br> abroad in the night and everything was right.<br><br> In the mornings, after all-night sessions at births and deaths,<br> when old Dr. Fontaine and young Dr. Fontaine were both out on<br> calls and could not be found to help her, Ellen presided at the<br> breakfast table as usual, her dark eyes circled with weariness but<br> her voice and manner revealing none of the strain. There was a<br> steely quality under her stately gentleness that awed the whole<br> household, Gerald as well as the girls, though he would have died<br> rather than admit it.<br><br> Sometimes when Scarlett tiptoed at night to kiss her tall mother's<br> cheek, she looked up at the mouth with its too short, too tender<br> upper lip, a mouth too easily hurt by the world, and wondered if<br> it had ever curved in silly girlish giggling or whispered secrets<br> through long nights to intimate girl friends. But no, that wasn't<br> possible. Mother had always been just as she was, a pillar of<br> strength, a fount of wisdom, the one person who knew the answers<br> to everything.<br><br> But Scarlett was wrong, for, years before, Ellen Robillard of<br> Savannah had giggled as inexplicably as any fifteen-year-old in<br> that charming coastal city and whispered the long nights through<br> with friends, exchanging confidences, telling all secrets but one.<br> That was the year when Gerald O'Hara, twenty-eight years older<br> than she, came into her life--the year, too, when youth and her<br> black-eyed cousin, Philippe Robillard, went out of it. For when<br> Philippe, with his snapping eyes and his wild ways, left Savannah<br> forever, he took with him the glow that was in Ellen's heart and<br> left for the bandy-legged little Irishman who married her only a<br> gentle shell.<br><br> But that was enough for Gerald, overwhelmed at his unbelievable<br> luck in actually marrying her. And if anything was gone from her,<br> he never missed it. Shrewd man that he was, he knew that it was<br> no less than a miracle that he, an Irishman with nothing of family<br> and wealth to recommend him, should win the daughter of one of the<br> wealthiest and proudest families on the Coast. For Gerald was a<br> self-made man.<br><br> <br><br> Gerald had come to America from Ireland when he was twenty-one.<br> He had come hastily, as many a better and worse Irishman before<br> and since, with the clothes he had on his back, two shillings<br> above his passage money and a price on his head that he felt was<br> larger than his misdeed warranted. There was no Orangeman this<br> side of hell worth a hundred pounds to the British government or<br> to the devil himself; but if the government felt so strongly about<br> the death of an English absentee landlord's rent agent, it was<br> time for Gerald O'Hara to be leaving and leaving suddenly. True,<br> he had called the rent agent ‘a bastard of an Orangeman,’ but<br> that, according to Gerald's way of looking at it, did not give the<br> man any right to insult him by whistling the opening bars of ‘The<br> Boyne Water.’<br><br> The Battle of the Boyne had been fought more than a hundred years<br> before, but, to the O'Haras and their neighbors, it might have<br> been yesterday when their hopes and their dreams, as well as their<br> lands and wealth, went off in the same cloud of dust that<br> enveloped a frightened and fleeing Stuart prince, leaving William<br> of Orange and his hated troops with their orange cockades to cut<br> down the Irish adherents of the Stuarts.<br><br> For this and other reasons, Gerald's family was not inclined to<br> view the fatal outcome of this quarrel as anything very serious,<br> except for the fact that it was charged with serious consequences.<br> For years, the O'Haras had been in bad odor with the English<br> constabulary on account of suspected activities against the<br> government, and Gerald was not the first O'Hara to take his foot<br> in his hand and quit Ireland between dawn and morning. His two<br> oldest brothers, James and Andrew, he hardly remembered, save as<br> close-lipped youths who came and went at odd hours of the night on<br> mysterious errands or disappeared for weeks at a time, to their<br> mother's gnawing anxiety. They had come to America years before,<br> after the discovery of a small arsenal of rifles buried under the<br> O'Hara pigsty. Now they were successful merchants in Savannah,<br> ‘though the dear God alone knows where that may be,’ as their<br> mother always interpolated when mentioning the two oldest of her<br> male brood, and it was to them that young Gerald was sent.<br><br> He left home with his mother's hasty kiss on his cheek and her<br> fervent Catholic blessing in his ears, and his father's parting<br> admonition, ‘Remember who ye are and don't be taking nothing off<br> no man.’ His five tall brothers gave him good-by with admiring<br> but slightly patronizing smiles, for Gerald was the baby and the<br> little one of a brawny family.<br><br> His five brothers and their father stood six feet and over and<br> broad in proportion, but little Gerald, at twenty-one, knew that<br> five feet four and a half inches was as much as the Lord in His<br> wisdom was going to allow him. It was like Gerald that he never<br> wasted regrets on his lack of height and never found it an<br> obstacle to his acquisition of anything he wanted. Rather, it was<br> Gerald's compact smallness that made him what he was, for he had<br> learned early that little people must be hardy to survive among<br> large ones. And Gerald was hardy.<br><br> His tall brothers were a grim, quiet lot, in whom the family<br> tradition of past glories, lost forever, rankled in unspoken hate<br> and crackled out in bitter humor. Had Gerald been brawny, he<br> would have gone the way of the other O'Haras and moved quietly and<br> darkly among the rebels against the government. But Gerald was<br> ‘loud-mouthed and bullheaded,’ as his mother fondly phrased it,<br> hair trigger of temper, quick with his fists and possessed of a<br> chip on his shoulder so large as to be almost visible to the naked<br> eye. He swaggered among the tall O'Haras like a strutting bantam<br> in a barnyard of giant Cochin roosters, and they loved him, baited<br> him affectionately to hear him roar and hammered on him with their<br> large fists no more than was necessary to keep a baby brother in<br> his proper place.<br><br> If the educational equipment which Gerald brought to America was<br> scant, he did not even know it. Nor would he have cared if he had<br> been told. His mother had taught him to read and to write a clear<br> hand. He was adept at ciphering. And there his book knowledge<br> stopped. The only Latin he knew was the responses of the Mass and<br> the only history the manifold wrongs of Ireland. He knew no<br> poetry save that of Moore and no music except the songs of Ireland<br> that had come down through the years. While he entertained the<br> liveliest respect for those who had more book learning than he, he<br> never felt his own lack. And what need had he of these things in<br> a new country where the most ignorant of bogtrotters had made<br> great fortunes? in this country which asked only that a man be<br> strong and unafraid of work?<br><br> Nor did James and Andrew, who took him into their store in<br> Savannah, regret his lack of education. His clear hand, his<br> accurate figures and his shrewd ability in bargaining won their<br> respect, where a knowledge of literature and a fine appreciation<br> of music, had young Gerald possessed them, would have moved them<br> to snorts of contempt. America, in the early years of the<br> century, had been kind to the Irish. James and Andrew, who had<br> begun by hauling goods in covered wagons from Savannah to<br> Georgia's inland towns, had prospered into a store of their own,<br> and Gerald prospered with them.<br><br> He liked the South, and he soon became, in his own opinion, a<br> Southerner. There was much about the South--and Southerners--that<br> he would never comprehend: but, with the wholeheartedness that was<br> his nature, he adopted its ideas and customs, as he understood<br> them, for his own--poker and horse racing, red-hot politics and<br> the code duello, States' Rights and damnation to all Yankees,<br> slavery and King Cotton, contempt for white trash and exaggerated<br> courtesy to women. He even learned to chew tobacco. There was no<br> need for him to acquire a good head for whisky, he had been born<br> with one.<br><br> But Gerald remained Gerald. His habits of living and his ideas<br> changed, but his manners he would not change, even had he been<br> able to change them. He admired the drawling elegance of the<br> wealthy rice and cotton planters, who rode into Savannah from<br> their moss-hung kingdoms, mounted on thoroughbred horses and<br> followed by the carriages of their equally elegant ladies and the<br> wagons of their slaves. But Gerald could never attain elegance.<br> Their lazy, blurred voices fell pleasantly on his ears, but his<br> own brisk brogue clung to his tongue. He liked the casual grace<br> with which they conducted affairs of importance, risking a fortune,<br> a plantation or a slave on the turn of a card and writing off their<br> losses with careless good humor and no more ado than when they<br> scattered pennies to pickaninnies. But Gerald had known poverty,<br> and he could never learn to lose money with good humor or good<br> grace. They were a pleasant race, these coastal Georgians, with<br> their soft-voiced, quick rages and their charming inconsistencies,<br> and Gerald liked them. But there was a brisk and restless vitality<br> about the young Irishman, fresh from a country where winds blew wet<br> and chill, where misty swamps held no fevers, that set him apart<br> from these indolent gentlefolk of semi-tropical weather and malarial<br> marshes.<br><br> From them he learned what he found useful, and the rest he<br> dismissed. He found poker the most useful of all Southern<br> customs, poker and a steady head for whisky; and it was his<br> natural aptitude for cards and amber liquor that brought to Gerald<br> two of his three most prized possessions, his valet and his<br> plantation. The other was his wife, and he could only attribute<br> her to the mysterious kindness of God.<br><br> The valet, Pork by name, shining black, dignified and trained in<br> all the arts of sartorial elegance, was the result of an all-night<br> poker game with a planter from St. Simons Island, whose courage in<br> a bluff equaled Gerald's but whose head for New Orleans rum did<br> not. Though Pork's former owner later offered to buy him back at<br> twice his value, Gerald obstinately refused, for the possession of<br> his first slave, and that slave the ‘best damn valet on the<br> Coast,’ was the first step upward toward his heart's desire,<br> Gerald wanted to be a slave owner and a landed gentleman.<br><br> His mind was made up that he was not going to spend all of his<br> days, like James and Andrew, in bargaining, or all his nights, by<br> candlelight, over long columns of figures. He felt keenly, as his<br> brothers did not, the social stigma attached to those ‘in trade.’<br> Gerald wanted to be a planter. With the deep hunger of an<br> Irishman who has been a tenant on the lands his people once had<br> owned and hunted, he wanted to see his own acres stretching green<br> before his eyes. With a ruthless singleness of purpose, he<br> desired his own house, his own plantation, his own horse, his own<br> slaves. And here in this new country, safe from the twin perils<br> of the land he had left--taxation that ate up crops and barns and<br> the ever-present threat of sudden confiscation--he intended to<br> have them. But having that ambition and bringing it to realization<br> were two different matters, he discovered as time went by. Coastal<br> Georgia was too firmly held by an entrenched aristocracy for him<br> ever to hope to win the place he intended to have.<br><br> Then the hand of Fate and a hand of poker combined to give him the<br> plantation which he afterwards called Tara, and at the same time<br> moved him out of the Coast into the upland country of north<br> Georgia.<br><br> It was in a saloon in Savannah, on a hot night in spring, when the<br> chance conversation of a stranger sitting near by made Gerald<br> prick up his ears. The stranger, a native of Savannah, had just<br> returned after twelve years in the inland country. He had been<br> one of the winners in the land lottery conducted by the State to<br> divide up the vast area in middle Georgia, ceded by the Indians<br> the year before Gerald came to America. He had gone up there and<br> established a plantation; but, now the house had burned down, he<br> was tired of the ‘accursed place’ and would be most happy to get<br> it off his hands.<br><br> Gerald, his mind never free of the thought of owning a plantation<br> of his own, arranged an introduction, and his interest grew as the<br> stranger told how the northern section of the state was filling up<br> with newcomers from the Carolinas and Virginia. Gerald had lived<br> in Savannah long enough to acquire a viewpoint of the Coast--that<br> all of the rest of the state was backwoods, with an Indian lurking<br> in every thicket. In transacting business for O'Hara Brothers, he<br> had visited Augusta, a hundred miles up the Savannah River, and he<br> had traveled inland far enough to visit the old towns westward<br> from that city. He knew that section to be as well settled as the<br> Coast, but from the stranger's description, his plantation was<br> more than two hundred and fifty miles inland from Savannah to the<br> north and west, and not many miles south of the Chattahoochee<br> River. Gerald knew that northward beyond that stream the land was<br> still held by the Cherokees, so it was with amazement that he<br> heard the stranger jeer at suggestions of trouble with the Indians<br> and narrate how thriving towns were growing up and plantations<br> prospering in the new country.<br><br> An hour later when the conversation began to lag, Gerald, with a<br> guile that belied the wide innocence of his bright blue eyes,<br> proposed a game. As the night wore on and the drinks went round,<br> there came a time when all the others in the game laid down their<br> hands and Gerald and the stranger were battling alone. The<br> stranger shoved in all his chips and followed with the deed to his<br> plantation. Gerald shoved in all his chips and laid on top of<br> them his wallet. If the money it contained happened to belong to<br> the firm of O'Hara Brothers, Gerald's conscience was not<br> sufficiently troubled to confess it before Mass the following<br> morning. He knew what he wanted, and when Gerald wanted something<br> he gained it by taking the most direct route. Moreover, such was<br> his faith in his destiny and four dueces that he never for a<br> moment wondered just how the money would be paid back should a<br> higher hand be laid down across the table.<br><br> ‘It's no bargain you're getting and I am glad not to have to pay<br> more taxes on the place,’ sighed the possessor of an ‘ace full,’<br> as he called for pen and ink. ‘The big house burned a year ago<br> and the fields are growing up in brush and seedling pine. But<br> it's yours.’<br><br> ‘Never mix cards and whisky unless you were weaned on Irish<br> poteen,’ Gerald told Pork gravely the same evening, as Pork<br> assisted him to bed. And the valet, who had begun to attempt a<br> brogue out of admiration for his new master, made requisite answer<br> in a combination of Geechee and County Meath that would have<br> puzzled anyone except those two alone.<br><br> The muddy Flint River, running silently between walls of pine and<br> water oak covered with tangled vines, wrapped about Gerald's new<br> land like a curving arm and embraced it on two sides. To Gerald,<br> standing on the small knoll where the house had been, this tall<br> barrier of green was as visible and pleasing an evidence of<br> ownership as though it were a fence that he himself had built to<br> mark his own. He stood on the blackened foundation stones of the<br> burned building, looked down the long avenue of trees leading<br> toward the road and swore lustily, with a joy too deep for<br> thankful prayer. These twin lines of somber trees were his, his<br> the abandoned lawn, waist high in weeds under white-starred young<br> magnolia trees. The uncultivated fields, studded with tiny pines<br> and underbrush, that stretched their rolling red-clay surface away<br> into the distance on four sides belonged to Gerald O'Hara--were<br> all his because he had an unbefuddled Irish head and the courage<br> to stake everything on a hand of cards.<br><br> Gerald closed his eyes and, in the stillness of the unworked<br> acres, he felt that he had come home. Here under his feet would<br> rise a house of whitewashed brick. Across the road would be new<br> rail fences, inclosing fat cattle and blooded horses, and the red<br> earth that rolled down the hillside to the rich river bottom land<br> would gleam white as eiderdown in the sun--cotton, acres and acres<br> of cotton! The fortunes of the O'Haras would rise again.<br><br> With his own small stake, what he could borrow from his<br> unenthusiastic brothers and a neat sum from mortgaging the land,<br> Gerald bought his first field hands and came to Tara to live in<br> bachelor solitude in the four-room overseer's house, till such a<br> time as the white walls of Tara should rise.<br><br> He cleared the fields and planted cotton and borrowed more money<br> from James and Andrew to buy more slaves. The O'Haras were a<br> clannish tribe, clinging to one another in prosperity as well as<br> in adversity, not for any overweening family affection but because<br> they had learned through grim years that to survive a family must<br> present an unbroken front to the world. They lent Gerald the<br> money and, in the years that followed, the money came back to them<br> with interest. Gradually the plantation widened out, as Gerald<br> bought more acres lying near him, and in time the white house<br> became a reality instead of a dream.<br><br> It was built by slave labor, a clumsy sprawling building that<br> crowned the rise of ground overlooking the green incline of<br> pasture land running down to the river; and it pleased Gerald<br> greatly, for, even when new, it wore a look of mellowed years.<br> The old oaks, which had seen Indians pass under their limbs,<br> hugged the house closely with their great trunks and towered their<br> branches over the roof in dense shade. The lawn, reclaimed from<br> weeds, grew thick with clover and Bermuda grass, and Gerald saw to<br> it that it was well kept. From the avenue of cedars to the row of<br> white cabins in the slave quarters, there was an air of solidness,<br> of stability and permanence about Tara, and whenever Gerald<br> galloped around the bend in the road and saw his own roof rising<br> through green branches, his heart swelled with pride as though<br> each sight of it were the first sight.<br><br> He had done it all, little, hard-headed, blustering Gerald.<br><br> Gerald was on excellent terms with all his neighbors in the<br> County, except the MacIntoshes whose land adjoined his on the left<br> and the Slatterys whose meager three acres stretched on his right<br> along the swamp bottoms between the river and John Wilkes'<br> plantation.<br><br> The MacIntoshes were Scotch-Irish and Orangemen and, had they<br> possessed all the saintly qualities of the Catholic calendar, this<br> ancestry would have damned them forever in Gerald's eyes. True,<br> they had lived in Georgia for seventy years and, before that, had<br> spent a generation in the Carolinas; but the first of the family<br> who set foot on American shores had come from Ulster, and that was<br> enough for Gerald.<br><br> They were a close-mouthed and stiff-necked family, who kept<br> strictly to themselves and intermarried with their Carolina<br> relatives, and Gerald was not alone in disliking them, for the<br> County people were neighborly and sociable and none too tolerant<br> of anyone lacking in those same qualities. Rumors of Abolitionist<br> sympathies did not enhance the popularity of the MacIntoshes. Old<br> Angus had never manumitted a single slave and had committed the<br> unpardonable social breach of selling some of his negroes to<br> passing slave traders en route to the cane fields of Louisiana,<br> but the rumors persisted.<br><br> ‘He's an Abolitionist, no doubt,’ observed Gerald to John Wilkes.<br> ‘But, in an Orangeman, when a principle comes up against Scotch<br> tightness, the principle fares ill.’<br><br> The Slatterys were another affair. Being poor white, they were<br> not even accorded the grudging respect that Angus MacIntosh's dour<br> independence wrung from neighboring families. Old Slattery, who<br> clung persistently to his few acres, in spite of repeated offers<br> from Gerald and John Wilkes, was shiftless and whining. His wife<br> was a snarly-haired woman, sickly and washed-out of appearance,<br> the mother of a brood of sullen and rabbity-looking children--<br> a brood which was increased regularly every year. Tom Slattery<br> owned no slaves, and he and his two oldest boys spasmodically<br> worked their few acres of cotton, while the wife and younger<br> children tended what was supposed to be a vegetable garden. But,<br> somehow, the cotton always failed, and the garden, due to Mrs.<br> Slattery's constant childbearing, seldom furnished enough to feed<br> her flock.<br><br> The sight of Tom Slattery dawdling on his neighbors' porches,<br> begging cotton seed for planting or a side of bacon to ‘tide him<br> over,’ was a familiar one. Slattery hated his neighbors with what<br> little energy he possessed, sensing their contempt beneath their<br> courtesy, and especially did he hate ‘rich folks' uppity niggers.’<br> The house negroes of the County considered themselves superior to<br> white trash, and their unconcealed scorn stung him, while their<br> more secure position in life stirred his envy. By contrast with<br> his own miserable existence, they were well-fed, well-clothed and<br> looked after in sickness and old age. They were proud of the good<br> names of their owners and, for the most part, proud to belong to<br> people who were quality, while he was despised by all.<br><br> Tom Slattery could have sold his farm for three times its value to<br> any of the planters in the County. They would have considered it<br> money well spent to rid the community of an eyesore, but he was<br> well satisfied to remain and to subsist miserably on the proceeds<br> of a bale of cotton a year and the charity of his neighbors.<br><br> With all the rest of the County, Gerald was on terms of amity and<br> some intimacy. The Wilkeses, the Calverts, the Tarletons, the<br> Fontaines, all smiled when the small figure on the big white horse<br> galloped up their driveways, smiled and signaled for tall glasses<br> in which a pony of Bourbon had been poured over a teaspoon of<br> sugar and a sprig of crushed mint. Gerald was likable, and the<br> neighbors learned in time what the children, negroes and dogs<br> discovered at first sight, that a kind heart, a ready and<br> sympathetic ear and an open pocketbook lurked just behind his<br> bawling voice and his truculent manner.<br><br> His arrival was always amid a bedlam of hounds barking and small<br> black children shouting as they raced to meet him, quarreling for<br> the privilege of holding his horse and squirming and grinning<br> under his good-natured insults. The white children clamored to<br> sit on his knee and be trotted, while he denounced to their elders<br> the infamy of Yankee politicians; the daughters of his friends<br> took him into their confidence about their love affairs, and the<br> youths of the neighborhood, fearful of confessing debts of honor<br> upon the carpets of their fathers, found him a friend in need.<br><br> ‘So, you've been owning this for a month, you young rascal!’ he<br> would shout. ‘And, in God's name, why haven't you been asking me<br> for the money before this?’<br><br> His rough manner of speech was too well known to give offense, and<br> it only made the young men grin sheepishly and reply: ‘Well, sir,<br> I hated to trouble you, and my father--’<br><br> ‘Your father's a good man, and no denying it, but strict, and so<br> take this and let's be hearing no more of it.’<br><br> The planters' ladies were the last to capitulate. But, when Mrs.<br> Wilkes, ‘a great lady and with a rare gift for silence,’ as Gerald<br> characterized her, told her husband one evening, after Gerald's<br> horse had pounded down the driveway. ‘He has a rough tongue, but<br> he is a gentleman,’ Gerald had definitely arrived.<br><br> He did not know that he had taken nearly ten years to arrive, for<br> it never occurred to him that his neighbors had eyed him askance<br> at first. In his own mind, there had never been any doubt that he<br> belonged, from the moment he first set foot on Tara.<br><br> When Gerald was forty-three, so thickset of body and florid of<br> face that he looked like a hunting squire out of a sporting print,<br> it came to him that Tara, dear though it was, and the County folk,<br> with their open hearts and open houses, were not enough. He<br> wanted a wife.<br><br> Tara cried out for a mistress. The fat cook, a yard negro<br> elevated by necessity to the kitchen, never had the meals on time,<br> and the chambermaid, formerly a field hand, let dust accumulate on<br> the furniture and never seemed to have clean linen on hand, so<br> that the arrival of guests was always the occasion of much<br> stirring and to-do. Pork, the only trained house negro on the<br> place, had general supervision over the other servants, but even<br> he had grown slack and careless after several years of exposure to<br> Gerald's happy-go-lucky mode of living. As valet, he kept<br> Gerald's bedroom in order, and, as butler, he served the meals<br> with dignity and style, but otherwise he pretty well let matters<br> follow their own course.<br><br> With unerring African instinct, the negroes had all discovered<br> that Gerald had a loud bark and no bite at all, and they took<br> shameless advantage of him. The air was always thick with threats<br> of selling slaves south and of direful whippings, but there never<br> had been a slave sold from Tara and only one whipping, and that<br> administered for not grooming down Gerald's pet horse after a long<br> day's hunting.<br><br> Gerald's sharp blue eyes noticed how efficiently his neighbors'<br> houses were run and with what ease the smooth-haired wives in<br> rustling skirts managed their servants. He had no knowledge of<br> the dawn-till-midnight activities of these women, chained to<br> supervision of cooking, nursing, sewing and laundering. He only<br> saw the outward results, and those results impressed him.<br><br> The urgent need of a wife became clear to him one morning when he<br> was dressing to ride to town for Court Day. Pork brought forth<br> his favorite ruffled shirt, so inexpertly mended by the<br> chambermaid as to be unwearable by anyone except his valet.<br><br> ‘Mist' Gerald,’ said Pork, gratefully rolling up the shirt as<br> Gerald fumed, ‘whut you needs is a wife, and a wife whut has got<br> plen'y of house niggers.’<br><br> Gerald upbraided Pork for his impertinence, but he knew that he<br> was right. He wanted a wife and he wanted children and, if he did<br> not acquire them soon, it would be too late. But he was not going<br> to marry just anyone, as Mr. Calvert had done, taking to wife the<br> Yankee governess of his motherless children. His wife must be a<br> lady and a lady of blood, with as many airs and graces as Mrs.<br> Wilkes and the ability to manage Tara as well as Mrs. Wilkes<br> ordered her own domain.<br><br> But there were two difficulties in the way of marriage into the<br> County families. The first was the scarcity of girls of<br> marriageable age. The second, and more serious one, was that<br> Gerald was a ‘new man,’ despite his nearly ten years' residence,<br> and a foreigner. No one knew anything about his family. While<br> the society of up-country Georgia was not so impregnable as that<br> of the Coast aristocrats, no family wanted a daughter to wed a man<br> about whose grandfather nothing was known.<br><br> Gerald knew that despite the genuine liking of the County men with<br> whom he hunted, drank and talked politics there was hardly one<br> whose daughter he could marry. And he did not intend to have it<br> gossiped about over supper tables that this, that or the other<br> father had regretfully refused to let Gerald O'Hara pay court to<br> his daughter. This knowledge did not make Gerald feel inferior to<br> his neighbors. Nothing could ever make Gerald feel that he was<br> inferior in any way to anyone. It was merely a quaint custom of<br> the County that daughters only married into families who had lived<br> in the South much longer than twenty-two years, had owned land and<br> slaves and been addicted only to the fashionable vices during that<br> time.<br><br> ‘Pack up. We're going to Savannah,’ he told Pork. ‘And if I hear<br> you say 'Whist!' or 'Faith!' but once, it's selling you I'll be<br> doing, for they are words I seldom say meself.’<br><br> James and Andrew might have some advice to offer on this subject<br> of marriage, and there might be daughters among their old friends<br> who would both meet his requirements and find him acceptable as a<br> husband. James and Andrew listened to his story patiently but<br> they gave him little encouragement. They had no Savannah<br> relatives to whom they might look for assistance, for they had<br> been married when they came to America. And the daughters of<br> their old friends had long since married and were raising small<br> children of their own.<br><br> ‘You're not a rich man and you haven't a great family,’ said<br> James.<br><br> ‘I've made me money and I can make a great family. And I won't be<br> marrying just anyone.’<br><br> ‘You fly high,’ observed Andrew, dryly.<br><br> But they did their best for Gerald. James and Andrew were old men<br> and they stood well in Savannah. They had many friends, and for a<br> month they carried Gerald from home to home, to suppers, dances<br> and picnics.<br><br> ‘There's only one who takes me eye,’ Gerald said finally. ‘And<br> she not even born when I landed here.’<br><br> ‘And who is it takes your eye?’<br><br> ‘Miss Ellen Robillard,’ said Gerald, trying to speak casually, for<br> the slightly tilting dark eyes of Ellen Robillard had taken more<br> than his eye. Despite a mystifying listlessness of manner, so<br> strange in a girl of fifteen, she charmed him. Moreover, there<br> was a haunting look of despair about her that went to his heart<br> and made him more gentle with her than he had ever been with any<br> person in all the world.<br><br> ‘And you old enough to be her father!’<br><br> ‘And me in me prime!’ cried Gerald stung.<br><br> James spoke gently.<br><br> ‘Jerry, there's no girl in Savannah you'd have less chance of<br> marrying. Her father is a Robillard, and those French are proud<br> as Lucifer. And her mother--God rest her soul--was a very great<br> lady.’<br><br> ‘I care not,’ said Gerald heatedly. ‘Besides, her mother is dead,<br> and old man Robillard likes me.’<br><br> ‘As a man, yes, but as a son-in-law, no.’<br><br> ‘The girl wouldn't have you anyway,’ interposed Andrew. ‘She's<br> been in love with that wild buck of a cousin of hers, Philippe<br> Robillard, for a year now, despite her family being at her morning<br> and night to give him up.’<br><br> ‘He's been gone to Louisiana this month now,’ said Gerald.<br><br> ‘And how do you know?’<br><br> ‘I know,’ answered Gerald, who did not care to disclose that Pork<br> had supplied this valuable bit of information, or that Philippe<br> had departed for the West at the express desire of his family.<br> ‘And I do not think she's been so much in love with him that she<br> won't forget him. Fifteen is too young to know much about love.’<br><br> ‘They'd rather have that breakneck cousin for her than you.’<br><br> So, James and Andrew were as startled as anyone when the news came<br> out that the daughter of Pierre Robillard was to marry the little<br> Irishman from up the country. Savannah buzzed behind its doors<br> and speculated about Philippe Robillard, who had gone West, but<br> the gossiping brought no answer. Why the loveliest of the<br> Robillard daughters should marry a loud-voiced, red-faced little<br> man who came hardly up to her ears remained a mystery to all.<br><br> Gerald himself never quite knew how it all came about. He only<br> knew that a miracle had happened. And, for once in his life, he<br> was utterly humble when Ellen, very white but very calm, put a<br> light hand on his arm and said: ‘I will marry you, Mr. O'Hara.’<br><br> The thunderstruck Robillards knew the answer in part, but only<br> Ellen and her mammy ever knew the whole story of the night when<br> the girl sobbed till the dawn like a broken-hearted child and rose<br> up in the morning a woman with her mind made up.<br><br> With foreboding, Mammy had brought her young mistress a small<br> package, addressed in a strange hand from New Orleans, a package<br> containing a miniature of Ellen, which she flung to the floor with<br> a cry, four letters in her own handwriting to Philippe Robillard,<br> and a brief letter from a New Orleans priest, announcing the death<br> of her cousin in a barroom brawl.<br><br> ‘They drove him away, Father and Pauline and Eulalie. They drove<br> him away. I hate them. I hate them all. I never want to see<br> them again. I want to get away. I will go away where I'll never<br> see them again, or this town, or anyone who reminds me of--of--<br> him.’<br><br> And when the night was nearly spent, Mammy, who had cried herself<br> out over her mistress' dark head, protested, ‘But, honey, you kain<br> do dat!’<br><br> ‘I will do it. He is a kind man. I will do it or go into the<br> convent at Charleston.’<br><br> It was the threat of the convent that finally won the assent of<br> bewildered and heartstricken Pierre Robillard. He was staunchly<br> Presbyterian, even though his family were Catholic, and the<br> thought of his daughter becoming a nun was even worse than that of<br> her marrying Gerald O'Hara. After all, the man had nothing<br> against him but a lack of family.<br><br> So, Ellen, no longer Robillard, turned her back on Savannah, never<br> to see it again, and with a middle-aged husband, Mammy, and twenty<br> ‘house niggers’ journeyed toward Tara.<br><br> The next year, their first child was born and they named her Katie<br> Scarlett, after Gerald's mother. Gerald was disappointed, for he<br> had wanted a son, but he nevertheless was pleased enough over his<br> small black-haired daughter to serve rum to every slave at Tara<br> and to get roaringly, happily drunk himself.<br><br> If Ellen had ever regretted her sudden decision to marry him, no<br> one ever knew it, certainly not Gerald, who almost burst with<br> pride whenever he looked at her. She had put Savannah and its<br> memories behind her when she left that gently mannered city by the<br> sea, and, from the moment of her arrival in the County, north<br> Georgia was her home.<br><br> When she departed from her father's house forever, she had left a<br> home whose lines were as beautiful and flowing as a woman's body,<br> as a ship in full sail; a pale pink stucco house built in the<br> French colonial style, set high from the ground in a dainty<br> manner, approached by swirling stairs, banistered with wrought<br> iron as delicate as lace; a dim, rich house, gracious but aloof.<br><br> She had left not only that graceful dwelling but also the entire<br> civilization that was behind the building of it, and she found<br> herself in a world that was as strange and different as if she had<br> crossed a continent.<br><br> Here in north Georgia was a rugged section held by a hardy people.<br> High up on the plateau at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains,<br> she saw rolling red hills wherever she looked, with huge<br> outcroppings of the underlying granite and gaunt pines towering<br> somberly everywhere. It all seemed wild and untamed to her coast-<br> bred eyes accustomed to the quiet jungle beauty of the sea islands<br> draped in their gray moss and tangled green, the white stretches<br> of beach hot beneath a semitropic sun, the long flat vistas of<br> sandy land studded with palmetto and palm.<br><br> This was a section that knew the chill of winter, as well as the<br> heat of summer, and there was a vigor and energy in the people<br> that was strange to her. They were a kindly people, courteous,<br> generous, filled with abounding good nature, but sturdy, virile,<br> easy to anger. The people of the Coast which she had left might<br> pride themselves on taking all their affairs, even their duels and<br> their feuds, with a careless air but these north Georgia people<br> had a streak of violence in them. On the coast, life had<br> mellowed--here it was young and lusty and new.<br><br> All the people Ellen had known in Savannah might have been cast<br> from the same mold, so similar were their view points and<br> traditions, but here was a variety of people. North Georgia's<br> settlers were coming in from many different places, from other<br> parts of Georgia, from the Carolinas and Virginia, from Europe and<br> the North. Some of them, like Gerald, were new people seeking<br> their fortunes. Some, like Ellen, were members of old families<br> who had found life intolerable in their former homes and sought<br> haven in a distant land. Many had moved for no reason at all,<br> except that the restless blood of pioneering fathers still<br> quickened in their veins.<br><br> These people, drawn from many different places and with many<br> different backgrounds, gave the whole life of the County an<br> informality that was new to Ellen, an informality to which she<br> never quite accustomed herself. She instinctively knew how Coast<br> people would act in any circumstance. There was never any telling<br> what north Georgians would do.<br><br> And, quickening all of the affairs of the section, was the high<br> tide of prosperity then rolling over the South. All of the world<br> was crying out for cotton, and the new land of the County, unworn<br> and fertile, produced it abundantly. Cotton was the heartbeat of<br> the section, the planting and the picking were the diastole and<br> systole of the red earth. Wealth came out of the curving furrows,<br> and arrogance came too--arrogance built on green bushes and the<br> acres of fleecy white. If cotton could make them rich in one<br> generation, how much richer they would be in the next!<br><br> This certainty of the morrow gave zest and enthusiasm to life, and<br> the County people enjoyed life with a heartiness that Ellen could<br> never understand. They had money enough and slaves enough to give<br> them time to play, and they liked to play. They seemed never too<br> busy to drop work for a fish fry, a hunt or a horse race, and<br> scarcely a week went by without its barbecue or ball.<br><br> Ellen never would, or could, quite become one of them--she had<br> left too much of herself in Savannah--but she respected them and,<br> in time, learned to admire the frankness and forthrightness of<br> these people, who had few reticences and who valued a man for what<br> he was.<br><br> She became the best-loved neighbor in the County. She was a<br> thrifty and kind mistress, a good mother and a devoted wife. The<br> heartbreak and selflessness that she would have dedicated to the<br> Church were devoted instead to the service of her child, her<br> household and the man who had taken her out of Savannah and its<br> memories and had never asked any questions.<br><br> When Scarlett was a year old, and more healthy and vigorous than a<br> girl baby had any right to be, in Mammy's opinion, Ellen's second<br> child, named Susan Elinor, but always called Suellen, was born,<br> and in due time came Carreen, listed in the family Bible as<br> Caroline Irene. Then followed three little boys, each of whom<br> died before he had learned to walk--three little boys who now lay<br> under the twisted cedars in the burying ground a hundred yards<br> from the house, beneath three stones, each bearing the name of<br> ‘Gerald O'Hara, Jr.’<br><br> From the day when Ellen first came to Tara, the place had been<br> transformed. If she was only fifteen years old, she was<br> nevertheless ready for the responsibilities of the mistress of a<br> plantation. Before marriage, young girls must be, above all other<br> things, sweet, gentle, beautiful and ornamental, but, after<br> marriage, they were expected to manage households that numbered a<br> hundred people or more, white and black, and they were trained<br> with that in view.<br><br> Ellen had been given this preparation for marriage which any well-<br> brought-up young lady received, and she also had Mammy, who could<br> galvanize the most shiftless negro into energy. She quickly<br> brought order, dignity and grace into Gerald's household, and she<br> gave Tara a beauty it had never had before.<br><br> The house had been built according to no architectural plan<br> whatever, with extra rooms added where and when it seemed<br> convenient, but, with Ellen's care and attention, it gained a<br> charm that made up for its lack of design. The avenue of cedars<br> leading from the main road to the house--that avenue of cedars<br> without which no Georgia planter's home could be complete--had a<br> cool dark shadiness that gave a brighter tinge, by contrast, to<br> the green of the other trees. The wistaria tumbling over the<br> verandas showed bright against the whitewashed brick, and it<br> joined with the pink crepe myrtle bushes by the door and the<br> white-blossomed magnolias in the yard to disguise some of the<br> awkward lines of the house.<br><br> In spring time and summer, the Bermuda grass and clover on the<br> lawn became emerald, so enticing an emerald that it presented an<br> irresistible temptation to the flocks of turkeys and white geese<br> that were supposed to roam only the regions in the rear of the<br> house. The elders of the flocks continually led stealthy advances<br> into the front yard, lured on by the green of the grass and the<br> luscious promise of the cape jessamine buds and the zinnia beds.<br> Against their depredations, a small black sentinel was stationed<br> on the front porch. Armed with a ragged towel, the little negro<br> boy sitting on the steps was part of the picture of Tara--and an<br> unhappy one, for he was forbidden to chunk the fowls and could<br> only flap the towel at them and shoo them.<br><br> Ellen set dozens of little black boys to this task, the first<br> position of responsibility a male slave had at Tara. After they<br> had passed their tenth year, they were sent to old Daddy the<br> plantation cobbler to learn his trade, or to Amos the wheelwright<br> and carpenter, or Philip the cow man, or Cuffee the mule boy. If<br> they showed no aptitude for any of these trades, they became field<br> hands and, in the opinion of the negroes, they had lost their<br> claim to any social standing at all.<br><br> Ellen's life was not easy, nor was it happy, but she did not<br> expect life to be easy, and, if it was not happy, that was woman's<br> lot. It was a man's world, and she accepted it as such. The man<br> owned the property, and the woman managed it. The man took the<br> credit for the management, and the woman praised his cleverness.<br> The man roared like a bull when a splinter was in his finger, and<br> the woman muffled the moans of childbirth, lest she disturb him.<br> Men were rough of speech and often drunk. Women ignored the<br> lapses of speech and put the drunkards to bed without bitter<br> words. Men were rude and outspoken, women were always kind,<br> gracious and forgiving.<br><br> She had been reared in the tradition of great ladies, which had<br> taught her how to carry her burden and still retain her charm, and<br> she intended that her three daughters should be great ladies also.<br> With her younger daughters, she had success, for Suellen was so<br> anxious to be attractive she lent an attentive and obedient ear to<br> her mother's teachings, and Carreen was shy and easily led. But<br> Scarlett, child of Gerald, found the road to ladyhood hard.<br><br> To Mammy's indignation, her preferred playmates were not her<br> demure sisters or the well-brought-up Wilkes girls but the negro<br> children on the plantation and the boys of the neighborhood, and<br> she could climb a tree or throw a rock as well as any of them.<br> Mammy was greatly perturbed that Ellen's daughter should display<br> such traits and frequently adjured her to ‘ack lak a lil lady.’<br> But Ellen took a more tolerant and long-sighted view of the<br> matter. She knew that from childhood playmates grew beaux in<br> later years, and the first duty of a girl was to get married. She<br> told herself that the child was merely full of life and there was<br> still time in which to teach her the arts and graces of being<br> attractive to men.<br><br> To this end, Ellen and Mammy bent their efforts, and as Scarlett<br> grew older she became an apt pupil in this subject, even though<br> she learned little else. Despite a succession of governesses and<br> two years at the near-by Fayetteville Female Academy, her<br> education was sketchy, but no girl in the County danced more<br> gracefully than she. She knew how to smile so that her dimples<br> leaped, how to walk pigeon-toed so that her wide hoop skirts<br> swayed entrancingly, how to look up into a man's face and then<br> drop her eyes and bat the lids rapidly so that she seemed a-<br> tremble with gentle emotion. Most of all she learned how to<br> conceal from men a sharp intelligence beneath a face as sweet and<br> bland as a baby's.<br><br> Ellen, by soft-voiced admonition, and Mammy, by constant carping,<br> labored to inculcate in her the qualities that would make her<br> truly desirable as a wife.<br><br> ‘You must be more gentle, dear, more sedate,’ Ellen told her<br> daughter. ‘You must not interrupt gentlemen when they are<br> speaking, even if you do think you know more about matters than<br> they do. Gentlemen do not like forward girls.’<br><br> ‘Young misses whut frowns an pushes out dey chins an' says 'Ah<br> will' and 'Ah woan' mos' gener'ly doan ketch husbands,’ prophesied<br> Mammy gloomily. ‘Young misses should cas' down dey eyes an' say,<br> 'Well, suh, Ah mout' an' 'Jes' as you say, suh.'‘<br><br> Between them, they taught her all that a gentlewoman should know,<br> but she learned only the outward signs of gentility. The inner<br> grace from which these signs should spring, she never learned nor<br> did she see any reason for learning it. Appearances were enough,<br> for the appearances of ladyhood won her popularity and that was<br> all she wanted. Gerald bragged that she was the belle of five<br> counties, and with some truth, for she had received proposals from<br> nearly all the young men in the neighborhood and many from places<br> as far away as Atlanta and Savannah.<br><br> At sixteen, thanks to Mammy and Ellen, she looked sweet, charming<br> and giddy, but she was, in reality, self-willed, vain and<br> obstinate. She had the easily stirred passions of her Irish<br> father and nothing except the thinnest veneer of her mother's<br> unselfish and forbearing nature. Ellen never fully realized that<br> it was only a veneer, for Scarlett always showed her best face to<br> her mother, concealing her escapades, curbing her temper and<br> appearing as sweet-natured as she could in Ellen's presence, for<br> her mother could shame her to tears with a reproachful glance.<br><br> But Mammy was under no illusions about her and was constantly<br> alert for breaks in the veneer. Mammy's eyes were sharper than<br> Ellen's, and Scarlett could never recall in all her life having<br> fooled Mammy for long.<br><br> It was not that these two loving mentors deplored Scarlett's high<br> spirits, vivacity and charm. These were traits of which Southern<br> women were proud. It was Gerald's headstrong and impetuous nature<br> in her that gave them concern, and they sometimes feared they<br> would not be able to conceal her damaging qualities until she had<br> made a good match. But Scarlett intended to marry--and marry<br> Ashley--and she was willing to appear demure, pliable and<br> scatterbrained, if those were the qualities that attracted men.<br> Just why men should be this way, she did not know. She only knew<br> that such methods worked. It never interested her enough to try<br> to think out the reason for it, for she knew nothing of the inner<br> workings of any human being's mind, not even her own. She knew<br> only that if she did or said thus-and-so, men would unerringly<br> respond with the complementary thus-and-so. It was like a<br> mathematical formula and no more difficult, for mathematics was<br> the one subject that had come easy to Scarlett in her schooldays.<br><br> If she knew little about men's minds, she knew even less about the<br> minds of women, for they interested her less. She had never had a<br> girl friend, and she never felt any lack on that account. To her,<br> all women, including her two sisters, were natural enemies in<br> pursuit of the same prey--man.<br><br> All women with the one exception of her mother.<br><br> Ellen O'Hara was different, and Scarlett regarded her as something<br> holy and apart from all the rest of humankind. When Scarlett was<br> a child, she had confused her mother with the Virgin Mary, and now<br> that she was older she saw no reason for changing her opinion. To<br> her, Ellen represented the utter security that only Heaven or a<br> mother can give. She knew that her mother was the embodiment of<br> justice, truth, loving tenderness and profound wisdom--a great<br> lady.<br><br> Scarlett wanted very much to be like her mother. The only<br> difficulty was that by being just and truthful and tender and<br> unselfish, one missed most of the joys of life, and certainly many<br> beaux. And life was too short to miss such pleasant things. Some<br> day when she was married to Ashley and old, some day when she had<br> time for it, she intended to be like Ellen. But, until then . . .<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER IV<br><br> <br> That night at supper, Scarlett went through the motions of<br> presiding over the table in her mother's absence, but her mind was<br> in a ferment over the dreadful news she had heard about Ashley and<br> Melanie. Desperately she longed for her mother's return from the<br> Slatterys', for, without her, she felt lost and alone. What right<br> had the Slatterys and their everlasting sickness to take Ellen<br> away from home just at this time when she, Scarlett, needed her so<br> much?<br><br> Throughout the dismal meal, Gerald's booming voice battered<br> against her ears until she thought she could endure it no longer.<br> He had forgotten completely about his conversation with her that<br> afternoon and was carrying on a monologue about the latest news<br> from Fort Sumter, which he punctuated by hammering his fist on the<br> table and waving his arms in the air. Gerald made a habit of<br> dominating the conversation at mealtimes, and usually Scarlett,<br> occupied with her own thoughts, scarcely heard him; but tonight<br> she could not shut out his voice, no matter how much she strained<br> to listen for the sound of carriage wheels that would herald<br> Ellen's return.<br><br> Of course, she did not intend to tell her mother what was so heavy<br> on her heart, for Ellen would be shocked and grieved to know that<br> a daughter of hers wanted a man who was engaged to another girl.<br> But, in the depths of the first tragedy she had ever known, she<br> wanted the very comfort of her mother's presence. She always felt<br> secure when Ellen was by her, for there was nothing so bad that<br> Ellen could not better it, simply by being there.<br><br> She rose suddenly from her chair at the sound of creaking wheels<br> in the driveway and then sank down again as they went on around<br> the house to the back yard. It could not be Ellen, for she would<br> alight at the front steps. Then there was an excited babble of<br> negro voices in the darkness of the yard and high-pitched negro<br> laughter. Looking out the window, Scarlett saw Pork, who had left<br> the room a moment before, holding high a flaring pine knot, while<br> indistinguishable figures descended from a wagon. The laughter<br> and talking rose and fell in the dark night air, pleasant, homely,<br> carefree sounds, gutturally soft, musically shrill. Then feet<br> shuffled up the back-porch stairs and into the passageway leading<br> to the main house, stopping in the hall just outside the dining<br> room. There was a brief interval of whispering, and Pork entered,<br> his usual dignity gone, his eyes rolling and his teeth a-gleam.<br><br> ‘Mist' Gerald,’ he announced, breathing hard, the pride of a<br> bridegroom all over his shining face, ‘you' new 'oman done come.’<br><br> ‘New woman? I didn't buy any new woman,’ declared Gerald,<br> pretending to glare.<br><br> ‘Yassah, you did, Mist' Gerald! Yassah! An' she out hyah now<br> wanting ter speak wid you,’ answered Pork, giggling and twisting<br> his hands in excitement.<br><br> ‘Well, bring in the bride,’ said Gerald, and Pork, turning,<br> beckoned into the hall to his wife, newly arrived from the Wilkes<br> plantation to become part of the household of Tara. She entered,<br> and behind her, almost hidden by her voluminous calico skirts,<br> came her twelve-year-old daughter, squirming against her mother's<br> legs.<br><br> Dilcey was tall and bore herself erectly. She might have been any<br> age from thirty to sixty, so unlined was her immobile bronze face.<br> Indian blood was plain in her features, overbalancing the negroid<br> characteristics. The red color of her skin, narrow high forehead,<br> prominent cheek bones and the hawk-bridged nose which flattened at<br> the end above thick negro lips, all showed the mixture of two<br> races. She was self-possessed and walked with a dignity that<br> surpassed even Mammy's, for Mammy had acquired her dignity and<br> Dilcey's was in her blood.<br><br> When she spoke, her voice was not so slurred as most negroes' and<br> she chose her words more carefully.<br><br> ‘Good evenin', young Misses. Mist' Gerald, I is sorry to 'sturb<br> you, but I wanted to come here and thank you agin fo' buyin' me<br> and my chile. Lots of gentlemens might a' bought me but they<br> wouldn't a' bought my Prissy, too, jes' to keep me frum grievin'<br> and I thanks you. I'm gwine do my bes' fo' you and show you I<br> ain't forgettin'.’<br><br> ‘Hum--hurrump,’ said Gerald, clearing his throat in embarrassment<br> at being caught openly in an act of kindness.<br><br> Dilcey turned to Scarlett and something like a smile wrinkled the<br> corners of her eyes. ‘Miss Scarlett, Poke done tole me how you<br> ast Mist Gerald to buy me. And so I'm gwine give you my Prissy<br> fo' yo' own maid.’<br><br> She reached behind her and jerked the little girl forward. She<br> was a brown little creature, with skinny legs like a bird and a<br> myriad of pigtails carefully wrapped with twine sticking stiffly<br> out from her head. She had sharp, knowing eyes that missed<br> nothing and a studiedly stupid look on her face.<br><br> ‘Thank you, Dilcey,’ Scarlett replied, ‘but I'm afraid Mammy will<br> have something to say about that. She's been my maid ever since I<br> was born.’<br><br> ‘Mammy getting ole,’ said Dilcey, with a calmness that would have<br> enraged Mammy. ‘She a good mammy, but you a young lady now and<br> needs a good maid, and my Prissy been maidin' fo' Miss India fo' a<br> year now. She kin sew and fix hair good as a grown pusson.’<br><br> Prodded by her mother, Prissy bobbed a sudden curtsy and grinned<br> at Scarlett, who could not help grinning back.<br><br> ‘A sharp little wench,’ she thought, and said aloud: ‘Thank you,<br> Dilcey, we'll see about it when Mother comes home.’<br><br> ‘Thankee, Ma'm. I gives you a good night,’ said Dilcey and,<br> turning, left the room with her child, Pork dancing attendance.<br> The supper things cleared away, Gerald resumed his oration, but<br> with little satisfaction to himself and none at all to his<br> audience. His thunderous predictions of immediate war and his<br> rhetorical questions as to whether the South would stand for<br> further insults from the Yankees only produced faintly bored,<br> ‘Yes, Papas’ and ‘No, Pas.’ Carreen, sitting on a hassock under<br> the big lamp, was deep in the romance of a girl who had taken the<br> veil after her lover's death and, with silent tears of enjoyment<br> oozing from her eyes, was pleasurably picturing herself in a white<br> coif. Suellen, embroidering on what she gigglingly called her<br> ‘hope chest,’ was wondering if she could possibly detach Stuart<br> Tarleton from her sister's side at the barbecue tomorrow and<br> fascinate him with the sweet womanly qualities which she possessed<br> and Scarlett did not. And Scarlett was in a tumult about Ashley.<br><br> How could Pa talk on and on about Fort Sumter and the Yankees when<br> he knew her heart was breaking? As usual in the very young, she<br> marveled that people could be so selfishly oblivious to her pain<br> and the world rock along just the same, in spite of her heartbreak.<br><br> Her mind was as if a cyclone had gone through it, and it seemed<br> strange that the dining room where they sat should be so placid,<br> so unchanged from what it had always been. The heavy mahogany<br> table and sideboards, the massive silver, the bright rag rugs on<br> the shining floor were all in their accustomed places, just as if<br> nothing had happened. It was a friendly and comfortable room and,<br> ordinarily, Scarlett loved the quiet hours which the family spent<br> there after supper; but tonight she hated the sight of it and, if<br> she had not feared her father's loudly bawled questions, she would<br> have slipped away, down the dark hall to Ellen's little office and<br> cried out her sorrow on the old sofa.<br><br> That was the room that Scarlett liked the best in all the house.<br> There, Ellen sat before her tall secretary each morning, keeping<br> the accounts of the plantation and listening to the reports of<br> Jonas Wilkerson, the overseer. There also the family idled while<br> Ellen's quill scratched across her ledgers. Gerald in the old<br> rocker, the girls on the sagging cushions of the sofa that was too<br> battered and worn for the front of the house. Scarlett longed to<br> be there now, alone with Ellen, so she could put her head in her<br> mother's lap and cry in peace. Wouldn't Mother ever come home?<br><br> Then, wheels ground sharply on the graveled driveway, and the soft<br> murmur of Ellen's voice dismissing the coachman floated into the<br> room. The whole group looked up eagerly as she entered rapidly,<br> her hoops swaying, her face tired and sad. There entered with her<br> the faint fragrance of lemon verbena sachet, which seemed always<br> to creep from the folds of her dresses, a fragrance that was<br> always linked in Scarlett's mind with her mother. Mammy followed<br> at a few paces, the leather bag in her hand, her underlip pushed<br> out and her brow lowering. Mammy muttered darkly to herself as<br> she waddled, taking care that her remarks were pitched too low to<br> be understood but loud enough to register her unqualified<br> disapproval.<br><br> ‘I am sorry I am so late,’ said Ellen, slipping her plaid shawl<br> from drooping shoulders and handing it to Scarlett, whose cheek<br> she patted in passing.<br><br> Gerald's face had brightened as if by magic at her entrance.<br><br> ‘Is the brat baptized?’ he questioned.<br><br> ‘Yes, and dead, poor thing,’ said Ellen. ‘I feared Emmie would<br> die too, but I think she will live.’<br><br> The girls' faces turned to her, startled and questioning, and<br> Gerald wagged his head philosophically.<br><br> ‘Well, 'tis better so that the brat is dead, no doubt, poor<br> fatherle--’<br><br> ‘It is late. We had better have prayers now,’ interrupted Ellen<br> so smoothly that, if Scarlett had not known her mother well, the<br> interruption would have passed unnoticed.<br><br> It would be interesting to know who was the father of Emmie<br> Slattery's baby, but Scarlett knew she would never learn the truth<br> of the matter if she waited to hear it from her mother. Scarlett<br> suspected Jonas Wilkerson, for she had frequently seen him walking<br> down the road with Emmie at nightfall. Jonas was a Yankee and a<br> bachelor, and the fact that he was an overseer forever barred him<br> from any contact with the County social life. There was no family<br> of any standing into which he could marry, no people with whom he<br> could associate except the Slatterys and riffraff like them. As<br> he was several cuts above the Slatterys in education, it was only<br> natural that he should not want to marry Emmie, no matter how<br> often he might walk with her in the twilight.<br><br> Scarlett sighed, for her curiosity was sharp. Things were always<br> happening under her mother's eyes which she noticed no more than<br> if they had not happened at all. Ellen ignored all things<br> contrary to her ideas of propriety and tried to teach Scarlett to<br> do the same, but with poor success.<br><br> Ellen had stepped to the mantel to take her rosary beads from the<br> small inlaid casket in which they always reposed when Mammy spoke<br> up with firmness.<br><br> ‘Miss Ellen, you gwine eat some supper befo' you does any<br> prayin'.’<br><br> ‘Thank you. Mammy, but I am not hungry.’<br><br> ‘Ah gwine fix yo' supper mahseff an' you eats it,’ said Mammy, her<br> brow furrowed with indignation as she started down the hall for<br> the kitchen. ‘Poke!’ she called, ‘tell Cookie stir up de fiah.<br> Miss Ellen home.’<br><br> As the boards shuddered under her weight, the soliloquy she had<br> been muttering in the front hall grew louder and louder, coming<br> clearly to the ears of the family in the dining room.<br><br> ‘Ah has said time an' again, it doan do no good doin' nuthin' fer<br> w'ite trash. Dey is de shiflesses, mos' ungrateful passel of no-<br> counts livin'. An' Miss Ellen got no bizness weahin' herseff out<br> waitin' on folks dat did dey be wuth shootin' dey'd have niggers<br> ter wait on dem. An' Ah has said--’<br><br> Her voice trailed off as she went down the long open passageway,<br> covered only by a roof, that led into the kitchen. Mammy had her<br> own method of letting her owners know exactly where she stood on<br> all matters. She knew it was beneath the dignity of quality white<br> folks to pay the slightest attention to what a darky said when she<br> was just grumbling to herself. She knew that to uphold this<br> dignity, they must ignore what she said, even if she stood in the<br> next room and almost shouted. It protected her from reproof, and<br> it left no doubt in anyone's mind as to her exact views on any<br> subject.<br><br> Pork entered the room, bearing a plate, silver and a napkin. He<br> was followed closely by Jack, a black little boy of ten, hastily<br> buttoning a white linen jacket with one hand and bearing in the<br> other a fly-swisher, made of thin strips of newspaper tied to a<br> reed longer than he was. Ellen had a beautiful peacock-feather<br> fly-brusher, but it was used only on very special occasions and<br> then only after domestic struggle, due to the obstinate conviction<br> of Pork, Cookie and Mammy that peacock feathers were bad luck.<br><br> Ellen sat down in the chair which Gerald pulled out for her and<br> four voices attacked her.<br><br> ‘Mother, the lace is loose on my new ball dress and I want to wear<br> it tomorrow night at Twelve Oaks. Won't you please fix it?’<br><br> ‘Mother, Scarlett's new dress is prettier than mine and I look<br> like a fright in pink. Why can't she wear my pink and let me wear<br> her green? She looks all right in pink.’<br><br> ‘Mother, can I stay up for the ball tomorrow night? I'm thirteen<br> now--’<br><br> ‘Mrs. O'Hara, would you believe it-- Hush, you girls, before I<br> take me crop to you! Cade Calvert was in Atlanta this morning and<br> he says--will you be quiet and let me be hearing me own voice?--<br> and he says it's all upset they are there and talking nothing but<br> war, militia drilling, troops forming. And he says the news from<br> Charleston is that they will be putting up with no more Yankee<br> insults.’<br><br> Ellen's tired mouth smiled into the tumult as she addressed<br> herself first to her husband, as a wife should.<br><br> ‘If the nice people of Charleston feel that way, I'm sure we will<br> all feel the same way soon,’ she said, for she had a deeply rooted<br> belief that, excepting only Savannah, most of the gentle blood of<br> the whole continent could be found in that small seaport city, a<br> belief shared largely by Charlestonians.<br><br> ‘No, Carreen, next year, dear. Then you can stay up for balls and<br> wear grown-up dresses, and what a good time my little pink cheeks<br> will have! Don't pout, dear. You can go to the barbecue,<br> remember that, and stay up through supper, but no balls until you<br> are fourteen.<br><br> ‘Give me your gown, Scarlett, I will whip the lace for you after<br> prayers.<br><br> ‘Suellen, I do not like your tone, dear. Your pink gown is lovely<br> and suitable to your complexion, Scarlett's is to hers. But you<br> may wear my garnet necklace tomorrow night.’<br><br> Suellen, behind her mother's hack, wrinkled her nose triumphantly<br> at Scarlett, who had been planning to beg the necklace for<br> herself. Scarlett put out her tongue at her. Suellen was an<br> annoying sister with her whining and selfishness, and had it not<br> been for Ellen's restraining hand, Scarlett would frequently have<br> boxed her ears.<br><br> ‘Now, Mr. O'Hara, tell me more about what Mr. Calvert said about<br> Charleston,’ said Ellen.<br><br> Scarlett knew her mother cared nothing at all about war and<br> politics and thought them masculine matters about which no lady<br> could intelligently concern herself. But it gave Gerald pleasure<br> to air his views, and Ellen was unfailingly thoughtful of her<br> husband's pleasure.<br><br> While Gerald launched forth on his news, Mammy set the plates<br> before her mistress, golden-topped biscuits, breast of fried<br> chicken and a yellow yam open and steaming, with melted butter<br> dripping from it. Mammy pinched small Jack, and he hastened to<br> his business of slowly swishing the paper ribbons back and forth<br> behind Ellen. Mammy stood beside the table, watching every<br> forkful that traveled from plate to mouth, as though she intended<br> to force the food down Ellen's throat should she see signs of<br> flagging. Ellen ate diligently, but Scarlett could see that she<br> was too tired to know what she was eating. Only Mammy's implacable<br> face forced her to it.<br><br> When the dish was empty and Gerald only midway in his remarks on<br> the thievishness of Yankees who wanted to free darkies and yet<br> offered no penny to pay for their freedom, Ellen rose.<br><br> ‘We'll be having prayers?’ he questioned, reluctantly.<br><br> ‘Yes. It is so late--why, it is actually ten o'clock,’ as the<br> clock with coughing and tinny thumps marked the hour. ‘Carreen<br> should have been asleep long ago. The lamp, please, Pork, and my<br> prayer book, Mammy.’<br><br> Prompted by Mammy's hoarse whisper, Jack set his fly-brush in the<br> corner and removed the dishes, while Mammy fumbled in the<br> sideboard drawer for Ellen's worn prayer book. Pork, tiptoeing,<br> reached the ring in the chain and drew the lamp slowly down until<br> the table top was brightly bathed in light and the ceiling receded<br> into shadows. Ellen arranged her skirts and sank to the floor on<br> her knees, laying the open prayer book on the table before her and<br> clasping her hands upon it. Gerald knelt beside her, and Scarlett<br> and Suellen took their accustomed places on the opposite side of<br> the table, folding their voluminous petticoats in pads under their<br> knees, so they would ache less from contact with the hard floor.<br> Carreen, who was small for her age, could not kneel comfortably at<br> the table and so knelt facing a chair, her elbows on the seat.<br> She liked this position, for she seldom failed to go to sleep<br> during prayers and, in this postures it escaped her mother's<br> notice.<br><br> The house servants shuffled and rustled in the hall to kneel by<br> the doorway, Mammy groaning aloud as she sank down, Pork straight<br> as a ramrod, Rosa and Teena, the maids, graceful in their<br> spreading bright calicoes, Cookie gaunt and yellow beneath her<br> snowy head rag, and Jack, stupid with sleep, as far away from<br> Mammy's pinching fingers as possible. Their dark eyes gleamed<br> expectantly, for praying with their white folks was one of the<br> events of the day. The old and colorful phrases of the litany<br> with its Oriental imagery meant little to them but it satisfied<br> something in their hearts, and they always swayed when they<br> chanted the responses: ‘Lord, have mercy on us,’ ‘Christ, have<br> mercy on us.’<br><br> Ellen closed her eyes and began praying, her voice rising and<br> falling, lulling and soothing. Heads bowed in the circle of<br> yellow light as Ellen thanked God for the health and happiness of<br> her home, her family and her negroes.<br><br> When she had finished her prayers for those beneath the roof of<br> Tara, her father, mother, sisters, three dead babies and ‘all the<br> poor souls in Purgatory,’ she clasped her white beads between long<br> fingers and began the Rosary. Like the rushing of a soft wind,<br> the responses from black throats and white throats rolled back:<br><br> ‘Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the<br> hour of our death.’<br><br> Despite her heartache and the pain of unshed tears, a deep sense<br> of quiet and peace fell upon Scarlett as it always did at this<br> hour. Some of the disappointment of the day and the dread of the<br> morrow departed from her, leaving a feeling of hope. It was not<br> the lifting up of her heart to God that brought this balm, for<br> religion went no more than lip deep with her. It was the sight of<br> her mother's serene face upturned to the throne of God and His<br> saints and angels, praying for blessings on those whom she loved.<br> When Ellen intervened with Heaven, Scarlett felt certain that<br> Heaven heard.<br><br> Ellen finished and Gerald, who could never find his beads at<br> prayer time, began furtively counting his decade on his fingers.<br> As his voice droned on, Scarlett's thoughts strayed, in spite of<br> herself. She knew she should be examining her conscience. Ellen<br> had taught her that at the end of each day it was her duty to<br> examine her conscience thoroughly, to admit her numerous faults<br> and pray to God for forgiveness and strength never to repeat them.<br> But Scarlett was examining her heart.<br><br> She dropped her head upon her folded hands so that her mother<br> could not see her face, and her thoughts went sadly back to<br> Ashley. How could he be planning to marry Melanie when he really<br> loved her, Scarlett? And when he knew how much she loved him?<br> How could he deliberately break her heart?<br><br> Then, suddenly, an idea, shining and new, flashed like a comet<br> through her brain.<br><br> ‘Why, Ashley hasn't an idea that I'm in love with him!’<br><br> She almost gasped aloud in the shock of its unexpectedness. Her<br> mind stood still as if paralyzed for a long, breathless instant,<br> and then raced forward.<br><br> ‘How could he know? I've always acted so prissy and ladylike and<br> touch-me-not around him he probably thinks I don't care a thing<br> about him except as a friend. Yes, that's why he's never spoken!<br> He thinks his love is hopeless. And that's why he's looked so--’<br><br> Her mind went swiftly back to those times when she had caught him<br> looking at her in that strange manner, when the gray eyes that<br> were such perfect curtains for his thoughts had been wide and<br> naked and had in them a look of torment and despair.<br><br> ‘He's been broken hearted because he thinks I'm in love with Brent<br> or Stuart or Cade. And probably he thinks that if he can't have<br> me, he might as well please his family and marry Melanie. But if<br> he knew I did love him--’<br><br> Her volatile spirits shot up from deepest depression to excited<br> happiness. This was the answer to Ashley's reticence, to his<br> strange conduct. He didn't know! Her vanity leaped to the aid of<br> her desire to believe, making belief a certainty. If he knew she<br> loved him, he would hasten to her side. She had only to--<br><br> ‘Oh!’ she thought rapturously, digging her fingers into her<br> lowered brow. ‘What a fool I've been not to think of this till<br> now! I must think of some way to let him know. He wouldn't marry<br> her if he knew I loved him! How could he?’<br><br> With a start, she realized that Gerald had finished and her<br> mother's eyes were on her. Hastily she began her decade, telling<br> off the beads automatically but with a depth of emotion in her<br> voice that caused Mammy to open her eyes and shoot a searching<br> glance at her. As she finished her prayers and Suellen, then<br> Carreen, began their decades, her mind was still speeding onward<br> with her entrancing new thought.<br><br> Even now, it wasn't too late! Too often the County had been<br> scandalized by elopements when one or the other of the<br> participating parties was practically at the altar with a third.<br> And Ashley's engagement had not even been announced yet! Yes,<br> there was plenty of time!<br><br> If no love lay between Ashley and Melanie but only a promise given<br> long ago, then why wasn't it possible for him to break that<br> promise and marry her? Surely he would do it, if he knew that<br> she, Scarlett, loved him. She must find some way to let him know.<br> She would find some way! And then--<br><br> Scarlett came abruptly out of her dream of delight, for she had<br> neglected to make the responses and her mother was looking at her<br> reprovingly. As she resumed the ritual, she opened her eyes<br> briefly and cast a quick glance around the room. The kneeling<br> figures, the soft glow of the lamp, the dim shadows where the<br> negroes swayed, even the familiar objects that had been so hateful<br> to her sight an hour ago, in an instant took on the color of her<br> own emotions, and the room seemed once more a lovely place. She<br> would never forget this moment or this scene!<br><br> ‘Virgin most faithful,’ her mother intoned. The Litany of the<br> Virgin was beginning, and obediently Scarlett responded: ‘Pray<br> for us,’ as Ellen praised in soft contralto the attributes of the<br> Mother of God.<br><br> As always since childhood, this was, for Scarlett, a moment for<br> adoration of Ellen, rather than the Virgin. Sacrilegious though<br> it might be, Scarlett always saw, through her closed eyes, the<br> upturned face of Ellen and not the Blessed Virgin, as the ancient<br> phrases were repeated. ‘Health of the Sick,’ ‘Seat of Wisdom,’<br> ‘Refuge of Sinners,’ ‘Mystical Rose’--they were beautiful because<br> they were the attributes of Ellen. But tonight, because of the<br> exaltation of her own spirit, Scarlett found in the whole<br> ceremonial, the softly spoken words, the murmur of the responses,<br> a surpassing beauty beyond any that she had ever experienced<br> before. And her heart went up to God in sincere thankfulness that<br> a pathway for her feet had been opened--out of her misery and<br> straight to the arms of Ashley.<br><br> When the last ‘Amen’ sounded, they all rose, somewhat stiffly,<br> Mammy being hauled to her feet by the combined efforts of Teena<br> and Rosa. Pork took a long spiller from the mantelpiece, lit it<br> from the lamp flame and went into the hall. Opposite the winding<br> stair stood a walnut sideboard, too large for use in the dining<br> room, bearing on its wide top several lamps and a long row of<br> candles in candlesticks. Pork lit one lamp and three candles and,<br> with the pompous dignity of a first chamberlain of the royal<br> bedchamber lighting a king and queen to their rooms, he led the<br> procession up the stairs, holding the light high above his head.<br> Ellen, on Gerald's arm, followed him, and the girls, each taking<br> her own candlestick, mounted after them.<br><br> Scarlett entered her room, set the candle on the tall chest of<br> drawers and fumbled in the dark closet for the dancing dress that<br> needed stitching. Throwing it across her arm, she crossed the<br> hall quietly. The door of her parents' bedroom was slightly ajar<br> and, before she could knock, Ellen's voice, low but stern, came to<br> her ears.<br><br> ‘Mr. O'Hara, you must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.’<br><br> Gerald exploded. ‘And where will I be getting another overseer<br> who wouldn't be cheating me out of my eyeteeth?’<br><br> ‘He must be dismissed, immediately, tomorrow morning. Big Sam is<br> a good foreman and he can take over the duties until you can hire<br> another overseer.’<br><br> ‘Ah, ha!’ came Gerald's voice. ‘So, I understand! Then the<br> worthy Jonas sired the--’<br><br> ‘He must be dismissed.’<br><br> ‘So, he is the father of Emmie Slattery's baby,’ thought Scarlett.<br> ‘Oh, well, what else can you expect from a Yankee man and a white-<br> trash girl?’<br><br> Then, after a discreet pause which gave Gerald's splutterings time<br> to die away, she knocked on the door and handed the dress to her<br> mother.<br><br> By the time Scarlett had undressed and blown out the candle, her<br> plan for tomorrow had worked itself out in every detail. It was a<br> simple plan, for, with Gerald's single-mindedness of purpose, her<br> eyes were centered on the goal and she thought only of the most<br> direct steps by which to reach it.<br><br> First, she would be ‘prideful,’ as Gerald had commanded. From the<br> moment she arrived at Twelve Oaks, she would be her gayest, most<br> spirited self. No one would suspect that she had ever been<br> downhearted because of Ashley and Melanie. And she would flirt<br> with every man there. That would be cruel to Ashley, but it would<br> make him yearn for her all the more. She wouldn't overlook a man<br> of marriageable age, from ginger-whiskered old Frank Kennedy, who<br> was Suellen's beau, on down to shy, quiet, blushing Charles<br> Hamilton, Melanie's brother. They would swarm around her like<br> bees around a hive, and certainly Ashley would be drawn from<br> Melanie to join the circle of her admirers. Then somehow she<br> would maneuver to get a few minutes alone with him, away from the<br> crowd. She hoped everything would work out that way, because it<br> would be more difficult otherwise. But if Ashley didn't make the<br> first move, she would simply have to do it herself.<br><br> When they were finally alone, he would have fresh in his mind the<br> picture of the other men thronging about her, he would be newly<br> impressed with the fact that every one of them wanted her, and<br> that look of sadness and despair would be in his eyes. Then she<br> would make him happy again by letting him discover that, popular<br> though she was, she preferred him above any other man in all the<br> world. And when she admitted it, modestly and sweetly, she would<br> look a thousand things more. Of course, she would do it all in a<br> ladylike way. She wouldn't even dream of saying to him boldly<br> that she loved him--that would never do. But the manner of<br> telling him was a detail that troubled her not at all. She had<br> managed such situations before and she could do it again.<br><br> Lying in the bed with the moonlight streaming dimly over her,<br> she pictured the whole scene in her mind. She saw the look of<br> surprise and happiness that would come over his face when he<br> realized that she really loved him, and she heard the words he<br> would say asking her to be his wife.<br><br> Naturally, she would have to say then that she simply couldn't<br> think of marrying a man when he was engaged to another girl, but<br> he would insist and finally she would let herself be persuaded.<br> Then they would decide to run off to Jonesboro that very afternoon<br> and--<br><br> Why, by this time tomorrow night, she might be Mrs. Ashley Wilkes!<br><br> She sat up in bed, hugging her knees, and for a long happy moment<br> she WAS Mrs. Ashley Wilkes--Ashley's bride! Then a slight chill<br> entered her heart. Suppose it didn't work out this way? Suppose<br> Ashley didn't beg her to run away with him? Resolutely she pushed<br> the thought from her mind.<br><br> ‘I won't think of that now,’ she said firmly. ‘If I think of it<br> now, it will upset me. There's no reason why things won't come<br> out the way I want them--if he loves me. And I know he does!’<br><br> She raised her chin and her pale, black-fringed eyes sparkled in<br> the moonlight. Ellen had never told her that desire and<br> attainment were two different matters; life had not taught her<br> that the race was not to the swift. She lay in the silvery<br> shadows with courage rising and made the plans that a sixteen-<br> year-old makes when life has been so pleasant that defeat is an<br> impossibility and a pretty dress and a clear complexion are<br> weapons to vanquish fate.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER V<br><br> <br> It was ten o'clock in the morning. The day was warm for April and<br> the golden sunlight streamed brilliantly into Scarlett's room<br> through the blue curtains of the wide windows. The cream-colored<br> walls glowed with light and the depths of the mahogany furniture<br> gleamed deep red like wine, while the floor glistened as if it<br> were glass, except where the rag rugs covered it and they were<br> spots of gay color.<br><br> Already summer was in the air, the first hint of Georgia summer<br> when the high tide of spring gives way reluctantly before a<br> fiercer heat. A balmy, soft warmth poured into the room, heavy<br> with velvety smells, redolent of many blossoms, of newly fledged<br> trees and of the moist, freshly turned red earth. Through the<br> window Scarlett could see the bright riot of the twin lanes of<br> daffodils bordering the graveled driveway and the golden masses of<br> yellow jessamine spreading flowery sprangles modestly to the earth<br> like crinolines. The mockingbirds and the jays, engaged in their<br> old feud for possession of the magnolia tree beneath her window,<br> were bickering, the jays strident, acrimonious, the mockers sweet<br> voiced and plaintive.<br><br> Such a glowing morning usually called Scarlett to the window, to<br> lean arms on the broad sill and drink in the scents and sounds of<br> Tara. But, today she had no eye for sun or azure sky beyond a<br> hasty thought, ‘Thank God, it isn't raining.’ On the bed lay the<br> apple-green, watered-silk ball dress with its festoons of ecru<br> lace, neatly packed in a large cardboard box. It was ready to be<br> carried to Twelve Oaks to be donned before the dancing began, but<br> Scarlett shrugged at the sight of it. If her plans were<br> successful, she would not wear that dress tonight. Long before<br> the ball began, she and Ashley would be on their way to Jonesboro<br> to be married. The troublesome question was--what dress should<br> she wear to the barbecue?<br><br> What dress would best set off her charms and make her most<br> irresistible to Ashley? Since eight o'clock she had been trying<br> on and rejecting dresses, and now she stood dejected and irritable<br> in lace pantalets, linen corset cover and three billowing lace and<br> linen petticoats. Discarded garments lay about her on the floor,<br> the bed, the chairs, in bright heaps of color and straying<br> ribbons.<br><br> The rose organdie with long pink sash was becoming, but she had<br> worn it last summer when Melanie visited Twelve Oaks and she'd be<br> sure to remember it. And might be catty enough to mention it.<br> The black bombazine, with its puffed sleeves and princess lace<br> collar, set off her white skin superbly, but it did make her look<br> a trifle elderly. Scarlett peered anxiously in the mirror at her<br> sixteen-year-old face as if expecting to see wrinkles and sagging<br> chin muscles. It would never do to appear sedate and elderly<br> before Melanie's sweet youthfulness. The lavender barred muslin<br> was beautiful with those wide insets of lace and net about the<br> hem, but it had never suited her type. It would suit Carreen's<br> delicate profile and wishy-washy expression perfectly, but<br> Scarlett felt that it made her look like a schoolgirl. It would<br> never do to appear schoolgirlish beside Melanie's poised self.<br> The green plaid taffeta, frothing with flounces and each flounce<br> edged in green velvet ribbon, was most becoming, in fact her<br> favorite dress, for it darkened her eyes to emerald. But there<br> was unmistakably a grease spot on the front of the basque. Of<br> course, her brooch could be pinned over the spot, but perhaps<br> Melanie had sharp eyes. There remained varicolored cotton dresses<br> which Scarlett felt were not festive enough for the occasion, ball<br> dresses and the green sprigged muslin she had worn yesterday. But<br> it was an afternoon dress. It was not suitable for a barbecue,<br> for it had only tiny puffed sleeves and the neck was low enough<br> for a dancing dress. But there was nothing else to do but wear<br> it. After all she was not ashamed of her neck and arms and bosom,<br> even if it was not correct to show them in the morning.<br><br> As she stood before the mirror and twisted herself about to get a<br> side view, she thought that there was absolutely nothing about her<br> figure to cause her shame. Her neck was short but rounded and her<br> arms plump and enticing. Her breasts, pushed high by her stays,<br> were very nice breasts. She had never had to sew tiny rows of<br> silk ruffles in the lining of her basques, as most sixteen-year-<br> old girls did, to give their figures the desired curves and<br> fullness. She was glad she had inherited Ellen's slender white<br> hands and tiny feet, and she wished she had Ellen's height, too,<br> but her own height pleased her very well. What a pity legs could<br> not be shown, she thought, pulling up her petticoats and<br> regretfully viewing them, plump and neat under pantalets. She had<br> such nice legs. Even the girls at the Fayetteville Academy had<br> admitted as much. And as for her waist--there was no one in<br> Fayetteville, Jonesboro or in three counties, for that matter, who<br> had so small a waist.<br><br> The thought of her waist brought her back to practical matters.<br> The green muslin measured seventeen inches about the waist, and<br> Mammy had laced her for the eighteen-inch bombazine. Mammy would<br> have to lace her tighter. She pushed open the door, listened and<br> heard Mammy's heavy tread in the downstairs hall. She shouted for<br> her impatiently, knowing she could raise her voice with impunity,<br> as Ellen was in the smokehouse, measuring out the day's food to<br> Cookie.<br><br> ‘Some folks thinks as how Ah kin fly,’ grumbled Mammy, shuffling<br> up the stairs. She entered puffing, with the expression of one<br> who expects battle and welcomes it. In her large black hands was<br> a tray upon which food smoked, two large yams covered with butter,<br> a pile of buckwheat cakes dripping syrup, and a large slice of ham<br> swimming in gravy. Catching sight of Mammy's burden, Scarlett's<br> expression changed from one of minor irritation to obstinate<br> belligerency. In the excitement of trying on dresses she had<br> forgotten Mammy's ironclad rule that, before going to any party,<br> the O'Hara girls must be crammed so full of food at home they<br> would be unable to eat any refreshments at the party.<br><br> ‘It's no use. I won't eat it. You can just take it back to the<br> kitchen.’<br><br> Mammy set the tray on the table and squared herself, hands on<br> hips.<br><br> ‘Yas'm, you is! Ah ain' figgerin' on havin' happen whut happen at<br> dat las' barbecue w'en Ah wuz too sick frum dem chittlins Ah et<br> ter fetch you no tray befo' you went. You is gwine eat eve'y bite<br> of dis.’<br><br> ‘I am not! Now, come here and lace me tighter because we are late<br> already. I heard the carriage come round to the front of the<br> house.’<br><br> Mammy's tone became wheedling.<br><br> ‘Now, Miss Scarlett, you be good an' come eat jes'a lil. Miss<br> Carreen an' Miss Suellen done eat all dey'n.’<br><br> ‘They would,’ said Scarlett contemptuously. ‘They haven't any<br> more spirit than a rabbit. But I won't! I'm through with trays.<br> I'm not forgetting the time I ate a whole tray and went to the<br> Calverts' and they had ice cream out of ice they'd brought all the<br> way from Savannah, and I couldn't eat but a spoonful. I'm going<br> to have a good time today and eat as much as I please.’<br><br> At this defiant heresy, Mammy's brow lowered with indignation.<br> What a young miss could do and what she could not do were as<br> different as black and white in Mammy's mind; there was no middle<br> ground of deportment between. Suellen and Carreen were clay in<br> her powerful hands and harkened respectfully to her warning. But<br> it had always been a struggle to teach Scarlett that most of her<br> natural impulses were unladylike. Mammy's victories over Scarlett<br> were hard-won and represented guile unknown to the white mind.<br><br> ‘Ef you doan care 'bout how folks talks 'bout dis fainbly, Ah<br> does,’ she rumbled. ‘Ah ain' gwine stand by an' have eve'ybody at<br> de pahty sayin' how you ain' fotched up right. Ah has tole you<br> an' tole you dat you kin allus tell a lady by dat she eat lak a<br> bird. An' Ah ain' aimin' ter have you go ter Mist' Wilkes' an'<br> eat lak a fe'el han' an' gobble lak a hawg.’<br><br> ‘Mother is a lady and she eats,’ countered Scarlett.<br><br> ‘W'en you is mahied, you kin eat, too,’ retorted Mammy. ‘W'en<br> Miss Ellen yo' age, she never et nuthin' w'en she went out, an'<br> needer yo' Aunt Pauline nor yo' Aunt Eulalie. An' dey all done<br> mahied. Young misses whut eats heavy mos' gener'ly doan never<br> ketch husbands.’<br><br> ‘I don't believe it. At that barbecue when you were sick and I<br> didn't eat beforehand, Ashley Wilkes told me he LIKED to see a<br> girl with a healthy appetite.’<br><br> Mammy shook her head ominously.<br><br> ‘Whut gempmums says an' whut dey thinks is two diffunt things.<br> An' Ah ain' noticed Mist' Ashley axing fer ter mahy you.’<br><br> Scarlett scowled, started to speak sharply and then caught<br> herself. Mammy had her there and there was no argument. Seeing<br> the obdurate look on Scarlett's face, Mammy picked up the tray<br> and, with the bland guile of her race, changed her tactics. As<br> she started for the door, she sighed.<br><br> ‘Well'm, awright. Ah wuz tellin' Cookie w'ile she wuz a-fixin'<br> dis tray. 'You kin sho tell a lady by whut she DOAN eat,' an' Ah<br> say ter Cookie. 'Ah ain' seed no w'ite lady who et less'n Miss<br> Melly Hamilton did las' time she wuz visitin' Mist' Ashley'--Ah<br> means, visitin' Miss India.’<br><br> Scarlett shot a look of sharp suspicion at her, but Mammy's broad<br> face carried only a look of innocence and of regret that Scarlett<br> was not the lady Melanie Hamilton was.<br><br> ‘Put down that tray and come lace me tighter,’ said Scarlett<br> irritably. ‘And I'll try to eat a little afterwards. If I ate<br> now I couldn't lace tight enough.’<br><br> Cloaking her triumph, Mammy set down the tray.<br><br> ‘Whut mah lamb gwine wear?’<br><br> ‘That,’ answered Scarlett, pointing at the fluffy mass of green<br> flowered muslin. Instantly Mammy was in arms.<br><br> ‘No, you ain'. It ain' fittin' fer mawnin'. You kain show yo'<br> buzzum befo' three o'clock an' dat dress ain' got no neck an' no<br> sleeves. An' you'll git freckled sho as you born, an' Ah ain'<br> figgerin' on you gittin' freckled affer all de buttermilk Ah been<br> puttin' on you all dis winter, bleachin' dem freckles you got at<br> Savannah settin' on de beach. Ah sho gwine speak ter yo' Ma 'bout<br> you.’<br><br> ‘If you say one word to her before I'm dressed I won't eat a<br> bite,’ said Scarlett coolly. ‘Mother won't have time to send me<br> back to change once I'm dressed.’<br><br> Mammy sighed resignedly, beholding herself outguessed. Between<br> the two evils, it was better to have Scarlett wear an afternoon<br> dress at a morning barbecue than to have her gobble like a hog.<br><br> ‘Hole onter sumpin' an' suck in yo' breaf,’ she commanded.<br><br> Scarlett obeyed, bracing herself and catching firm hold of one of<br> the bedposts. Mammy pulled and jerked vigorously and, as the tiny<br> circumference of whalebone-girdled waist grew smaller, a proud,<br> fond look came into her eyes.<br><br> ‘Ain' nobody got a wais' lak mah lamb,’ she said approvingly.<br> ‘Eve'y time Ah pulls Miss Suellen littler dan twenty inches, she<br> up an' faint.’<br><br> ‘Pooh!’ gasped Scarlctt, speaking with difficulty. ‘I never<br> fainted in my life.’<br><br> ‘Well, 'twouldn' do no hahm ef you wuz ter faint now an' den,’<br> advised Mammy. ‘You is so brash sometimes, Miss Scarlett. Ah<br> been aimin' ter tell you, it jes' doan look good de way you doan<br> faint 'bout snakes an' mouses an' sech. Ah doan mean round home<br> but w'en you is out in comp'ny. An' Ah has tole you an'--’<br><br> ‘Oh, hurry! Don't talk so much. I'll catch a husband. See if I<br> don't, even if I don't scream and faint. Goodness, but my stays<br> are tight! Put on the dress.’<br><br> Mammy carefully dropped the twelve yards of green sprigged muslin<br> over the mountainous petticoats and hooked up the back of the<br> tight, low-cut basque.<br><br> ‘You keep yo' shawl on yo' shoulders w'en you is in de sun, an'<br> doan you go takin' off yo' hat w'en you is wahm,’ she commanded.<br> ‘Elsewise you be comin' home lookin' brown lak Ole Miz Slattery.<br> Now, you come eat, honey, but doan eat too fas'. No use havin' it<br> come right back up agin.’<br><br> Scarlett obediently sat down before the tray, wondering if she<br> would be able to get any food into her stomach and still have room<br> to breathe. Mammy plucked a large towel from the washstand and<br> carefully tied it around Scarlett's neck, spreading the white<br> folds over her lap. Scarlett began on the ham, because she liked<br> ham, and forced it down.<br><br> ‘I wish to Heaven I was married,’ she said resentfully as she<br> attacked the yams with loathing. ‘I'm tired of everlastingly<br> being unnatural and never doing anything I want to do. I'm tired<br> of acting like I don't eat more than a bird, and walking when I<br> want to run and saying I feel faint after a waltz, when I could<br> dance for two days and never get tired. I'm tired of saying, 'How<br> wonderful you are!' to fool men who haven't got one-half the sense<br> I've got, and I'm tired of pretending I don't know anything, so<br> men can tell me things and feel important while they're doing<br> it. . . . I can't eat another bite.’<br><br> ‘Try a hot cake,’ said Mammy inexorably.<br><br> ‘Why is it a girl has to be so silly to catch a husband?’<br><br> ‘Ah specs it's kase gempmums doan know whut dey wants. Dey jes'<br> knows whut dey thinks dey wants. An' givin' dem whut dey thinks<br> dey wants saves a pile of mizry an' bein' a ole maid. An' dey<br> thinks dey wants mousy lil gals wid bird's tastes an' no sense at<br> all. It doan make a gempmum feel lak mahyin' a lady ef he<br> suspicions she got mo' sense dan he has.’<br><br> ‘Don't you suppose men get surprised after they're married to find<br> that their wives do have sense?’<br><br> ‘Well, it's too late den. Dey's already mahied. 'Sides, gempmums<br> specs dey wives ter have sense.’<br><br> ‘Some day I'm going to do and say everything I want to do and say,<br> and if people don't like it I don't care.’<br><br> ‘No, you ain',’ said Mammy grimly. ‘Not while Ah got breaf. You<br> eat dem cakes. Sop dem in de gravy, honey.’<br><br> ‘I don't think Yankee girls have to act like such fools. When we<br> were at Saratoga last year, I noticed plenty of them acting like<br> they had right good sense and in front of men, too.’<br><br> Mammy snorted.<br><br> ‘Yankee gals! Yas'm, Ah guess dey speaks dey minds awright, but<br> Ah ain' noticed many of dem gittin' proposed ter at Saratoga.’<br><br> ‘But Yankees must get married,’ argued Scarlett. ‘They don't just<br> grow. They must get married and have children. There's too many<br> of them.’<br><br> ‘Men mahys dem fer dey money,’ said Mammy firmly.<br><br> Scarlett sopped the wheat cake in the gravy and put it in her<br> mouth. Perhaps there was something to what Mammy said. There<br> must be something in it, for Ellen said the same things, in<br> different and more delicate words. In fact, the mothers of all<br> her girl friends impressed on their daughters the necessity of<br> being helpless, clinging, doe-eyed creatures. Really, it took a<br> lot of sense to cultivate and hold such a pose. Perhaps she had<br> been too brash. Occasionally she had argued with Ashley and<br> frankly aired her opinions. Perhaps this and her healthy<br> enjoyment of walking and riding had turned him from her to the<br> frail Melanie. Perhaps if she changed her tactics-- But she felt<br> that if Ashley succumbed to premeditated feminine tricks, she<br> could never respect him as she now did. Any man who was fool<br> enough to fall for a simper, a faint and an ‘Oh, how wonderful you<br> are!’ wasn't worth having. But they all seemed to like it.<br><br> If she had used the wrong tactics with Ashley in the past--well,<br> that was the past and done with. Today she would use different<br> ones, the right ones. She wanted him and she had only a few hours<br> in which to get him. If fainting, or pretending to faint, would<br> do the trick, then she would faint. If simpering, coquetry or<br> empty-headedness would attract him, she would gladly play the<br> flirt and be more empty-headed than even Cathleen Calvert. And if<br> bolder measures were necessary, she would take them. Today was<br> the day!<br><br> There was no one to tell Scarlett that her own personality,<br> frighteningly vital though it was, was more attractive than any<br> masquerade she might adopt. Had she been told, she would have<br> been pleased but unbelieving. And the civilization of which she<br> was a part would have been unbelieving too, for at no time, before<br> or since, had so low a premium been placed on feminine<br> naturalness.<br><br> <br><br> As the carriage bore her down the red road toward the Wilkes<br> plantation, Scarlett had a feeling of guilty pleasure that neither<br> her mother nor Mammy was with the party. There would be no one at<br> the barbecue who, by delicately lifted brows or out-thrust<br> underlip, could interfere with her plan of action. Of course,<br> Suellen would be certain to tell tales tomorrow, but if all went<br> as Scarlett hoped, the excitement of the family over her<br> engagement to Ashley or her elopement would more than overbalance<br> their displeasure. Yes, she was very glad Ellen had been forced<br> to stay at home.<br><br> Gerald, primed with brandy, had given Jonas Wilkerson his<br> dismissal that morning, and Ellen had remained at Tara to go over<br> the accounts of the plantation before he took his departure.<br> Scarlett had kissed her mother good-by in the little office where<br> she sat before the tall secretary with its paper-stuffed<br> pigeonholes. Jonas Wilkerson, hat in hand, stood beside her, his<br> sallow tight-skinned face hardly concealing the fury of hate that<br> possessed him at being so unceremoniously turned out of the best<br> overseer's job in the County. And all because of a bit of minor<br> philandering. He had told Gerald over and over that Emmie<br> Slattery's baby might have been fathered by any one of a dozen men<br> as easily as himself--an idea in which Gerald concurred--but that<br> had not altered his case so far as Ellen was concerned. Jonas<br> hated all Southerners. He hated their cool courtesy to him and<br> their contempt for his social status, so inadequately covered by<br> their courtesy. He hated Ellen O'Hara above anyone else, for she<br> was the epitome of all that he hated in Southerners.<br><br> Mammy, as head woman of the plantation, had remained to help<br> Ellen, and it was Dilcey who rode on the driver's seat beside<br> Toby, the girls' dancing dresses in a long box across her lap.<br> Gerald rode beside the carriage on his big hunter, warm with<br> brandy and pleased with himself for having gotten through with the<br> unpleasant business of Wilkerson so speedily. He had shoved the<br> responsibility onto Ellen, and her disappointment at missing the<br> barbecue and the gathering of her friends did not enter his mind;<br> for it was a fine spring day and his fields were beautiful and the<br> birds were singing and he felt too young and frolicsome to think<br> of anyone else. Occasionally he burst out with ‘Peg in a Low-<br> backed Car’ and other Irish ditties or the more lugubrious lament<br> for Robert Emmet, ‘She is far from the land where her young hero<br> sleeps.’<br><br> He was happy, pleasantly excited over the prospect of spending the<br> day shouting about the Yankees and the war, and proud of his three<br> pretty daughters in their bright spreading hoop skirts beneath<br> foolish little lace parasols. He gave no thought to his<br> conversation of the day before with Scarlett, for it had<br> completely slipped his mind. He only thought that she was pretty<br> and a great credit to him and that, today, her eyes were as green<br> as the hills of Ireland. The last thought made him think better<br> of himself, for it had a certain poetic ring to it, and so he<br> favored the girls with a loud and slightly off-key rendition of<br> ‘The Wearin' o' the Green.’<br><br> Scarlett, looking at him with the affectionate contempt that<br> mothers feel for small swaggering sons, knew that he would be very<br> drunk by sundown. Coming home in the dark, he would try, as<br> usual, to jump every fence between Twelve Oaks and Tara and, she<br> hoped, by the mercy of Providence and the good sense of his horse,<br> would escape breaking his neck. He would disdain the bridge and<br> swim his horse through the river and come home roaring, to be put<br> to bed on the sofa in the office by Pork who always waited up with<br> a lamp in the front hall on such occasions.<br><br> He would ruin his new gray broadcloth suit, which would cause him<br> to swear horribly in the morning and tell Ellen at great length<br> how his horse fell off the bridge in the darkness--a palpable lie<br> which would fool no one but which would be accepted by all and<br> make him feel very clever.<br><br> Pa is a sweet, selfish, irresponsible darling, Scarlett thought,<br> with a surge of affection for him. She felt so excited and happy<br> this morning that she included the whole world, as well as Gerald,<br> in her affection. She was pretty and she knew it; she would have<br> Ashley for her own before the day was over; the sun was warm and<br> tender and the glory of the Georgia spring was spread before her<br> eyes. Along the roadside the blackberry brambles were concealing<br> with softest green the savage red gulches cut by the winter's<br> rains, and the bare granite boulders pushing up through the red<br> earth were being draped with sprangles of Cherokee roses and<br> compassed about by wild violets of palest purple hue. Upon the<br> wooded hills above the river, the dogwood blossoms lay glistening<br> and white, as if snow still lingered among the greenery. The<br> flowering crab trees were bursting their buds and rioting from<br> delicate white to deepest pink and, beneath the trees where the<br> sunshine dappled the pine straw, the wild honeysuckle made a<br> varicolored carpet of scarlet and orange and rose. There was a<br> faint wild fragrance of sweet shrub on the breeze and the world<br> smelled good enough to eat.<br><br> ‘I'll remember how beautiful this day is till I die,’ thought<br> Scarlett. ‘Perhaps it will be my wedding day!’<br><br> And she thought with a tingling in her heart how she and Ashley<br> might ride swiftly through this beauty of blossom and greenery<br> this very afternoon, or tonight by moonlight, toward Jonesboro and<br> a preacher. Of course, she would have to be remarried by a priest<br> from Atlanta, but that would be something for Ellen and Gerald to<br> worry about. She quailed a little as she thought how white with<br> mortification Ellen would be at hearing that her daughter had<br> eloped with another girl's fiance, but she knew Ellen would<br> forgive her when she saw her happiness. And Gerald would scold<br> and bawl but, for all his remarks of yesterday about not wanting<br> her to marry Ashley, he would be pleased beyond words at an<br> alliance between his family and the Wilkes.<br><br> ‘But that'll be something to worry about after I'm married,’ she<br> thought, tossing the worry from her.<br><br> It was impossible to feel anything but palpitating joy in this<br> warm sun, in this spring, with the chimneys of Twelve Oaks just<br> beginning to show on the hill across the river.<br><br> ‘I'll live there all my life and I'll see fifty springs like this<br> and maybe more, and I'll tell my children and my grandchildren how<br> beautiful this spring was, lovelier than any they'll ever see.’<br> She was so happy at this thought that she joined in the last<br> chorus of ‘The Wearin' o' the Green’ and won Gerald's shouted<br> approval.<br><br> ‘I don't know why you're so happy this morning,’ said Suellen<br> crossly, for the thought still rankled in her mind that she would<br> look far better in Scarlett's green silk dancing frock than its<br> rightful owner would. And why was Scarlett always so selfish<br> about lending her clothes and bonnets? And why did Mother always<br> back her up, declaring green was not Suellen's color? ‘You know<br> as well as I do that Ashley's engagement is going to be announced<br> tonight. Pa said so this morning. And I know you've been sweet<br> on him for months.’<br><br> ‘That's all you know,’ said Scarlett, putting out her tongue and<br> refusing to lose her good humor. How surprised Miss Sue would be<br> by this time tomorrow morning!<br><br> ‘Susie, you know that's not so,’ protested Carreen, shocked.<br> ‘It's Brent that Scarlett cares about.’<br><br> Scarlett turned smiling green eyes upon her younger sister,<br> wondering how anyone could be so sweet. The whole family knew<br> that Carreen's thirteen-year-old heart was set upon Brent<br> Tarleton, who never gave her a thought except as Scarlett's baby<br> sister. When Ellen was not present, the O'Haras teased her to<br> tears about him.<br><br> ‘Darling, I don't care a thing about Brent,’ declared Scarlett,<br> happy enough to be generous. ‘And he doesn't care a thing about<br> me. Why, he's waiting for you to grow up!’<br><br> Carreen's round little face became pink, as pleasure struggled<br> with incredulity.<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett, really?’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, you know Mother said Carreen was too young to think<br> about beaux yet, and there you go putting ideas in her head.’<br><br> ‘Well, go and tattle and see if I care,’ replied Scarlett. ‘You<br> want to hold Sissy back, because you know she's going to be<br> prettier than you in a year or so.’<br><br> ‘You'll be keeping civil tongues in your heads this day, or I'll<br> be taking me crop to you,’ warned Gerald. ‘Now whist! Is it<br> wheels I'm hearing? That'll be the Tarletons or the Fontaines.’<br><br> As they neared the intersecting road that came down the thickly<br> wooded hill from Mimosa and Fairhill, the sound of hooves and<br> carriage wheels became plainer and clamorous feminine voices<br> raised in pleasant dispute sounded from behind the screen of<br> trees. Gerald, riding ahead, pulled up his horse and signed to<br> Toby to stop the carriage where the two roads met.<br><br> ‘'Tis the Tarleton ladies,’ he announced to his daughters, his<br> florid face abeam, for excepting Ellen there was no lady in the<br> County he liked more than the red-haired Mrs. Tarleton. ‘And 'tis<br> herself at the reins. Ah, there's a woman with fine hands for a<br> horse! Feather light and strong as rawhide, and pretty enough to<br> kiss for all that. More's the pity none of you have such hands,’<br> he added, casting fond but reproving glances at his girls. ‘With<br> Carreen afraid of the poor beasts and Sue with hands like sadirons<br> when it comes to reins and you, Puss--’<br><br> ‘Well, at any rate I've never been thrown,’ cried Scarlett<br> indignantly. ‘And Mrs. Tarleton takes a toss at every hunt.’<br><br> ‘And breaks a collar bone like a man,’ said Gerald. ‘No fainting,<br> no fussing. Now, no more of it, for here she comes.’<br><br> He stood up in his stirrups and took off his hat with a sweep, as<br> the Tarleton carriage, overflowing with girls in bright dresses<br> and parasols and fluttering veils, came into view, with Mrs.<br> Tarleton on the box as Gerald had said. With her four daughters,<br> their mammy and their ball dresses in long cardboard boxes<br> crowding the carriage, there was no room for the coachman. And,<br> besides, Beatrice Tarleton never willingly permitted anyone, black<br> or white, to hold reins when her arms were out of slings. Frail,<br> fine-boned, so white of skin that her flaming hair seemed to have<br> drawn all the color from her face into its vital burnished mass,<br> she was nevertheless possessed of exuberant health and untiring<br> energy. She had borne eight children, as red of hair and as full<br> of life as she, and had raised them most successfully, so the<br> County said, because she gave them all the loving neglect and the<br> stern discipline she gave the colts she bred. ‘Curb them but<br> don't break their spirits,’ was Mrs. Tarleton's motto.<br><br> She loved horses and talked horses constantly. She understood<br> them and handled them better than any man in the County. Colts<br> overflowed the paddock onto the front lawn, even as her eight<br> children overflowed the rambling house on the hill, and colts and<br> sons and daughters and hunting dogs tagged after her as she went<br> about the plantation. She credited her horses, especially her red<br> mare, Nellie, with human intelligence; and if the cares of the<br> house kept her busy beyond the time when she expected to take her<br> daily ride, she put the sugar bowl in the hands of some small<br> pickaninny and said: ‘Give Nellie a handful and tell her I'll be<br> out terrectly.’<br><br> Except on rare occasions she always wore her riding habit, for<br> whether she rode or not she always expected to ride and in that<br> expectation put on her habit upon arising. Each morning, rain or<br> shine, Nellie was saddled and walked up and down in front of the<br> house, waiting for the time when Mrs. Tarleton could spare an hour<br> away from her duties. But Fairhill was a difficult plantation to<br> manage and spare time hard to get, and more often than not Nellie<br> walked up and down riderless hour after hour, while Beatrice<br> Tarleton went through the day with the skirt of her habit absently<br> looped over her arm and six inches of shining boot showing below<br> it.<br><br> Today, dressed in dull black silk over unfashionably narrow hoops,<br> she still looked as though in her habit, for the dress was as<br> severely tailored as her riding costume and the small black hat<br> with its long black plume perched over one warm, twinkling, brown<br> eye was a replica of the battered old hat she used for hunting.<br><br> She waved her whip when she saw Gerald and drew her dancing pair<br> of red horses to a halt, and the four girls in the back of the<br> carriage leaned out and gave such vociferous cries of greeting<br> that the team pranced in alarm. To a casual observer it would<br> seem that years had passed since the Tarletons had seen the<br> O'Haras, instead of only two days. But they were a sociable<br> family and liked their neighbors, especially the O'Hara girls.<br> That is, they liked Suellen and Carreen. No girl in the County,<br> with the possible exception of the empty-headed Cathleen Calvert,<br> really liked Scarlett.<br><br> In summers, the County averaged a barbecue and ball nearly every<br> week, but to the red-haired Tarletons with their enormous capacity<br> for enjoying themselves, each barbecue and each ball was as<br> exciting as if it were the first they had ever attended. They<br> were a pretty, buxom quartette, so crammed into the carriage that<br> their hoops and flounces overlapped and their parasols nudged and<br> bumped together above their wide leghorn sun hats, crowned with<br> roses and dangling with black velvet chin ribbons. All shades of<br> red hair were represented beneath these hats, Hetty's plain red<br> hair, Camilla's strawberry blonde, Randa's coppery auburn and<br> small Betsy's carrot top.<br><br> ‘That's a fine bevy, Ma'm,’ said Gerald gallantly, reining his<br> horse alongside the carriage. ‘But it's far they'll go to beat<br> their mother.’<br><br> Mrs. Tarleton rolled her red-brown eyes and sucked in her lower<br> lip in burlesqued appreciation, and the girls cried, ‘Ma, stop<br> making eyes or we'll tell Pa!’ ‘I vow, Mr. O'Hara, she never<br> gives us a chance when there's a handsome man like you around!’<br><br> Scarlett laughed with the rest at these sallies but, as always,<br> the freedom with which the Tarletons treated their mother came as<br> a shock. They acted as if she were one of themselves and not a<br> day over sixteen. To Scarlett, the very idea of saying such<br> things to her own mother was almost sacrilegious. And yet--and<br> yet--there was something very pleasant about the Tarleton girls'<br> relations with their mother, and they adored her for all that they<br> criticized and scolded and teased her. Not, Scarlett loyally<br> hastened to tell herself, that she would prefer a mother like Mrs.<br> Tarleton to Ellen, but still it would be fun to romp with a<br> mother. She knew that even that thought was disrespectful to<br> Ellen and felt ashamed of it. She knew no such troublesome<br> thoughts ever disturbed the brains under the four flaming thatches<br> in the carriage and, as always when she felt herself different<br> from her neighbors, an irritated confusion fell upon her.<br><br> Quick though her brain was, it was not made for analysis, but she<br> half-consciously realized that, for all the Tarleton girls were as<br> unruly as colts and wild as March hares, there was an unworried<br> single-mindedness about them that was part of their inheritance.<br> On both their mother's and their father's side they were<br> Georgians, north Georgians, only a generation away from pioneers.<br> They were sure of themselves and of their environment. They knew<br> instinctively what they were about, as did the Wilkeses, though in<br> widely divergent ways, and in them there was no such conflict as<br> frequently raged in Scarlett's bosom where the blood of a soft-<br> voiced, overbred Coast aristocrat mingled with the shrewd, earthy<br> blood of an Irish peasant. Scarlett wanted to respect and adore<br> her mother like an idol and to rumple her hair and tease her too.<br> And she knew she should be altogether one way or the other. It<br> was the same conflicting emotion that made her desire to appear a<br> delicate and high-bred lady with boys and to be, as well, a hoyden<br> who was not above a few kisses.<br><br> ‘Where's Ellen this morning?’ asked Mrs. Tarleton.<br><br> ‘She's after discharging our overseer and stayed home to go over<br> the accounts with him. Where's himself and the lads?’<br><br> ‘Oh, they rode over to Twelve Oaks hours ago--to sample the punch<br> and see if it was strong enough, I dare say, as if they wouldn't<br> have from now till tomorrow morning to do it! I'm going to ask<br> John Wilkes to keep them overnight, even if he has to bed them<br> down in the stable. Five men in their cups are just too much for<br> me. Up to three, I do very well but--’<br><br> Gerald hastily interrupted to change the subject. He could feel<br> his own daughters snickering behind his back as they remembered in<br> what condition he had come home from the Wilkeses' last barbecue<br> the autumn before.<br><br> ‘And why aren't you riding today, Mrs. Tarleton? Sure, you don't<br> look yourself at all without Nellie. It's a stentor, you are.’<br><br> ‘A stentor, me ignorant broth of a boy!’ cried Mrs. Tarleton,<br> aping his brogue. ‘You mean a centaur. Stentor was a man with a<br> voice like a brass gong.’<br><br> ‘Stentor or centaur, 'tis no matter,’ answered Gerald, unruffled<br> by his error. ‘And 'tis a voice like brass you have, Ma'm, when<br> you're urging on the hounds, so it is.’<br><br> ‘That's one on you, Ma,’ said Betty. ‘I told you you yelled like<br> a Comanche whenever you saw a fox.’<br><br> ‘But not as loud as you yell when Mammy washes your ears,’<br> returned Mrs. Tarleton. ‘And you sixteen! Well, as to why I'm<br> not riding today, Nellie foaled early this morning.’<br><br> ‘Did she now!’ cried Gerald with real interest, his Irishman's<br> passion for horses shining in his eyes, and Scarlett again felt<br> the sense of shock in comparing her mother with Mrs. Tarleton. To<br> Ellen, mares never foaled nor cows calved. In fact, hens almost<br> didn't lay eggs. Ellen ignored these matters completely. But<br> Mrs. Tarleton had no such reticences.<br><br> ‘A little filly, was it?’<br><br> ‘No, a fine little stallion with legs two yards long. You must<br> ride over and see him, Mr. O'Hara. He's a real Tarleton horse.<br> He's as red as Hetty's curls.’<br><br> ‘And looks a lot like Betty, too,’ said Camilla, and then<br> disappeared shrieking amid a welter of skirts and pantalets and<br> bobbing hats, as Betty, who did have a long face, began pinching<br> her.<br><br> ‘My fillies are feeling their oats this morning,’ said Mrs.<br> Tarleton. ‘They've been kicking up their heels ever since we<br> heard the news this morning about Ashley and that little cousin of<br> his from Atlanta. What's her name? Melanie? Bless the child,<br> she's a sweet little thing, but I can never remember either her<br> name or her face. Our cook is the broad wife of the Wilkes<br> butler, and he was over last night with the news that the<br> engagement would be announced tonight and Cookie told us this<br> morning. The girls are all excited about it, though I can't see<br> why. Everybody's known for years that Ashley would marry her,<br> that is, if he didn't marry one of his Burr cousins from Macon.<br> Just like Honey Wilkes is going to marry Melanie's brother,<br> Charles. Now, tell me, Mr. O'Hara, is it illegal for the Wilkes<br> to marry outside of their family? Because if--’<br><br> Scarlett did not hear the rest of the laughing words. For one<br> short instant, it was as though the sun had ducked behind a cool<br> cloud, leaving the world in shadow, taking the color out of<br> things. The freshly green foliage looked sickly, the dogwood<br> pallid, and the flowering crab, so beautifully pink a moment ago,<br> faded and dreary. Scarlett dug her fingers into the upholstery of<br> the carriage and for a moment her parasol wavered. It was one<br> thing to know that Ashley was engaged but it was another to hear<br> people talk about it so casually. Then her courage flowed<br> strongly back and the sun came out again and the landscape glowed<br> anew. She knew Ashley loved her. That was certain. And she<br> smiled as she thought how surprised Mrs. Tarleton would be when no<br> engagement was announced that night--how surprised if there were<br> an elopement. And she'd tell neighbors what a sly boots Scarlett<br> was to sit there and listen to her talk about Melanie when all the<br> time she and Ashley-- She dimpled at her own thoughts and Betty,<br> who had been watching sharply the effect of her mother's words,<br> sank back with a small puzzled frown.<br><br> ‘I don't care what you say, Mr. O'Hara,’ Mrs. Tarleton was saying<br> emphatically. ‘It's all wrong, this marrying of cousins. It's<br> bad enough for Ashley to be marrying the Hamilton child, but for<br> Honey to be marrying that pale-looking Charles Hamilton--’<br><br> ‘Honey'll never catch anybody else if she doesn't marry Charlie,’<br> said Randa, cruel and secure in her own popularity. ‘She's never<br> had another beau except him. And he's never acted very sweet on<br> her, for all that they're engaged. Scarlett, you remember how he<br> ran after you last Christmas--’<br><br> ‘Don't be a cat, Miss,’ said her mother. ‘Cousins shouldn't<br> marry, even second cousins. It weakens the strain. It isn't like<br> horses. You can breed a mare to a brother or a sire to a daughter<br> and get good results if you know your blood strains, but in people<br> it just doesn't work. You get good lines, perhaps, but no<br> stamina. You--’<br><br> ‘Now, Ma'm, I'm taking issue with you on that! Can you name me<br> better people than the Wilkes? And they've been intermarrying<br> since Brian Boru was a boy.’<br><br> ‘And high time they stopped it, for it's beginning to show. Oh,<br> not Ashley so much, for he's a good-looking devil, though even he--<br> But look at those two washed-out-looking Wilkes girls, poor<br> things! Nice girls, of course, but washed out. And look at<br> little Miss Melanie. Thin as a rail and delicate enough for the<br> wind to blow away and no spirit at all. Not a notion of her own.<br> 'No, Ma'm!' 'Yes, Ma'm!' That's all she has to say. You see what<br> I mean? That family needs new blood, fine vigorous blood like my<br> red heads or your Scarlett. Now, don't misunderstand me. The<br> Wilkes are fine folks in their way, and you know I'm fond of them<br> all, but be frank! They are overbred and inbred too, aren't they?<br> They'll do fine on a dry track, a fast track, but mark my words, I<br> don't believe the Wilkes can run on a mud track. I believe the<br> stamina has been bred out of them, and when the emergency arises I<br> don't believe they can run against odds. Dry-weather stock. Give<br> me a big horse who can run in any weather! And their intermarrying<br> has made them different from other folks around here. Always<br> fiddling with the piano or sticking their heads in a book. I do<br> believe Ashley would rather read than hunt! Yes, I honestly believe<br> that, Mr. O'Hara! And just look at the bones on them. Too slender.<br> They need dams and sires with strength--’<br><br> ‘Ah-ah-hum,’ said Gerald, suddenly and guiltily aware that the<br> conversation, a most interesting and entirely proper one to him,<br> would seem quite otherwise to Ellen. In fact, he knew she would<br> never recover should she learn that her daughters had been exposed<br> to so frank a conversation. But Mrs. Tarleton was, as usual, deaf<br> to all other ideas when pursuing her favorite topic, breeding,<br> whether it be horses or humans.<br><br> ‘I know what I'm talking about because I had some cousins who<br> married each other and I give you my word their children all<br> turned out as popeyed as bullfrogs, poor things. And when my<br> family wanted me to marry a second cousin, I bucked like a colt.<br> I said, 'No, Ma. Not for me. My children will all have spavins<br> and heaves.' Well, Ma fainted when I said that about spavins, but<br> I stood firm and Grandma backed me up. She knew a lot about horse<br> breeding too, you see, and said I was right. And she helped me<br> run away with Mr. Tarleton. And look at my children! Big and<br> healthy and not a sickly one or a runt among them, though Boyd is<br> only five feet ten. Now, the Wilkes--’<br><br> ‘Not meaning to change the subject, Ma'm,’ broke in Gerald<br> hurriedly, for he had noticed Carreen's bewildered look and the<br> avid curiosity on Suellen's face and feared lest they might ask<br> Ellen embarrassing questions which would reveal how inadequate a<br> chaperon he was. Puss, he was glad to notice, appeared to be<br> thinking of other matters as a lady should.<br><br> Betty Tarleton rescued him from his predicament.<br><br> ‘Good Heavens, Ma, do let's get on!’ she cried impatiently. ‘This<br> sun is broiling me and I can just hear freckles popping out on my<br> neck.’<br><br> ‘Just a minute, Ma'm, before you go,’ said Gerald. ‘But what have<br> you decided to do about selling us the horses for the Troop? War<br> may break any day now and the boys want the matter settled. It's<br> a Clayton County troop and it's Clayton County horses we want for<br> them. But you, obstinate creature that you are, are still<br> refusing to sell us your fine beasts.’<br><br> ‘Maybe there won't be any war,’ Mrs. Tarleton temporized, her mind<br> diverted completely from the Wilkeses' odd marriage habits.<br><br> ‘Why, Ma'm, you can't--’<br><br> ‘Ma,’ Betty interrupted again, ‘can't you and Mr. O'Hara talk<br> about the horses at Twelve Oaks as well as here?’<br><br> ‘That's just it, Miss Betty,’ said Gerald. ‘And I won't be<br> keeping you but one minute by the clock. We'll be getting to<br> Twelve Oaks in a little bit, and every man there, old and young,<br> wanting to know about the horses. Ah, but it's breaking me heart<br> to see such a fine pretty lady as your mother so stingy with her<br> beasts! Now, where's your patriotism, Mrs. Tarleton? Does the<br> Confederacy mean nothing to you at all?’<br><br> ‘Ma,’ cried small Betsy, ‘Randa's sitting on my dress and I'm<br> getting all wrinkled.’<br><br> ‘Well, push Randa off you, Betsy, and hush. Now, listen to me,<br> Gerald O'Hara,’ she retorted, her eyes beginning to snap. ‘Don't<br> you go throwing the Confederacy in my face! I reckon the<br> Confederacy means as much to me as it does to you, me with four<br> boys in the Troop and you with none. But my boys can take care of<br> themselves and my horses can't. I'd gladly give the horses free<br> of charge if I knew they were going to be ridden by boys I know,<br> gentlemen used to thoroughbreds. No, I wouldn't hesitate a<br> minute. But let my beauties be at the mercy of back-woodsmen and<br> Crackers who are used to riding mules! No, sir! I'd have<br> nightmares thinking they were being ridden with saddle galls and<br> not groomed properly. Do you think I'd let ignorant fools ride my<br> tender-mouthed darlings and saw their mouths to pieces and beat<br> them till their spirits were broken? Why, I've got goose flesh<br> this minute, just thinking about it! No, Mr. O'Hara, you're<br> mighty nice to want my horses, but you'd better go to Atlanta and<br> buy some old plugs for your clodhoppers. They'll never know the<br> difference.’<br><br> ‘Ma, can't we please go on?’ asked Camilla, joining the impatient<br> chorus. ‘You know mighty well you're going to end up giving them<br> your darlings anyhow. When Pa and the boys get through talking<br> about the Confederacy needing them and so on, you'll cry and let<br> them go.’<br><br> Mrs. Tarleton grinned and shook the lines.<br><br> ‘I'll do no such thing,’ she said, touching the horses lightly<br> with the whip. The carriage went off swiftly.<br><br> ‘That's a fine woman,’ said Gerald, putting on his hat and taking<br> his place beside his own carriage. ‘Drive on, Toby. We'll wear<br> her down and get the horses yet. Of course, she's right. She's<br> right. If a man's not a gentleman, he's no business on a horse.<br> The infantry is the place for him. But more's the pity, there's<br> not enough planters' sons in this County to make up a full troop.<br> What did you say, Puss?’<br><br> ‘Pa, please ride behind us or in front of us. You kick up such a<br> heap of dust that we're choking,’ said Scarlett, who felt that she<br> could endure conversation no longer. It distracted her from her<br> thoughts and she was very anxious to arrange both her thoughts and<br> her face in attractive lines before reaching Twelve Oaks. Gerald<br> obediently put spurs to his horse and was off in a red cloud after<br> the Tarleton carriage where he could continue his horsy conversation.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER VI<br><br> <br> They crossed the river and the carriage mounted the hill. Even<br> before Twelve Oaks came into view Scarlett saw a haze of smoke<br> hanging lazily in the tops of the tall trees and smelled the<br> mingled savory odors of burning hickory logs and roasting pork and<br> mutton.<br><br> The barbecue pits, which had been slowly burning since last night,<br> would now be long troughs of rose-red embers, with the meats<br> turning on spits above them and the juices trickling down and<br> hissing into the coals. Scarlett knew that the fragrance carried<br> on the faint breeze came from the grove of great oaks in the rear<br> of the big house. John Wilkes always held his barbecues there, on<br> the gentle slope leading down to the rose garden, a pleasant shady<br> place and a far pleasanter place, for instance, than that used by<br> the Calverts. Mrs. Calvert did not like barbecue food and<br> declared that the smells remained in the house for days, so her<br> guests always sweltered on a flat unshaded spot a quarter of a<br> mile from the house. But John Wilkes, famed throughout the state<br> for his hospitality, really knew how to give a barbecue.<br><br> The long trestled picnic tables, covered with the finest of the<br> Wilkeses' linen, always stood under the thickest shade, with<br> backless benches on either side; and chairs, hassocks and cushions<br> from the house were scattered about the glade for those who did<br> not fancy the benches. At a distance great enough to keep the<br> smoke away from the guests were the long pits where the meats<br> cooked and the huge iron wash-pots from which the succulent odors<br> of barbecue sauce and Brunswick stew floated. Mr. Wilkes always<br> had at least a dozen darkies busy running back and forth with<br> trays to serve the guests. Over behind the barns there was always<br> another barbecue pit, where the house servants and the coachmen<br> and maids of the guests had their own feast of hoecakes and yams<br> and chitterlings, that dish of hog entrails so dear to negro<br> hearts, and, in season, watermelons enough to satiate.<br><br> As the smell of crisp fresh pork came to her, Scarlett wrinkled<br> her nose appreciatively, hoping that by the time it was cooked she<br> would feel some appetite. As it was she was so full of food and<br> so tightly laced that she feared every moment she was going to<br> belch. That would be fatal, as only old men and very old ladies<br> could belch without fear of social disapproval.<br><br> They topped the rise and the white house reared its perfect<br> symmetry before her, tall of columns, wide of verandas, flat of<br> roof, beautiful as a woman is beautiful who is so sure of her<br> charm that she can be generous and gracious to all. Scarlett<br> loved Twelve Oaks even more than Tara, for it had a stately<br> beauty, a mellowed dignity that Gerald's house did not possess.<br><br> The wide curving driveway was full of saddle horses and carriages<br> and guests alighting and calling greetings to friends. Grinning<br> negroes, excited as always at a party, were leading the animals to<br> the barnyard to be unharnessed and unsaddled for the day. Swarms<br> of children, black and white, ran yelling about the newly green<br> lawn, playing hopscotch and tag and boasting how much they were<br> going to eat. The wide hall which ran from front to back of the<br> house was swarming with people, and as the O'Hara carriage drew up<br> at the front steps, Scarlett saw girls in crinolines, bright as<br> butterflies, going up and coming down the stairs from the second<br> floor, arms about each other's waists, stopping to lean over the<br> delicate handrail of the banisters, laughing and calling to young<br> men in the hall below them.<br><br> Through the open French windows, she caught glimpses of the older<br> women seated in the drawing room, sedate in dark silks as they sat<br> fanning themselves and talking of babies and sicknesses and who<br> had married whom and why. The Wilkes butler, Tom, was hurrying<br> through the halls, a silver tray in his hands, bowing and<br> grinning, as he offered tall glasses to young men in fawn and gray<br> trousers and fine ruffled linen shirts.<br><br> The sunny front veranda was thronged with guests. Yes, the whole<br> County was here, thought Scarlett. The four Tarleton boys and<br> their father leaned against the tall columns, the twins, Stuart<br> and Brent, side by side inseparable as usual, Boyd and Tom with<br> their father, James Tarleton. Mr. Calvert was standing close by<br> the side of his Yankee wife, who even after fifteen years in<br> Georgia never seemed to quite belong anywhere. Everyone was very<br> polite and kind to her because he felt sorry for her, but no one<br> could forget that she had compounded her initial error of birth by<br> being the governess of Mr. Calvert's children. The two Calvert<br> boys, Raiford and Cade, were there with their dashing blonde<br> sister, Cathleen, teasing the dark-faced Joe Fontaine and Sally<br> Munroe, his pretty bride-to-be. Alex and Tony Fontaine were<br> whispering in the ears of Dimity Munroe and sending her into gales<br> of giggles. There were families from as far as Lovejoy, ten miles<br> away, and from Fayetteville and Jonesboro, a few even from Atlanta<br> and Macon. The house seemed bursting with the crowd, and a<br> ceaseless babble of talking and laughter and giggles and shrill<br> feminine squeaks and screams rose and fell.<br><br> On the porch steps stood John Wilkes, silver-haired, erect,<br> radiating the quiet charm and hospitality that was as warm and<br> never failing as the sun of Georgia summer. Beside him Honey<br> Wilkes, so called because she indiscriminately addressed everyone<br> from her father to the field hands by that endearment, fidgeted<br> and giggled as she called greetings to the arriving guests.<br><br> Honey's nervously obvious desire to be attractive to every man in<br> sight contrasted sharply with her father's poise, and Scarlett had<br> the thought that perhaps there was something in what Mrs. Tarleton<br> said, after all. Certainly the Wilkes men got the family looks.<br> The thick deep-gold lashes that set off the gray eyes of John<br> Wilkes and Ashley were sparse and colorless in the faces of Honey<br> and her sister India. Honey had the odd lashless look of a<br> rabbit, and India could be described by no other word than plain.<br><br> India was nowhere to be seen, but Scarlett knew she probably was<br> in the kitchen giving final instructions to the servants. Poor<br> India, thought Scarlett, she's had so much trouble keeping house<br> since her mother died that she's never had the chance to catch any<br> beau except Stuart Tarleton, and it certainly wasn't my fault if<br> he thought I was prettier than she.<br><br> John Wilkes came down the steps to offer his arm to Scarlett. As<br> she descended from the carriage, she saw Suellen smirk and knew<br> that she must have picked out Frank Kennedy in the crowd.<br><br> If I couldn't catch a better beau than that old maid in britches!<br> she thought contemptuously, as she stepped to the ground and<br> smiled her thanks to John Wilkes.<br><br> Frank Kennedy was hurrying to the carriage to assist Suellen, and<br> Suellen was bridling in a way that made Scarlett want to slap her.<br> Frank Kennedy might own more land than anyone in the County and he<br> might have a very kind heart, but these things counted for nothing<br> against the fact that he was forty, slight and nervous and had a<br> thin ginger-colored beard and an old-maidish, fussy way about him.<br> However, remembering her plan, Scarlett smothered her contempt and<br> cast such a flashing smile of greeting at him that he stopped<br> short, his arm outheld to Suellen and goggled at Scarlett in<br> pleased bewilderment.<br><br> Scarlett's eyes searched the crowd for Ashley, even while she made<br> pleasant small talk with John Wilkes, but he was not on the porch.<br> There were cries of greeting from a dozen voices and Stuart and<br> Brent Tarleton moved toward her. The Munroe girls rushed up to<br> exclaim over her dress, and she was speedily the center of a<br> circle of voices that rose higher and higher in efforts to be<br> heard above the din. But where was Ashley? And Melanie and<br> Charles? She tried not to be obvious as she looked about and<br> peered down the hall into the laughing group inside.<br><br> As she chattered and laughed and cast quick glances into the house<br> and the yard, her eyes fell on a stranger, standing alone in the<br> hall, staring at her in a cool impertinent way that brought her up<br> sharply with a mingled feeling of feminine pleasure that she had<br> attracted a man and an embarrassed sensation that her dress was<br> too low in the bosom. He looked quite old, at least thirty-five.<br> He was a tall man and powerfully built. Scarlett thought she had<br> never seen a man with such wide shoulders, so heavy with muscles,<br> almost too heavy for gentility. When her eye caught his, he<br> smiled, showing animal-white teeth below a close-clipped black<br> mustache. He was dark of face, swarthy as a pirate, and his eyes<br> were as bold and black as any pirate's appraising a galleon to be<br> scuttled or a maiden to be ravished. There was a cool recklessness<br> in his face and a cynical humor in his mouth as he smiled at her,<br> and Scarlett caught her breath. She felt that she should be<br> insulted by such a look and was annoyed with herself because she did<br> not feel insulted. She did not know who he could be, but there was<br> undeniably a look of good blood in his dark face. It showed in the<br> thin hawk nose over the full red lips, the high forehead and the<br> wide-set eyes.<br><br> She dragged her eyes away from his without smiling back, and he<br> turned as someone called: ‘Rhett! Rhett Butler! Come here! I<br> want you to meet the most hardhearted girl in Georgia.’<br><br> Rhett Butler? The name had a familiar sound, somehow connected<br> with something pleasantly scandalous, but her mind was on Ashley<br> and she dismissed the thought.<br><br> ‘I must run upstairs and smooth my hair,’ she told Stuart and<br> Brent, who were trying to get her cornered from the crowd. ‘You<br> boys wait for me and don't run off with any other girl or I'll be<br> furious.’<br><br> She could see that Stuart was going to be difficult to handle<br> today if she flirted with anyone else. He had been drinking and<br> wore the arrogant looking-for-a-fight expression that she knew from<br> experience meant trouble. She paused in the hall to speak to<br> friends and to greet India who was emerging from the back of the<br> house, her hair untidy and tiny beads of perspiration on her<br> forehead. Poor India! It would be bad enough to have pale hair<br> and eyelashes and a jutting chin that meant a stubborn disposition,<br> without being twenty years old and an old maid in the bargain. She<br> wondered if India resented very much her taking Stuart away from<br> her. Lots of people said she was still in love with him, but then<br> you could never tell what a Wilkes was thinking about. If she did<br> resent it, she never gave any sign of it, treating Scarlett with the<br> same slightly aloof, kindly courtesy she had always shown her.<br><br> Scarlett spoke pleasantly to her and started up the wide stairs.<br> As she did, a shy voice behind her called her name and, turning,<br> she saw Charles Hamilton. He was a nice-looking boy with a riot<br> of soft brown curls on his white forehead and eyes as deep brown,<br> as clean and as gentle as a collie dog's. He was well turned out<br> in mustard-colored trousers and black coat and his pleated shirt<br> was topped by the widest and most fashionable of black cravats.<br> A faint blush was creeping over his face as she turned for he was<br> timid with girls. Like most shy men he greatly admired airy,<br> vivacious, always-at-ease girls like Scarlett. She had never<br> given him more than perfunctory courtesy before, and so the<br> beaming smile of pleasure with which she greeted him and the two<br> hands outstretched to his almost took his breath away.<br><br> ‘Why Charles Hamilton, you handsome old thing, you! I'll bet you<br> came all the way down here from Atlanta just to break my poor<br> heart!’<br><br> Charles almost stuttered with excitement, holding her warm little<br> hands in his and looking into the dancing green eyes. This was<br> the way girls talked to other boys but never to him. He never<br> knew why but girls always treated him like a younger brother and<br> were very kind, but never bothered to tease him. He had always<br> wanted girls to flirt and frolic with him as they did with boys<br> much less handsome and less endowed with this world's goods than<br> he. But on the few occasions when this had happened he could<br> never think of anything to say and he suffered agonies of<br> embarrassment at his dumbness. Then he lay awake at night<br> thinking of all the charming gallantries he might have employed;<br> but he rarely got a second chance, for the girls left him alone<br> after a trial or two.<br><br> Even with Honey, with whom he had an unspoken understanding of<br> marriage when he came into his property next fall, he was<br> diffident and silent. At times, he had an ungallant feeling that<br> Honey's coquetries and proprietary airs were no credit to him, for<br> she was so boy-crazy he imagined she would use them on any man who<br> gave her the opportunity. Charles was not excited over the<br> prospect of marrying her, for she stirred in him none of the<br> emotions of wild romance that his beloved books had assured him<br> were proper for a lover. He had always yearned to be loved by<br> some beautiful, dashing creature full of fire and mischief.<br><br> And here was Scarlett O'Hara teasing him about breaking her heart!<br><br> He tried to think of something to say and couldn't, and silently<br> he blessed her because she kept up a steady chatter which relieved<br> him of any necessity for conversation. It was too good to be<br> true.<br><br> ‘Now, you wait right here till I come back, for I want to eat<br> barbecue with you. And don't you go off philandering with those<br> other girls, because I'm mighty jealous,’ came the incredible<br> words from red lips with a dimple on each side; and briskly black<br> lashes swept demurely over green eyes.<br><br> ‘I won't,’ he finally managed to breathe, never dreaming that she<br> was thinking he looked like a calf waiting for the butcher.<br><br> Tapping him lightly on the arm with her folded fan, she turned to<br> start up the stairs and her eyes again fell on the man called<br> Rhett Butler who stood alone a few feet away from Charles.<br> Evidently he had overheard the whole conversation, for he grinned<br> up at her as maliciously as a tomcat, and again his eyes went over<br> her, in a gaze totally devoid of the deference she was accustomed<br> to.<br><br> ‘God's nightgown!’ said Scarlett to herself in indignation, using<br> Gerald's favorite oath. ‘He looks as if--as if he knew what I<br> looked like without my shimmy,’ and, tossing her head, she went up<br> the steps.<br><br> In the bedroom where the wraps were laid, she found Cathleen<br> Calvert preening before the mirror and biting her lips to make<br> them look redder. There were fresh roses in her sash that matched<br> her cheeks, and her cornflower-blue eyes were dancing with<br> excitement.<br><br> ‘Cathleen,’ said Scarlett, trying to pull the corsage of her dress<br> higher, ‘who is that nasty man downstairs named Butler?’<br><br> ‘My dear, don't you know?’ whispered Cathleen excitedly, a weather<br> eye on the next room where Dilcey and the Wilkes girls' mammy were<br> gossiping. ‘I can't imagine how Mr. Wilkes must feel having him<br> here, but he was visiting Mr. Kennedy in Jonesboro--something<br> about buying cotton--and, of course, Mr. Kennedy had to bring him<br> along with him. He couldn't just go off and leave him.’<br><br> ‘What is the matter with him?’<br><br> ‘My dear, he isn't received!’<br><br> ‘Not really!’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> Scarlett digested this in silence, for she had never before been<br> under the same roof with anyone who was not received. It was very<br> exciting.<br><br> ‘What did he do?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett, he has the most terrible reputation. His name is<br> Rhett Butler and he's from Charleston and his folks are some of<br> the nicest people there, but they won't even speak to him. Caro<br> Rhett told me about him last summer. He isn't any kin to her<br> family, but she knows all about him, everybody does. He was<br> expelled from West Point. Imagine! And for things too bad for<br> Caro to know. And then there was that business about the girl he<br> didn't marry.’<br><br> ‘Do tell me!’<br><br> ‘Darling, don't you know anything? Caro told me all about it last<br> summer and her mama would die if she thought Caro even knew about<br> it. Well, this Mr. Butler took a Charleston girl out buggy<br> riding. I never did know who she was, but I've got my suspicions.<br> She couldn't have been very nice or she wouldn't have gone out<br> with him in the late afternoon without a chaperon. And, my dear,<br> they stayed out nearly all night and walked home finally, saying<br> the horse had run away and smashed the buggy and they had gotten<br> lost in the woods. And guess what--’<br><br> ‘I can't guess. Tell me,’ said Scarlett enthusiastically, hoping<br> for the worst.<br><br> ‘He refused to marry her the next day!’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ said Scarlett, her hopes dashed.<br><br> ‘He said he hadn't--er--done anything to her and he didn't see why<br> he should marry her. And, of course, her brother called him out,<br> and Mr. Butler said he'd rather be shot than marry a stupid fool.<br> And so they fought a duel and Mr. Butler shot the girl's brother<br> and he died, and Mr. Butler had to leave Charleston and now nobody<br> receives him,’ finished Cathleen triumphantly, and just in time,<br> for Dilcey came back into the room to oversee the toilet of her<br> charge.<br><br> ‘Did she have a baby?’ whispered Scarlett in Cathleen's ear.<br><br> Cathleen shook her head violently. ‘But she was ruined just the<br> same,’ she hissed back.<br><br> I wish I had gotten Ashley to compromise me, thought Scarlett<br> suddenly. He'd be too much of a gentleman not to marry me. But<br> somehow, unbidden, she had a feeling of respect for Rhett Butler<br> for refusing to marry a girl who was a fool.<br><br> <br><br> Scarlett sat on a high rosewood ottoman, under the shade of a huge<br> oak in the rear of the house, her flounces and ruffles billowing<br> about her and two inches of green morocco slippers--all that a<br> lady could show and still remain a lady--peeping from beneath<br> them. She had scarcely touched plate in her hands and seven<br> cavaliers about her. The barbecue had reached its peak and the<br> warm air was full of laughter and talk, the click of silver on<br> porcelain and the rich heavy smells of roasting meats and redolent<br> gravies. Occasionally when the slight breeze veered, puffs of<br> smoke from the long barbecue pits floated over the crowd and were<br> greeted with squeals of mock dismay from the ladies and violent<br> flappings of palmetto fans.<br><br> Most of the young ladies were seated with partners on the long<br> benches that faced the tables, but Scarlett, realizing that a girl<br> has only two sides and only one man can sit on each of these<br> sides, had elected to sit apart so she could gather about her as<br> many men as possible.<br><br> Under the arbor sat the married women, their dark dresses decorous<br> notes in the surrounding color and gaiety. Matrons, regardless of<br> their ages, always grouped together apart from the bright-eyed<br> girls, beaux and laughter, for there were no married belles in the<br> South. From Grandma Fontaine, who was belching frankly with the<br> privilege of her age, to seventeen-year-old Alice Munroe,<br> struggling against the nausea of a first pregnancy, they had their<br> heads together in the endless genealogical and obstetrical<br> discussions that made such gatherings very pleasant and<br> instructive affairs.<br><br> Casting contemptuous glances at them, Scarlett thought that they<br> looked like a clump of fat crows. Married women never had any<br> fun. It did not occur to her that if she married Ashley she would<br> automatically be relegated to arbors and front parlors with staid<br> matrons in dull silks, as staid and dull as they and not a part of<br> the fun and frolicking. Like most girls, her imagination carried<br> her just as far as the altar and no further. Besides, she was too<br> unhappy now to pursue an abstraction.<br><br> She dropped her eyes to her plate and nibbled daintily on a beaten<br> biscuit with an elegance and an utter lack of appetite that would<br> have won Mammy's approval. For all that she had a superfluity of<br> beaux, she had never been more miserable in her life. In some way<br> that she could not understand, her plans of last night had failed<br> utterly so far as Ashley was concerned. She had attracted other<br> beaux by the dozens, but not Ashley, and all the fears of<br> yesterday afternoon were sweeping back upon her, making her heart<br> beat fast and then slow, and color flame and whiten in her cheeks.<br><br> Ashley had made no attempt to join the circle about her, in fact<br> she had not had a word alone with him since arriving, or even<br> spoken to him since their first greeting. He had come forward to<br> welcome her when she came into the back garden, but Melanie had<br> been on his arm then, Melanie who hardly came up to his shoulder.<br><br> She was a tiny, frailly built girl, who gave the appearance of a<br> child masquerading in her mother's enormous hoop skirts--an<br> illusion that was heightened by the shy, almost frightened look in<br> her too large brown eyes. She had a cloud of curly dark hair<br> which was so sternly repressed beneath its net that no vagrant<br> tendrils escaped, and this dark mass, with its long widow's peak,<br> accentuated the heart shape of her face. Too wide across the<br> cheek bones, too pointed at the chin, it was a sweet, timid face<br> but a plain face, and she had no feminine tricks of allure to make<br> observers forget its plainness. She looked--and was--as simple as<br> earth, as good as bread, as transparent as spring water. But for<br> all her plainness of feature and smallness of stature, there was a<br> sedate dignity about her movements that was oddly touching and far<br> older than her seventeen years.<br><br> Her gray organdie dress, with its cherry-colored satin sash,<br> disguised with its billows and ruffles how childishly undeveloped<br> her body was, and the yellow hat with long cherry streamers made<br> her creamy skin glow. Her heavy earbobs with their long gold<br> fringe hung down from loops of tidily netted hair, swinging close<br> to her brown eyes, eyes that had the still gleam of a forest pool<br> in winter when brown leaves shine up through quiet water.<br><br> She had smiled with timid liking when she greeted Scarlett and<br> told her how pretty her green dress was, and Scarlett had been<br> hard put to be even civil in reply, so violently did she want to<br> speak alone with Ashley. Since then, Ashley had sat on a stool at<br> Melanie's feet, apart from the other guests, and talked quietly<br> with her, smiling the slow drowsy smile that Scarlett loved. What<br> made matters worse was that under his smile a little sparkle had<br> come into Melanie's eyes, so that even Scarlett had to admit that<br> she looked almost pretty. As Melanie looked at Ashley, her plain<br> face lit up as with an inner fire, for if ever a loving heart<br> showed itself upon a face, it was showing now on Melanie<br> Hamilton's.<br><br> Scarlett tried to keep her eyes from these two but could not, and<br> after each glance she redoubled her gaiety with her cavaliers,<br> laughing, saying daring things, teasing, tossing her head at their<br> compliments until her earrings danced. She said ‘fiddle-dee-dee’<br> many times, declared that the truth wasn't in any of them, and<br> vowed that she'd never believe anything any man told her. But<br> Ashley did not seem to notice her at all. He only looked up at<br> Melanie and talked on, and Melanie looked down at him with an<br> expression that radiated the fact that she belonged to him.<br><br> So, Scarlett was miserable.<br><br> To the outward eye, never had a girl less cause to be miserable.<br> She was undoubtedly the belle of the barbecue, the center of<br> attention. The furore she was causing among the men, coupled with<br> the heart burnings of the other girls, would have pleased her<br> enormously at any other time.<br><br> Charles Hamilton, emboldened by her notice, was firmly planted on<br> her right, refusing to be dislodged by the combined efforts of the<br> Tarleton twins. He held her fan in one hand and his untouched<br> plate of barbecue in the other and stubbornly refused to meet the<br> eyes of Honey, who seemed on the verge of an outburst of tears.<br> Cade lounged gracefully on her left, plucking at her skirt to<br> attract her attention and staring up with smoldering eyes at<br> Stuart. Already the air was electric between him and the twins<br> and rude words had passed. Frank Kennedy fussed about like a hen<br> with one chick, running back and forth from the shade of the oak<br> to the tables to fetch dainties to tempt Scarlett, as if there<br> were not a dozen servants there for that purpose. As a result,<br> Suellen's sullen resentment had passed beyond the point of<br> ladylike concealment and she glowered at Scarlett. Small Carreen<br> could have cried because, for all Scarlett's encouraging words<br> that morning, Brent had done no more than say ‘Hello, Sis’ and<br> jerk her hair ribbon before turning his full attention to<br> Scarlett. Usually he was so kind and treated her with a careless<br> deference that made her feel grown up, and Carreen secretly<br> dreamed of the day when she would put her hair up and her skirts<br> down and receive him as a real beau. And now it seemed that<br> Scarlett had him. The Munroe girls were concealing their chagrin<br> at the defection of the swarthy Fontaine boys, but they were<br> annoyed at the way Tony and Alex stood about the circle, jockeying<br> for a position near Scarlett should any of the others arise from<br> their places.<br><br> They telegraphed their disapproval of Scarlett's conduct to Hetty<br> Tarleton by delicately raised eyebrows. ‘Fast’ was the only word<br> for Scarlett. Simultaneously, the three young ladies raised lacy<br> parasols, said they had had quite enough to eat, thank you, and,<br> laying light fingers on the arms of the men nearest them, clamored<br> sweetly to see the rose garden, the spring and the summerhouse.<br> This strategic retreat in good order was not lost on a woman<br> present or observed by a man.<br><br> Scarlett giggled as she saw three men dragged out of the line of<br> her charms to investigate landmarks familiar to the girls from<br> childhood, and cut her eye sharply to see if Ashley had taken<br> note. But he was playing with the ends of Melanie's sash and<br> smiling up at her. Pain twisted Scarlett's heart. She felt that<br> she could claw Melanie's ivory skin till the blood ran and take<br> pleasure in doing it.<br><br> As her eyes wandered from Melanie, she caught the gaze of Rhett<br> Butler, who was not mixing with the crowd but standing apart<br> talking to John Wilkes. He had been watching her and when she<br> looked at him he laughed outright. Scarlett had an uneasy feeling<br> that this man who was not received was the only one present who<br> knew what lay behind her wild gaiety and that it was affording him<br> sardonic amusement. She could have clawed him with pleasure too.<br><br> ‘If I can just live through this barbecue till this afternoon,’<br> she thought, ‘all the girls will go upstairs to take naps to be<br> fresh for tonight and I'll stay downstairs and get to talk to<br> Ashley. Surely he must have noticed how popular I am.’ She<br> soothed her heart with another hope: ‘Of course, he has to be<br> attentive to Melanie because, after all, she is his cousin and she<br> isn't popular at all, and if he didn't look out for her she'd just<br> be a wallflower.’<br><br> She took new courage at this thought and redoubled her efforts in<br> the direction of Charles, whose brown eyes glowed down eagerly at<br> her. It was a wonderful day for Charles, a dream day, and he had<br> fallen in love with Scarlett with no effort at all. Before this<br> new emotion, Honey receded into a dim haze. Honey was a shrill-<br> voiced sparrow and Scarlett a gleaming hummingbird. She teased<br> him and favored him and asked him questions and answered them<br> herself, so that he appeared very clever without having to say a<br> word. The other boys were puzzled and annoyed by her obvious<br> interest in him, for they knew Charles was too shy to hitch two<br> consecutive words together, and politeness was being severely<br> strained to conceal their growing rage. Everyone was smoldering,<br> and it would have been a positive triumph for Scarlett, except for<br> Ashley.<br><br> When the last forkful of pork and chicken and mutton had been<br> eaten, Scarlett hoped the time had come when India would rise and<br> suggest that the ladies retire to the house. It was two o'clock<br> and the sun was warm overhead, but India, wearied with the three-<br> day preparations for the barbecue, was only too glad to remain<br> sitting beneath the arbor, shouting remarks to a deaf old<br> gentleman from Fayetteville.<br><br> A lazy somnolence descended on the crowd. The negroes idled<br> about, clearing the long tables on which the food had been laid.<br> The laughter and talking became less animated and groups here and<br> there fell silent. All were waiting for their hostess to signal<br> the end of the morning's festivities. Palmetto fans were wagging<br> more slowly, and several gentlemen were nodding from the heat and<br> overloaded stomachs. The barbecue was over and all were content<br> to take their ease while sun was at its height.<br><br> In this interval between the morning party and the evening's ball,<br> they seemed a placid, peaceful lot. Only the young men retained<br> the restless energy which had filled the whole throng a short<br> while before. Moving from group to group, drawling in their soft<br> voices, they were as handsome as blooded stallions and as<br> dangerous. The languor of midday had taken hold of the gathering,<br> but underneath lurked tempers that could rise to killing heights<br> in a second and flare out as quickly. Men and women, they were<br> beautiful and wild, all a little violent under their pleasant ways<br> and only a little tamed.<br><br> Some time dragged by while the sun grew hotter, and Scarlett and<br> others looked again toward India. Conversation was dying out<br> when, in the lull, everyone in the grove heard Gerald's voice<br> raised in furious accents. Standing some little distance away<br> from the barbecue tables, he was at the peak of an argument with<br> John Wilkes.<br><br> ‘God's nightgown, man! Pray for a peaceable settlement with the<br> Yankees after we've fired on the rascals at Fort Sumter?<br> Peaceable? The South should show by arms that she cannot be<br> insulted and that she is not leaving the Union by the Union's<br> kindness but by her own strength!’<br><br> ‘Oh, my God!’ thought Scarlett. ‘He's done it! Now, we'll all<br> sit here till midnight.’<br><br> In an instant, the somnolence had fled from the lounging throng<br> and something electric went snapping through the air. The men<br> sprang from benches and chairs, arms in wide gestures, voices<br> clashing for the right to be heard above other voices. There had<br> been no talk of politics or impending war all during the morning,<br> because of Mr. Wilkes' request that the ladies should not be<br> bored. But now Gerald had bawled the words ‘Fort Sumter,’ and<br> every man present forgot his host's admonition.<br><br> ‘Of course we'll fight--’ ‘Yankee thieves--’ ‘We could lick them<br> in a month--’ ‘Why, one Southerner can lick twenty Yankees--’<br> ‘Teach them a lesson they won't soon forget--’ ‘Peaceably? They<br> won't let us go in peace--’ ‘No, look how Mr. Lincoln insulted<br> our Commissioners!’ ‘Yes, kept them hanging around for weeks--<br> swearing he'd have Sumter evacuated!’ ‘They want war; we'll make<br> them sick of war--’ And above all the voices, Gerald's boomed.<br> All Scarlett could hear was ‘States' rights, by God!’ shouted over<br> and over. Gerald was having an excellent time, but not his<br> daughter.<br><br> Secession, war--these words long since had become acutely boring<br> to Scarlett from much repetition, but now she hated the sound of<br> them, for they meant that the men would stand there for hours<br> haranguing one another and she would have no chance to corner<br> Ashley. Of course there would be no war and the men all knew it.<br> They just loved to talk and hear themselves talk.<br><br> Charles Hamilton had not risen with the others and, finding<br> himself comparatively alone with Scarlett, he leaned closer and,<br> with the daring born of new love, whispered a confession.<br><br> ‘Miss O'Hara--I--I had already decided that if we did fight, I'd<br> go over to South Carolina and join a troop there. It's said that<br> Mr. Wade Hampton is organizing a cavalry troop, and of course I<br> would want to go with him. He's a splendid person and was my<br> father's best friend.’<br><br> Scarlett thought, ‘What am I supposed to do--give three cheers?’<br> for Charles' expression showed that he was baring his heart's<br> secrets to her. She could think of nothing to say and so merely<br> looked at him, wondering why men were such fools as to think women<br> interested in such matters. He took her expression to mean<br> stunned approbation and went on rapidly, daringly--<br><br> ‘If I went--would--would you be sorry, Miss O'Hara?’<br><br> ‘I should cry into my pillow every night,’ said Scarlett, meaning<br> to be flippant, but he took the statement at face value and went<br> red with pleasure. Her hand was concealed in the folds of her<br> dress and he cautiously wormed his hand to it and squeezed it,<br> overwhelmed at his own boldness and at her acquiescence.<br><br> ‘Would you pray for me?’<br><br> ‘What a fool!’ thought Scarlett bitterly, casting a surreptitious<br> glance about her in the hope of being rescued from the conversation.<br><br> ‘Would you?’<br><br> ‘Oh--yes, indeed, Mr. Hamilton. Three Rosaries a night, at<br> least!’<br><br> Charles gave a swift look about him, drew in his breath, stiffened<br> the muscles of his stomach. They were practically alone and he<br> might never get another such opportunity. And, even given another<br> such Godsent occasion, his courage might fail him.<br><br> ‘Miss O'Hara--I must tell you something. I--I love you!’<br><br> ‘Um?’ said Scarlett absently, trying to peer through the crowd of<br> arguing men to where Ashley still sat talking at Melanie's feet.<br><br> ‘Yes!’ whispered Charles, in a rapture that she had neither<br> laughed, screamed nor fainted, as he had always imagined young<br> girls did under such circumstances. ‘I love you! You are the<br> most--the most--’ and he found his tongue for the first time in<br> his life. ‘The most beautiful girl I've ever known and the<br> sweetest and the kindest, and you have the dearest ways and I love<br> you with all my heart. I cannot hope that you could love anyone<br> like me but, my dear Miss O'Hara, if you can give me any<br> encouragement, I will do anything in the world to make you love<br> me. I will--’<br><br> Charles stopped, for he couldn't think of anything difficult<br> enough of accomplishment to really prove to Scarlett the depth of<br> his feeling, so he said simply: ‘I want to marry you.’<br><br> Scarlett came back to earth with a jerk, at the sound of the word<br> ‘marry.’ She had been thinking of marriage and of Ashley, and she<br> looked at Charles with poorly concealed irritation. Why must this<br> calf-like fool intrude his feelings on this particular day when<br> she was so worried she was about to lose her mind? She looked<br> into the pleading brown eyes and she saw none of the beauty of a<br> shy boy's first love, of the adoration of an ideal come true or<br> the wild happiness and tenderness that were sweeping through him<br> like a flame. Scarlett was used to men asking her to marry them,<br> men much more attractive than Charles Hamilton, and men who had<br> more finesse than to propose at a barbecue when she had more<br> important matters on her mind. She only saw a boy of twenty, red<br> as a beet and looking very silly. She wished that she could tell<br> him how silly he looked. But automatically, the words Ellen had<br> taught her to say in such emergencies rose to her lips and casting<br> down her eyes, from force of long habit, she murmured: ‘Mr.<br> Hamilton, I am not unaware of the honor you have bestowed on me in<br> wanting me to become your wife, but this is all so sudden that I<br> do not know what to say.’<br><br> That was a neat way of smoothing a man's vanity and yet keeping<br> him on the string, and Charles rose to it as though such bait were<br> new and he the first to swallow it.<br><br> ‘I would wait forever! I wouldn't want you unless you were quite<br> sure. Please, Miss O'Hara, tell me that I may hope!’<br><br> ‘Um,’ said Scarlett, her sharp eyes noting that Ashley, who had<br> not risen to take part in the war talk, was smiling up at Melanie.<br> If this fool who was grappling for her hand would only keep quiet<br> for a moment, perhaps she could hear what they were saying. She<br> must hear what they said. What did Melanie say to him that<br> brought that look of interest to his eyes?<br><br> Charles' words blurred the voices she strained to hear.<br><br> ‘Oh, hush!’ she hissed at him, pinching his hand and not even<br> looking at him.<br><br> Startled, at first abashed, Charles blushed at the rebuff and<br> then, seeing how her eyes were fastened on his sister, he smiled.<br> Scarlett was afraid someone might hear his words. She was<br> naturally embarrassed and shy, and in agony lest they be<br> overheard. Charles felt a surge of masculinity such as he had<br> never experienced, for this was the first time in his life that he<br> had ever embarrassed any girl. The thrill was intoxicating. He<br> arranged his face in what he fancied was an expression of careless<br> unconcern and cautiously returned Scarlett's pinch to show that he<br> was man of the world enough to understand and accept her reproof.<br><br> She did not even feel his pinch, for she could hear clearly the<br> sweet voice that was Melanie's chief charm: ‘I fear I cannot<br> agree with you about Mr. Thackeray's works. He is a cynic. I<br> fear he is not the gentleman Mr. Dickens is.’<br><br> What a silly thing to say to a man, thought Scarlett, ready to<br> giggle with relief. Why, she's no more than a bluestocking and<br> everyone knows what men think of bluestockings. . . . The way to<br> get a man interested and to hold his interest was to talk about<br> him, and then gradually lead the conversation around to yourself--<br> and keep it there. Scarlett would have felt some cause for alarm<br> if Melanie had been saying: ‘How wonderful you are!’ or ‘How do<br> you ever think of such things? My little ole brain would bust if<br> I even tried to think about them!’ But here she was, with a man<br> at her feet, talking as seriously as if she were in church. The<br> prospect looked brighter to Scarlett, so bright in fact that she<br> turned beaming eyes on Charles and smiled from pure joy.<br> Enraptured at this evidence of her affection, he grabbed up her<br> fan and plied it so enthusiastically her hair began to blow about<br> untidily.<br><br> ‘Ashley, you have not favored us with your opinion,’ said Jim<br> Tarleton, turning from the group of shouting men, and with an<br> apology Ashley excused himself and rose. There was no one there<br> so handsome, thought Scarlett, as she marked how graceful was his<br> negligent pose and how the sun gleamed on his gold hair and<br> mustache. Even the older men stopped to listen to his words.<br><br> ‘Why, gentlemen, if Georgia fights, I'll go with her. Why else<br> would I have joined the Troop?’ he said. His gray eyes opened<br> wide and their drowsiness disappeared in an intensity that<br> Scarlett had never seen before. ‘But, like Father, I hope the<br> Yankees will let us go in peace and that there will be no<br> fighting--’ He held up his hand with a smile, as a babel of<br> voices from the Fontaine and Tarleton boys began. ‘Yes, yes, I<br> know we've been insulted and lied to--but if we'd been in the<br> Yankees' shoes and they were trying to leave the Union, how would<br> we have acted? Pretty much the same. We wouldn't have liked it.’<br><br> ‘There he goes again,’ thought Scarlett. ‘Always putting himself<br> in the other fellow's shoes.’ To her, there was never but one<br> fair side to an argument. Sometimes, there was no understanding<br> Ashley.<br><br> ‘Let's don't be too hot headed and let's don't have any war. Most<br> of the misery of the world has been caused by wars. And when the<br> wars were over, no one ever knew what they were all about.’<br><br> Scarlett sniffed. Lucky for Ashley that he had an unassailable<br> reputation for courage, or else there'd be trouble. As she<br> thought this, the clamor of dissenting voices rose up about<br> Ashley, indignant, fiery.<br><br> Under the arbor, the deaf old gentleman from Fayetteville punched<br> India.<br><br> ‘What's it all about? What are they saying?’<br><br> ‘War!’ shouted India, cupping her hand to his ear. ‘They want to<br> fight the Yankees!’<br><br> ‘War, is it?’ he cried, fumbling about him for his cane and<br> heaving himself out of his chair with more energy than he had<br> shown in years. ‘I'll tell 'um about war. I've been there.’ It<br> was not often that Mr. McRae had the opportunity to talk about<br> war, the way his women folks shushed him.<br><br> He stumped rapidly to the group, waving his cane and shouting and,<br> because he could not hear the voices about him, he soon had<br> undisputed possession of the field.<br><br> ‘You fire-eating young bucks, listen to me. You don't want to<br> fight. I fought and I know. Went out in the Seminole War and was<br> a big enough fool to go to the Mexican War, too. You all don't<br> know what war is. You think it's riding a pretty horse and having<br> the girls throw flowers at you and coming home a hero. Well, it<br> ain't. No, sir! It's going hungry, and getting the measles and<br> pneumonia from sleeping in the wet. And if it ain't measles and<br> pneumonia, it's your bowels. Yes sir, what war does to a man's<br> bowels--dysentery and things like that--’<br><br> The ladies were pink with blushes. Mr. McRae was a reminder of a<br> cruder era, like Grandma Fontaine and her embarrassingly loud<br> belches, an era everyone would like to forget.<br><br> ‘Run get your grandpa,’ hissed one of the old gentleman's<br> daughters to a young girl standing near by. ‘I declare,’ she<br> whispered to the fluttering matrons about her, ‘he gets worse<br> every day. Would you believe it, this very morning he said to<br> Mary--and she's only sixteen: 'Now, Missy . . .'‘ And the voice<br> went off into a whisper as the granddaughter slipped out to try to<br> induce Mr. McRae to return to his seat in the shade.<br><br> Of all the group that milled about under the trees, girls smiling<br> excitedly, men talking impassionedly, there was only one who<br> seemed calm. Scarlett's eyes turned to Rhett Butler, who leaned<br> against a tree, his hands shoved deep in his trouser pockets. He<br> stood alone, since Mr. Wilkes had left his side, and had uttered<br> no word as the conversation grew hotter. The red lips under the<br> close-clipped black mustache curled down and there was a glint of<br> amused contempt in his black eyes--contempt, as if he listened to<br> the braggings of children. A very disagreeable smile, Scarlett<br> thought. He listened quietly until Stuart Tarleton, his red hair<br> tousled and his eyes gleaming, repeated: ‘Why, we could lick them<br> in a month! Gentlemen always fight better than rabble. A month--<br> why, one battle--’<br><br> ‘Gentlemen,’ said Rhett Butler, in a flat drawl that bespoke his<br> Charleston birth, not moving from his position against the tree or<br> taking his hands from his pockets, ‘may I say a word?’<br><br> There was contempt in his manner as in his eyes, contempt overlaid<br> with an air of courtesy that somehow burlesqued their own manners.<br><br> The group turned toward him and accorded him the politeness always<br> due an outsider.<br><br> ‘Has any one of you gentlemen ever thought that there's not a<br> cannon factory south of the Mason-Dixon Line? Or how few iron<br> foundries there are in the South? Or woolen mills or cotton<br> factories or tanneries? Have you thought that we would not have a<br> single warship and that the Yankee fleet could bottle up our<br> harbors in a week, so that we could not sell our cotton abroad?<br> But--of course--you gentlemen have thought of these things.’<br><br> ‘Why, he means the boys are a passel of fools!’ thought Scarlett<br> indignantly, the hot blood coming to her cheeks.<br><br> Evidently, she was not the only one to whom this idea occurred,<br> for several of the boys were beginning to stick out their chins.<br> John Wilkes casually but swiftly came back to his place beside the<br> speaker, as if to impress on all present that this man was his<br> guest and that, moreover, there were ladies present.<br><br> ‘The trouble with most of us Southerners,’ continued Rhett Butler,<br> ‘is that we either don't travel enough or we don't profit enough<br> by our travels. Now, of course, all you gentlemen are well<br> traveled. But what have you seen? Europe and New York and<br> Philadelphia and, of course, the ladies have been to Saratoga’ (he<br> bowed slightly to the group under the arbor). ‘You've seen the<br> hotels and the museums and the balls and the gambling houses. And<br> you've come home believing that there's no place like the South.<br> As for me, I was Charleston born, but I have spent the last few<br> years in the North.’ His white teeth showed in a grin, as though<br> he realized that everyone present knew just why he no longer lived<br> in Charleston, and cared not at all if they did know. ‘I have<br> seen many things that you all have not seen. The thousands of<br> immigrants who'd be glad to fight for the Yankees for food and a<br> few dollars, the factories, the foundries, the shipyards, the iron<br> and coal mines--all the things we haven't got. Why, all we have<br> is cotton and slaves and arrogance. They'd lick us in a month.’<br><br> For a tense moment, there was silence. Rhett Butler removed a<br> fine linen handkerchief from his coat pocket and idly flicked dust<br> from his sleeve. Then an ominous murmuring arose in the crowd and<br> from under the arbor came a humming as unmistakable as that of a<br> hive of newly disturbed bees. Even while she felt the hot blood<br> of wrath still in her cheeks, something in Scarlett's practical<br> mind prompted the thought that what this man said was right, and<br> it sounded like common sense. Why, she'd never even seen a<br> factory, or known anyone who had seen a factory. But, even if it<br> were true, he was no gentleman to make such a statement--and at a<br> party, too, where everyone was having a good time.<br><br> Stuart Tarleton, brows lowering, came forward with Brent close at<br> his heels. Of course, the Tarleton twins had nice manners and<br> they wouldn't make a scene at a barbecue, even though tremendously<br> provoked. Just the same, all the ladies felt pleasantly excited,<br> for it was so seldom that they actually saw a scene or a quarrel.<br> Usually they had to hear of it third-hand.<br><br> ‘Sir,’ said Stuart heavily, ‘what do you mean?’<br><br> Rhett looked at him with polite but mocking eyes.<br><br> ‘I mean,’ he answered, ‘what Napoleon--perhaps you've heard of<br> him?--remarked once, 'God is on the side of the strongest<br> battalion!'‘ and, turning to John Wilkes, he said with courtesy<br> that was unfeigned: ‘You promised to show me your library, sir.<br> Would it be too great a favor to ask to see it now? I fear I must<br> go back to Jonesboro early this afternoon where a bit of business<br> calls me.’<br><br> He swung about, facing the crowd, clicked his heels together and<br> bowed like a dancing master, a bow that was graceful for so<br> powerful a man, and as full of impertinence as a slap in the face.<br> Then he walked across the lawn with John Wilkes, his black head in<br> the air, and the sound of his discomforting laughter floated back<br> to the group about the tables.<br><br> There was a startled silence and then the buzzing broke out again.<br> India rose tiredly from her seat beneath the arbor and went toward<br> the angry Stuart Tarleton. Scarlett could not hear what she said,<br> but the look in her eyes as she gazed up into his lowering face<br> gave Scarlett something like a twinge of conscience. It was the<br> same look of belonging that Melanie wore when she looked at<br> Ashley, only Stuart did not see it. So India did love him.<br> Scarlett thought for an instant that if she had not flirted so<br> blatantly with Stuart at that political speaking a year ago, he<br> might have married India long ere this. But then the twinge<br> passed with the comforting thought that it wasn't her fault if<br> other girls couldn't keep their men.<br><br> Finally Stuart smiled down at India, an unwilling smile, and<br> nodded his head. Probably India had been pleading with him not to<br> follow Mr. Butler and make trouble. A polite tumult broke out<br> under the trees as the guests arose, shaking crumbs from laps.<br> The married women called to nurses and small children and gathered<br> their broods together to take their departure, and groups of girls<br> started off, laughing and talking, toward the house to exchange<br> gossip in the upstairs bedrooms and to take their naps.<br><br> All the ladies except Mrs. Tarleton moved out of the back yard,<br> leaving the shade of oaks and arbor to the men. She was detained<br> by Gerald, Mr. Calvert and the others who wanted an answer from<br> her about the horses for the Troop.<br><br> Ashley strolled over to where Scarlett and Charles sat, a<br> thoughtful and amused smile on his face.<br><br> ‘Arrogant devil, isn't he?’ he observed, looking after Butler.<br> ‘He looks like one of the Borgias.’<br><br> Scarlett thought quickly but could remember no family in the<br> County or Atlanta or Savannah by that name.<br><br> ‘I don't know them. Is he kin to them? Who are they?’<br><br> An odd look came over Charles' face, incredulity and shame<br> struggling with love. Love triumphed as he realized that it was<br> enough for a girl to be sweet and gentle and beautiful, without<br> having an education to hamper her charms, and he made swift<br> answer: ‘The Borgias were Italians.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ said Scarlett, losing interest, ‘foreigners.’<br><br> She turned her prettiest smile on Ashley, but for some reason he<br> was not looking at her. He was looking at Charles, and there was<br> understanding in his face and a little pity.<br><br> <br><br> Scarlett stood on the landing and peered cautiously over the<br> banisters into the hall below. It was empty. From the bedrooms<br> on the floor above came an unending hum of low voices, rising and<br> falling, punctuated with squeaks of laughter and, ‘Now, you<br> didn't, really!’ and ‘What did he say then?’ On the beds and<br> couches of the six great bedrooms, the girls were resting, their<br> dresses off, their stays loosed, their hair flowing down their<br> backs. Afternoon naps were a custom of the country and never were<br> they so necessary as on the all-day parties, beginning early in<br> the morning and culminating in a ball. For half an hour, the<br> girls would chatter and laugh, and then servants would pull the<br> shutters and in the warm half-gloom the talk would die to whispers<br> and finally expire in silence broken only by soft regular<br> breathing.<br><br> Scarlett had made certain that Melanie was lying down on the bed<br> with Honey and Hetty Tarleton before she slipped into the hall and<br> started down the stairs. From the window on the landing, she<br> could see the group of men sitting under the arbor, drinking from<br> tall glasses, and she knew they would remain there until late<br> afternoon. Her eyes searched the group but Ashley was not among<br> them. Then she listened and she heard his voice. As she had<br> hoped, he was still in the front driveway bidding good-by to<br> departing matrons and children.<br><br> Her heart in her throat, she went swiftly down the stairs. What<br> if she should meet Mr. Wilkes? What excuse could she give for<br> prowling about the house when all the other girls were getting<br> their beauty naps? Well, that had to be risked.<br><br> As she reached the bottom step, she heard the servants moving<br> about in the dining room under the butler's orders, lifting out<br> the table and chairs in preparation for the dancing. Across the<br> wide hall was the open door of the library and she sped into it<br> noiselessly. She could wait there until Ashley finished his<br> adieux and then call to him when he came into the house.<br><br> The library was in semidarkness, for the blinds had been drawn<br> against the sun. The dim room with towering walls completely<br> filled with dark books depressed her. It was not the place which<br> she would have chosen for a tryst such as she hoped this one would<br> be. Large numbers of books always depressed her, as did people<br> who liked to read large numbers of books. That is--all people<br> except Ashley. The heavy furniture rose up at her in the half-<br> light, high-backed chairs with deep seats and wide arms, made for<br> the tall Wilkes men, squatty soft chairs of velvet with velvet<br> hassocks before them for the girls. Far across the long room<br> before the hearth, the seven-foot sofa, Ashley's favorite seat,<br> reared its high back, like some huge sleeping animal.<br><br> She closed the door except for a crack and tried to make her heart<br> beat more slowly. She tried to remember just exactly what she had<br> planned last night to say to Ashley, but she couldn't recall<br> anything. Had she thought up something and forgotten it--or had<br> she only planned that Ashley should say something to her? She<br> couldn't remember, and a sudden cold fright fell upon her. If her<br> heart would only stop pounding in her ears, perhaps she could<br> think of what to say. But the quick thudding only increased as<br> she heard him call a final farewell and walk into the front hall.<br><br> All she could think of was that she loved him--everything about<br> him, from the proud lift of his gold head to his slender dark<br> boots, loved his laughter even when it mystified her, loved his<br> bewildering silences. Oh, if only he would walk in on her now and<br> take her in his arms, so she would be spared the need of saying<br> anything. He must love her--’Perhaps if I prayed--’ She squeezed<br> her eyes tightly and began gabbling to herself ‘Hail Mary, full of<br> grace--’<br><br> ‘Why, Scarlett!’ said Ashley's voice, breaking in through the<br> roaring in her ears and throwing her into utter confusion. He<br> stood in the hall peering at her through the partly opened door,<br> a quizzical smile on his face.<br><br> ‘Who are you hiding from--Charles or the Tarletons?’<br><br> She gulped. So he had noticed how the men had swarmed about her!<br> How unutterably dear he was standing there with his eyes<br> twinkling, all unaware of her excitement. She could not speak,<br> but she put out a hand and drew him into the room. He entered,<br> puzzled but interested. There was a tenseness about her, a glow<br> in her eyes that he had never seen before, and even in the dim<br> light he could see the rosy flush on her cheeks. Automatically he<br> closed the door behind him and took her hand.<br><br> ‘What is it?’ he said, almost in a whisper.<br><br> At the touch of his hand, she began to tremble. It was going to<br> happen now, just as she had dreamed it. A thousand incoherent<br> thoughts shot through her mind, and she could not catch a single<br> one to mold into a word. She could only shake and look up into<br> his face. Why didn't he speak?<br><br> ‘What is it?’ he repeated. ‘A secret to tell me?’<br><br> Suddenly she found her tongue and just as suddenly all the years<br> of Ellen's teachings fell away, and the forthright Irish blood of<br> Gerald spoke from his daughter's lips.<br><br> ‘Yes--a secret. I love you.’<br><br> For an instance there was a silence so acute it seemed that<br> neither of them even breathed. Then the trembling fell away from<br> her, as happiness and pride surged through her. Why hadn't she<br> done this before? How much simpler than all the ladylike<br> maneuverings she had been taught. And then her eyes sought his.<br><br> There was a look of consternation in them, of incredulity and<br> something more--what was it? Yes, Gerald had looked that way the<br> day his pet hunter had broken his leg and he had had to shoot him.<br> Why did she have to think of that now? Such a silly thought. And<br> why did Ashley look so oddly and say nothing? Then something like<br> a well-trained mask came down over his face and he smiled<br> gallantly.<br><br> ‘Isn't it enough that you've collected every other man's heart<br> here today?’ he said, with the old, teasing, caressing note in his<br> voice. ‘Do you want to make it unanimous? Well, you've always<br> had my heart, you know. You cut your teeth on it.’<br><br> Something was wrong--all wrong! This was not the way she had<br> planned it. Through the mad tearing of ideas round and round in<br> her brain, one was beginning to take form. Somehow--for some<br> reason--Ashley was acting as if he thought she was just flirting<br> with him. But he knew differently. She knew he did.<br><br> ‘Ashley--Ashley--tell me--you must--oh, don't tease me now! Have<br> I your heart? Oh, my dear, I lo--’<br><br> His hand went across her lips, swiftly. The mask was gone.<br><br> ‘You must not say these things, Scarlett! You mustn't. You don't<br> mean them. You'll hate yourself for saying them, and you'll hate<br> me for hearing them!’<br><br> She jerked her head away. A hot swift current was running through<br> her.<br><br> ‘I couldn't ever hate you. I tell you I love you and I know you<br> must care about me because--’ She stopped. Never before had she<br> seen so much misery in anyone's face. ‘Ashley, do you care--you<br> do, don't you?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ he said dully. ‘I care.’<br><br> If he had said he loathed her, she could not have been more<br> frightened. She plucked at his sleeve, speechless.<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ he said, ‘can't we go away and forget that we have<br> ever said these things?’<br><br> ‘No,’ she whispered. ‘I can't. What do you mean? Don't you want<br> to--to marry me?’<br><br> He replied, ‘I'm going to marry Melanie.’<br><br> Somehow she found that she was sitting on the low velvet chair and<br> Ashley, on the hassock at her feet, was holding both her hands in<br> his, in a hard grip. He was saying things--things that made no<br> sense. Her mind was quite blank, quite empty of all the thoughts<br> that had surged through it only a moment before, and his words<br> made no more impression than rain on glass. They fell on<br> unhearing ears, words that were swift and tender and full of pity,<br> like a father speaking to a hurt child.<br><br> The sound of Melanie's name caught in her consciousness and she<br> looked into his crystal-gray eyes. She saw in them the old<br> remoteness that had always baffled her--and a look of self-hatred.<br><br> ‘Father is to announce the engagement tonight. We are to be<br> married soon. I should have told you, but I thought you knew. I<br> thought everyone knew--had known for years. I never dreamed that<br> you-- You've so many beaux. I thought Stuart--’<br><br> Life and feeling and comprehension were beginning to flow back<br> into her.<br><br> ‘But you just said you cared for me.’<br><br> His warm hands hurt hers.<br><br> ‘My dear, must you make me say things that will hurt you?’<br><br> Her silence pressed him on.<br><br> ‘How can I make you see these things, my dear. You who are so<br> young and unthinking that you do not know what marriage means.’<br><br> ‘I know I love you.’<br><br> ‘Love isn't enough to make a successful marriage when two people<br> are as different as we are. You would want all of a man,<br> Scarlett, his body, his heart, his soul, his thoughts. And if you<br> did not have them, you would be miserable. And I couldn't give<br> you all of me. I couldn't give all of me to anyone. And I would<br> not want all of your mind and your soul. And you would be hurt,<br> and then you would come to hate me--how bitterly! You would hate<br> the books I read and the music I loved, because they took me away<br> from you even for a moment. And I--perhaps I--’<br><br> ‘Do you love her?’<br><br> ‘She is like me, part of my blood, and we understand each other.<br> Scarlett! Scarlett! Can't I make you see that a marriage can't<br> go on in any sort of peace unless the two people are alike?’<br><br> Some one else had said that: ‘Like must marry like or there'll be<br> no happiness.’ Who was it? It seemed a million years since she<br> had heard that, but it still did not make sense.<br><br> ‘But you said you cared.’<br><br> ‘I shouldn't have said it.’<br><br> Somewhere in her brain, a slow fire rose and rage began to blot<br> out everything else.<br><br> ‘Well, having been cad enough to say it--’<br><br> His face went white.<br><br> ‘I was a cad to say it, as I'm going to marry Melanie. I did you<br> a wrong and Melanie a greater one. I should not have said it, for<br> I knew you wouldn't understand. How could I help caring for you--<br> you who have all the passion for life that I have not? You who<br> can love and hate with a violence impossible to me? Why you are<br> as elemental as fire and wind and wild things and I--’<br><br> She thought of Melanie and saw suddenly her quiet brown eyes with<br> their far-off look, her placid little hands in their black lace<br> mitts, her gentle silences. And then her rage broke, the same<br> rage that drove Gerald to murder and other Irish ancestors to<br> misdeeds that cost them their necks. There was nothing in her now<br> of the well-bred Robillards who could bear with white silence<br> anything the world might cast.<br><br> ‘Why don't you say it, you coward! You're afraid to marry me!<br> You'd rather live with that stupid little fool who can't open her<br> mouth except to say 'Yes' or 'No' and raise a passel of mealy-<br> mouthed brats just like her! Why--’<br><br> ‘You must not say these things about Melanie!’<br><br> ‘'I mustn't' be damned to you! Who are you to tell me I mustn't?<br> You coward, you cad, you-- You made me believe you were going to<br> marry me--’<br><br> ‘Be fair,’ his voice pleaded. ‘Did I ever--’<br><br> She did not want to be fair, although she knew what he said was<br> true. He had never once crossed the borders of friendliness with<br> her and, when she thought of this fresh anger rose, the anger of<br> hurt pride and feminine vanity. She had run after him and he<br> would have none of her. He preferred a whey-faced little fool<br> like Melanie to her. Oh, far better that she had followed Ellen<br> and Mammy's precepts and never, never revealed that she even liked<br> him--better anything than to be faced with this scorching shame!<br><br> She sprang to her feet, her hands clenched and he rose towering<br> over her, his face full of the mute misery of one forced to face<br> realities when realities are agonies.<br><br> ‘I shall hate you till I die, you cad--you lowdown--lowdown--’<br> What was the word she wanted? She could not think of any word bad<br> enough.<br><br> ‘Scarlett--please--’<br><br> He put out his hand toward her and, as he did, she slapped him<br> across the face with all the strength she had. The noise cracked<br> like a whip in the still room and suddenly her rage was gone, and<br> there was desolation in her heart.<br><br> The red mark of her hand showed plainly on his white tired face.<br> He said nothing but lifted her limp hand to his lips and kissed<br> it. Then he was gone before she could speak again, closing the<br> door softly behind him.<br><br> She sat down again very suddenly, the reaction from her rage<br> making her knees feel weak. He was gone and the memory of his<br> stricken face would haunt her till she died.<br><br> She heard the soft muffled sound of his footsteps dying away down<br> the long hall, and the complete enormity of her actions came over<br> her. She had lost him forever. Now he would hate her and every<br> time he looked at her he would remember how she threw herself at<br> him when he had given her no encouragement at all.<br><br> ‘I'm as bad as Honey Wilkes,’ she thought suddenly, and remembered<br> how everyone, and she more than anyone else, had laughed<br> contemptuously at Honey's forward conduct. She saw Honey's<br> awkward wigglings and heard her silly titters as she hung onto<br> boys' arms, and the thought stung her to new rage, rage at<br> herself, at Ashley, at the world. Because she hated herself, she<br> hated them all with the fury of the thwarted and humiliated love<br> of sixteen. Only a little true tenderness had been mixed into her<br> love. Mostly it had been compounded out of vanity and complacent<br> confidence in her own charms. Now she had lost and, greater than<br> her sense of loss, was the fear that she had made a public<br> spectacle of herself. Had she been as obvious as Honey? Was<br> everyone laughing at her? She began to shake at the thought.<br><br> Her hand dropped to a little table beside her, fingering a tiny<br> china rose-bowl on which two china cherubs smirked. The room was<br> so still she almost screamed to break the silence. She must do<br> something or go mad. She picked up the bowl and hurled it<br> viciously across the room toward the fireplace. It barely cleared<br> the tall back of the sofa and splintered with a little crash<br> against the marble mantelpiece.<br><br> ‘This,’ said a voice from the depths of the sofa, ‘is too much.’<br><br> Nothing had ever startled or frightened her so much, and her mouth<br> went too dry for her to utter a sound. She caught hold of the<br> back of the chair, her knees going weak under her, as Rhett Butler<br> rose from the sofa where he had been lying and made her a bow of<br> exaggerated politeness.<br><br> ‘It is bad enough to have an afternoon nap disturbed by such a<br> passage as I've been forced to hear, but why should my life be<br> endangered?’<br><br> He was real. He wasn't a ghost. But, saints preserve us, he had<br> heard everything! She rallied her forces into a semblance of<br> dignity.<br><br> ‘Sir, you should have made known your presence.’<br><br> ‘Indeed?’ His white teeth gleamed and his bold dark eyes laughed<br> at her. ‘But you were the intruder. I was forced to wait for Mr.<br> Kennedy, and feeling that I was perhaps persona non grata in the<br> back yard, I was thoughtful enough to remove my unwelcome presence<br> here where I thought I would be undisturbed. But, alas!’ he<br> shrugged and laughed softly.<br><br> Her temper was beginning to rise again at the thought that this<br> rude and impertinent man had heard everything--heard things she<br> now wished she had died before she ever uttered.<br><br> ‘Eavesdroppers--’ she began furiously.<br><br> ‘Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive<br> things,’ he grinned. ‘From a long experience in eavesdropping, I--’<br><br> ‘Sir,’ she said, ‘you are no gentleman!’<br><br> ‘An apt observation,’ he answered airily. ‘And, you, Miss, are no<br> lady.’ He seemed to find her very amusing, for he laughed softly<br> again. ‘No one can remain a lady after saying and doing what I<br> have just overheard. However, ladies have seldom held any charms<br> for me. I know what they are thinking, but they never have the<br> courage or lack of breeding to say what they think. And that, in<br> time, becomes a bore. But you, my dear Miss O'Hara, are a girl of<br> rare spirit, very admirable spirit, and I take off my hat to you.<br> I fail to understand what charms the elegant Mr. Wilkes can hold<br> for a girl of your tempestuous nature. He should thank God on<br> bended knee for a girl with your--how did he put it?--'passion for<br> living,' but being a poor-spirited wretch--’<br><br> ‘You aren't fit to wipe his boots!’ she shouted in rage.<br><br> ‘And you were going to hate him all your life!’ He sank down on<br> the sofa and she heard him laughing.<br><br> If she could have killed him, she would have done it. Instead,<br> she walked out of the room with such dignity as she could summon<br> and banged the heavy door behind her.<br><br> <br><br> She went up the stairs so swiftly that when she reached the<br> landing, she thought she was going to faint. She stopped,<br> clutching the banisters, her heart hammering so hard from anger,<br> insult and exertion that it seemed about to burst through her<br> basque. She tried to draw deep breaths but Mammy's lacings were<br> too tight. If she should faint and they should find her here on<br> the landing, what would they think? Oh, they'd think everything.<br> Ashley and that vile Butler man and those nasty girls who were so<br> jealous! For once in her life, she wished that she carried<br> smelling salts, like the other girls, but she had never even owned<br> a vinaigrette. She had always been so proud of never feeling<br> giddy. She simply could not let herself faint now!<br><br> Gradually the sickening feeling began to depart. In a minute,<br> she'd feel all right and then she'd slip quietly into the little<br> dressing room adjoining India's room, unloose her stays and creep<br> in and lay herself on one of the beds beside the sleeping girls.<br> She tried to quiet her heart and fix her face into more composed<br> lines, for she knew she must look like a crazy woman. If any of<br> the girls were awake, they'd know something was wrong. And no one<br> must ever, ever know that anything had happened.<br><br> Through the wide bay window on the lawn she could see the men<br> still lounging in their chairs under the trees and in the shade of<br> the arbor. How she envied them! How wonderful to be a man and<br> never have to undergo miseries such as she had just passed<br> through. As she stood watching them, hot eyed and dizzy, she<br> heard the rapid pounding of a horse's hooves on the front drive,<br> the scattering of gravel and the sound of an excited voice calling<br> a question to one of the negroes. The gravel flew again and<br> across her vision a man on horseback galloped over the green lawn<br> toward the lazy group under the trees.<br><br> Some late-come guest, but why did he ride his horse across the<br> turf that was India's pride? She could not recognize him, but as<br> he flung himself from the saddle and clutched John Wilkes' arm,<br> she could see that there was excitement in every line of him. The<br> crowd swarmed about him, tall glasses and palmetto fans abandoned<br> on tables and on the ground. In spite of the distance, she could<br> hear the hubbub of voices, questioning, calling, feel the fever-<br> pitch tenseness of the men. Then above the confused sounds Stuart<br> Tarleton's voice rose, in an exultant shout ‘Yee-aay-ee!’ as if he<br> were on the hunting field. And she heard for the first time,<br> without knowing it, the Rebel yell.<br><br> As she watched, the four Tarletons followed by the Fontaine boys<br> broke from the group and began hurrying toward the stable, yelling<br> as they ran, ‘Jeems! You, Jeems! Saddle the horses!’<br><br> ‘Somebody's house must have caught fire,’ Scarlett thought. But<br> fire or no fire, her job was to get herself back into the bedroom<br> before she was discovered.<br><br> Her heart was quieter now and she tiptoed up the steps into the<br> silent hall. A heavy warm somnolence lay over the house, as if it<br> slept at ease like the girls, until night when it would burst into<br> its full beauty with music and candle flames. Carefully, she<br> eased open the door of the dressing room and slipped in. Her hand<br> was behind her, still holding the knob, when Honey Wilkes' voice,<br> low pitched, almost in a whisper, came to her through the crack of<br> the opposite door leading into the bedroom.<br><br> ‘I think Scarlett acted as fast as a girl could act today.’<br><br> Scarlett felt her heart begin its mad racing again and she<br> clutched her hand against it unconsciously, as if she would<br> squeeze it into submission. ‘Eavesdroppers often hear highly<br> instructive things,’ jibed a memory. Should she slip out again?<br> Or make herself known and embarrass Honey as she deserved? But<br> the next voice made her pause. A team of mules could not have<br> dragged her away when she heard Melanie's voice.<br><br> ‘Oh, Honey, no! Don't be unkind. She's just high spirited and<br> vivacious. I thought her most charming.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ thought Scarlett, clawing her nails into her basque. ‘To<br> have that mealymouthed little mess take up for me!’<br><br> It was harder to bear than Honey's out-and-out cattiness.<br> Scarlett had never trusted any woman and had never credited any<br> woman except her mother with motives other than selfish ones.<br> Melanie knew she had Ashley securely, so she could well afford to<br> show such a Christian spirit. Scarlett felt it was just Melanie's<br> way of parading her conquest and getting credit for being sweet at<br> the same time. Scarlett had frequently used the same trick<br> herself when discussing other girls with men, and it had never<br> failed to convince foolish males of her sweetness and<br> unselfishness.<br><br> ‘Well, Miss,’ said Honey tartly, her voice rising, ‘you must be<br> blind.’<br><br> ‘Hush, Honey,’ hissed the voice of Sally Munroe. ‘They'll hear<br> you all over the house!’<br><br> Honey lowered her voice but went on.<br><br> ‘Well, you saw how she was carrying on with every man she could<br> get hold of--even Mr. Kennedy and he's her own sister's beau. I<br> never saw the like! And she certainly was going after Charles.’<br> Honey giggled self-consciously. ‘And you know, Charles and I--’<br><br> ‘Are you really?’ whispered voices excitedly.<br><br> ‘Well, don't tell anybody, girls--not yet!’<br><br> There were more gigglings and the bed springs creaked as someone<br> squeezed Honey. Melanie murmured something about how happy she<br> was that Honey would be her sister.<br><br> ‘Well, I won't be happy to have Scarlett for my sister, because<br> she's a fast piece if ever I saw one,’ came the aggrieved voice of<br> Hefty Tarleton. ‘But she's as good as engaged to Stuart. Brent<br> says she doesn't give a rap about him, but, of course, Brent's<br> crazy about her, too.’<br><br> ‘If you should ask me,’ said Honey with mysterious importance,<br> ‘there's only one person she does give a rap about. And that's<br> Ashley!’<br><br> As the whisperings merged together violently, questioning,<br> interrupting, Scarlett felt herself go cold with fear and<br> humiliation. Honey was a fool, a silly, a simpleton about men,<br> but she had a feminine instinct about other women that Scarlett<br> had underestimated. The mortification and hurt pride that she had<br> suffered in the library with Ashley and with Rhett Butler were pin<br> pricks to this. Men could be trusted to keep their mouths shut,<br> even men like Mr. Butler, but with Honey Wilkes giving tongue like<br> a hound in the field, the entire County would know about it before<br> six o'clock. And Gerald had said only last night that he wouldn't<br> be having the County laughing at his daughter. And how they would<br> all laugh now! Clammy perspiration, starting under her armpits,<br> began to creep down her ribs.<br><br> Melanie's voice, measured and peaceful, a little reproving, rose<br> above the others.<br><br> ‘Honey, you know that isn't so. And it's so unkind.’<br><br> ‘It is too, Melly, and if you weren't always so busy looking for<br> the good in people that haven't got any good in them, you'd see<br> it. And I'm glad it's so. It serves her right. All Scarlett<br> O'Hara has ever done has been to stir up trouble and try to get<br> other girls' beaux. You know mighty well she took Stuart from<br> India and she didn't want him. And today she tried to take Mr.<br> Kennedy and Ashley and Charles--’<br><br> ‘I must get home!’ thought Scarlett. ‘I must get home!’<br><br> If she could only be transferred by magic to Tara and to safety.<br> If she could only be with Ellen, just to see her, to hold onto her<br> skirt, to cry and pour out the whole story in her lap. If she had<br> to listen to another word, she'd rush in and pull out Honey's<br> straggly pale hair in big handfuls and spit on Melanie Hamilton to<br> show her just what she thought of her charity. But she'd already<br> acted common enough today, enough like white trash--that was where<br> all her trouble lay.<br><br> She pressed her hands hard against her skirts, so they would not<br> rustle and backed out as stealthily as an animal. Home, she<br> thought, as she sped down the hall, past the closed doors and<br> still rooms, I must go home.<br><br> She was already on the front porch when a new thought brought her<br> up sharply--she couldn't go home! She couldn't run away! She<br> would have to see it through, bear all the malice of the girls and<br> her own humiliation and heartbreak. To run away would only give<br> them more ammunition.<br><br> She pounded her clenched fist against the tall white pillar beside<br> her, and she wished that she were Samson, so that she could pull<br> down all of Twelve Oaks and destroy every person in it. She'd<br> make them sorry. She'd show them. She didn't quite see how she'd<br> show them, but she'd do it all the same. She'd hurt them worse<br> than they hurt her.<br><br> For the moment, Ashley as Ashley was forgotten. He was not the<br> tall drowsy boy she loved but part and parcel of the Wilkeses,<br> Twelve Oaks, the County--and she hated them all because they<br> laughed. Vanity was stronger than love at sixteen and there was<br> no room in her hot heart now for anything but hate.<br><br> ‘I won't go home,’ she thought. ‘I'll stay here and I'll make<br> them sorry. And I'll never tell Mother. No, I'll never tell<br> anybody.’ She braced herself to go back into the house, to<br> reclimb the stairs and go into another bedroom.<br><br> As she turned, she saw Charles coming into the house from the<br> other end of the long hall. When he saw her, he hurried toward<br> her. His hair was tousled and his face near geranium with<br> excitement.<br><br> ‘Do you know what's happened?’ he cried, even before he reached<br> her. ‘Have you heard? Paul Wilson just rode over from Jonesboro<br> with the news!’<br><br> He paused, breathless, as he came up to her. She said nothing and<br> only stared at him.<br><br> ‘Mr. Lincoln has called for men, soldiers--I mean volunteers--<br> seventy-five thousand of them!’<br><br> Mr. Lincoln again! Didn't men ever think about anything that<br> really mattered? Here was this fool expecting her to be excited<br> about Mr. Lincoln's didoes when her heart was broken and her<br> reputation as good as ruined.<br><br> Charles stared at her. Her face was paper white and her narrow<br> eyes blazing like emeralds. He had never seen such fire in any<br> girl's face, such a glow in anyone's eyes.<br><br> ‘I'm so clumsy,’ he said. ‘I should have told you more gently. I<br> forgot how delicate ladies are. I'm sorry I've upset you so. You<br> don't feel faint, do you? Can I get you a glass of water?’<br><br> ‘No,’ she said, and managed a crooked smile.<br><br> ‘Shall we go sit on the bench?’ he asked, taking her arm.<br><br> She nodded and he carefully handed her down the front steps and<br> led her across the grass to the iron bench beneath the largest oak<br> in the front yard. How fragile and tender women are, he thought,<br> the mere mention of war and harshness makes them faint. The idea<br> made him feel very masculine and he was doubly gentle as he seated<br> her. She looked so strangely, and there was a wild beauty about<br> her white face that set his heart leaping. Could it be that she<br> was distressed by the thought that he might go to the war? No,<br> that was too conceited for belief. But why did she look at him so<br> oddly? And why did her hands shake as they fingered her lace<br> handkerchief. And her thick sooty lashes--they were fluttering<br> just like the eyes of girls in romances he had read, fluttering<br> with timidity and love.<br><br> He cleared his throat three times to speak and failed each time.<br> He dropped his eyes because her own green ones met his so<br> piercingly, almost as if she were not seeing him.<br><br> ‘He has a lot of money,’ she was thinking swiftly, as a thought<br> and a plan went through her brain. ‘And he hasn't any parents to<br> bother me and he lives in Atlanta. And if I married him right<br> away, it would show Ashley that I didn't care a rap--that I was<br> only flirting with him. And it would just kill Honey. She'd<br> never, never catch another beau and everybody'd laugh fit to die<br> at her. And it would hurt Melanie, because she loves Charles so<br> much. And it would hurt Stu and Brent--’ She didn't quite know<br> why she wanted to hurt them, except that they had catty sisters.<br> ‘And they'd all be sorry when I came back here to visit in a fine<br> carriage and with lots of pretty clothes and a house of my own.<br> And they would never, never laugh at me.’<br><br> ‘Of course, it will mean fighting,’ said Charles, after several<br> more embarrassed attempts. ‘But don't you fret, Miss Scarlett,<br> it'll be over in a month and we'll have them howling. Yes, sir!<br> Howling! I wouldn't miss it for anything. I'm afraid there won't<br> be much of a ball tonight, because the Troop is going to meet at<br> Jonesboro. The Tarleton boys have gone to spread the news. I<br> know the ladies will be sorry.’<br><br> She said, ‘Oh,’ for want of anything better, but it sufficed.<br><br> Coolness was beginning to come back to her and her mind was<br> collecting itself. A frost lay over all her emotions and she<br> thought that she would never feel anything warmly again. Why not<br> take this pretty, flushed boy? He was as good as anyone else and<br> she didn't care. No, she could never care about anything again,<br> not if she lived to be ninety.<br><br> ‘I can't decide now whether to go with Mr. Wade Hampton's South<br> Carolina Legion or with the Atlanta Gate City Guard.’<br><br> She said, ‘Oh,’ again and their eyes met and the fluttering lashes<br> were his undoing.<br><br> ‘Will you wait for me, Miss Scarlett? It--it would be Heaven just<br> knowing that you were waiting for me until after we licked them!’<br> He hung breathless on her words, watching the way her lips curled<br> up at the corners, noting for the first time the shadows about<br> these corners and thinking what it would mean to kiss them. Her<br> hand, with palm clammy with perspiration, slid into his.<br><br> ‘I wouldn't want to wait,’ she said and her eyes were veiled.<br><br> He sat clutching her hand, his mouth wide open. Watching him from<br> under her lashes, Scarlett thought detachedly that he looked like<br> a gigged frog. He stuttered several times, closed his mouth and<br> opened it again, and again became geranium colored.<br><br> ‘Can you possibly love me?’<br><br> She said nothing but looked down into her lap, and Charles was<br> thrown into new states of ecstasy and embarrassment. Perhaps a<br> man should not ask a girl such a question. Perhaps it would be<br> unmaidenly for her to answer it. Having never possessed the<br> courage to get himself into such a situation before, Charles was<br> at a loss as to how to act. He wanted to shout and to sing and to<br> kiss her and to caper about the lawn and then run tell everyone,<br> black and white, that she loved him. But he only squeezed her<br> hand until he drove her rings into the flesh.<br><br> ‘You will marry me soon, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘Um,’ she said, fingering a fold of her dress.<br><br> ‘Shall we make it a double wedding with Mel--’<br><br> ‘No,’ she said quickly, her eyes glinting up at him ominously.<br> Charles knew again that he had made an error. Of course, a girl<br> wanted her own wedding--not shared glory. How kind she was to<br> overlook his blunderings. If it were only dark and he had the<br> courage of shadows and could kiss her hand and say the things he<br> longed to say.<br><br> ‘When may I speak to your father?’<br><br> ‘The sooner the better,’ she said, hoping that perhaps he would<br> release the crushing pressure on her rings before she had to ask<br> him to do it.<br><br> He leaped up and for a moment she thought he was going to cut a<br> caper, before dignity claimed him. He looked down at her<br> radiantly, his whole clean simple heart in his eyes. She had<br> never had anyone look at her thus before and would never have it<br> from any other man, but in her queer detachment she only thought<br> that he looked like a calf.<br><br> ‘I'll go now and find your father,’ he said, smiling all over his<br> face. ‘I can't wait. Will you excuse me--dear?’ The endearment<br> came hard but having said it once, he repeated it again with<br> pleasure.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ she said. ‘I'll wait here. It's so cool and nice here.’<br><br> He went off across the lawn and disappeared around the house, and<br> she was alone under the rustling oak. From the stables, men were<br> streaming out on horseback, negro servants riding hard behind<br> their masters. The Munroe boys tore past waving their hats, and<br> the Fontaines and Calverts went down the road yelling. The four<br> Tarletons charged across the lawn by her and Brent shouted:<br> ‘Mother's going to give us the horses! Yee-aay-ee!’ Turf flew<br> and they were gone, leaving her alone again.<br><br> The white house reared its tall columns before her, seeming to<br> withdraw with dignified aloofness from her. It would never be her<br> house now. Ashley would never carry her over the threshold as his<br> bride. Oh, Ashley, Ashley! What have I done? Deep in her, under<br> layers of hurt pride and cold practicality, something stirred<br> hurtingly. An adult emotion was being born, stronger than her<br> vanity or her willful selfishness. She loved Ashley and she knew<br> she loved him and she had never cared so much as in that instant<br> when she saw Charles disappearing around the curved graveled walk.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER VII<br><br> <br> Within two weeks Scarlett had become a wife, and within two months<br> more she was a widow. She was soon released from the bonds she<br> had assumed with so much haste and so little thought, but she was<br> never again to know the careless freedom of her unmarried days.<br> Widowhood had crowded closely on the heels of marriage but, to her<br> dismay, motherhood soon followed.<br><br> In after years when she thought of those last days of April, 1861,<br> Scarlett could never quite remember details. Time and events were<br> telescoped, jumbled together like a nightmare that had no reality<br> or reason. Till the day she died there would be blank spots in<br> her memories of those days. Especially vague were her recollections<br> of the time between her acceptance of Charles and her wedding. Two<br> weeks! So short an engagement would have been impossible in times<br> of peace. Then there would have been a decorous interval of a year<br> or at least six months. But the South was aflame with war, events<br> roared along as swiftly as if carried by a mighty wind and the slow<br> tempo of the old days was gone. Ellen had wrung her hands and<br> counseled delay, in order that Scarlett might think the matter over<br> at greater length. But to her pleadings, Scarlett turned a sullen<br> face and a deaf ear. Marry she would! and quickly too. Within two<br> weeks.<br><br> Learning that Ashley's wedding had been moved up from the autumn<br> to the first of May, so he could leave with the Troop as soon as<br> it was called into service, Scarlett set the date of her wedding<br> for the day before his. Ellen protested but Charles pleaded with<br> new-found eloquence, for he was impatient to be off to South<br> Carolina to join Wade Hampton's Legion, and Gerald sided with the<br> two young people. He was excited by the war fever and pleased<br> that Scarlett had made so good a match, and who was he to stand in<br> the way of young love when there was a war? Ellen, distracted,<br> finally gave in as other mothers throughout the South were doing.<br> Their leisured world had been turned topsy-turvy, and their<br> pleadings, prayers and advice availed nothing against the powerful<br> forces sweeping them along.<br><br> The South was intoxicated with enthusiasm and excitement.<br> Everyone knew that one battle would end the war and every young<br> man hastened to enlist before the war should end--hastened to<br> marry his sweetheart before he rushed off to Virginia to strike a<br> blow at the Yankees. There were dozens of war weddings in the<br> County and there was little time for the sorrow of parting, for<br> everyone was too busy and excited for either solemn thoughts or<br> tears. The ladies were making uniforms, knitting socks and<br> rolling bandages, and the men were drilling and shooting. Train<br> loads of troops passed through Jonesboro daily on their way north<br> to Atlanta and Virginia. Some detachments were gaily uniformed in<br> the scarlets and light blues and greens of select social-militia<br> companies; some small groups were in homespun and coonskin caps;<br> others, ununiformed, were in broadcloth and fine linen; all were<br> half-drilled, half-armed, wild with excitement and shouting as<br> though en route to a picnic. The sight of these men threw the<br> County boys into a panic for fear the war would be over before<br> they could reach Virginia, and preparations for the Troop's<br> departure were speeded.<br><br> In the midst of this turmoil, preparations went forward for<br> Scarlett's wedding and, almost before she knew it, she was clad in<br> Ellen's wedding dress and veil, coming down the wide stairs of<br> Tara on her father's arm, to face a house packed full with guests.<br> Afterward she remembered, as from a dream, the hundreds of candles<br> flaring on the walls, her mother's face, loving, a little<br> bewildered, her lips moving in a silent prayer for her daughter's<br> happiness, Gerald flushed with brandy and pride that his daughter<br> was marrying both money, a fine name and an old one--and Ashley,<br> standing at the bottom of the steps with Melanie's arm through<br> his.<br><br> When she saw the look on his face, she thought: ‘This can't be<br> real. It can't be. It's a nightmare. I'll wake up and find it's<br> all been a nightmare. I mustn't think of it now, or I'll begin<br> screaming in front of all these people. I can't think now. I'll<br> think later, when I can stand it--when I can't see his eyes.’<br><br> It was all very dreamlike, the passage through the aisle of<br> smiling people, Charles' scarlet face and stammering voice and her<br> own replies, so startlingly clear, so cold. And the congratulations<br> afterward and the kissing and the toasts and the dancing--all, all<br> like a dream. Even the feel of Ashley's kiss upon her cheek, even<br> Melanie's soft whisper, ‘Now, we're really and truly sisters,’ were<br> unreal. Even the excitement caused by the swooning spell that<br> overtook Charles' plump emotional aunt, Miss Pittypat Hamilton, had<br> the quality of a nightmare.<br><br> But when the dancing and toasting were finally ended and the dawn<br> was coming, when all the Atlanta guests who could be crowded into<br> Tara and the overseer's house had gone to sleep on beds, sofas and<br> pallets on the floor and all the neighbors had gone home to rest<br> in preparation for the wedding at Twelve Oaks the next day, then<br> the dreamlike trance shattered like crystal before reality. The<br> reality was the blushing Charles, emerging from her dressing room<br> in his nightshirt, avoiding the startled look she gave him over<br> the high-pulled sheet.<br><br> Of course, she knew that married people occupied the same bed but<br> she had never given the matter a thought before. It seemed very<br> natural in the case of her mother and father, but she had never<br> applied it to herself. Now for the first time since the barbecue<br> she realized just what she had brought on herself. The thought of<br> this strange boy whom she hadn't really wanted to marry getting<br> into bed with her, when her heart was breaking with an agony of<br> regret at her hasty action and the anguish of losing Ashley<br> forever, was too much to be borne. As he hesitatingly approached<br> the bed she spoke in a hoarse whisper.<br><br> ‘I'll scream out loud if you come near me. I will! I will--at<br> the top of my voice! Get away from me! Don't you dare touch me!’<br><br> So Charles Hamilton spent his wedding night in an armchair in the<br> corner, not too unhappily, for he understood, or thought he<br> understood, the modesty and delicacy of his bride. He was willing<br> to wait until her fears subsided, only--only-- He sighed as he<br> twisted about seeking a comfortable position, for he was going<br> away to the war so very soon.<br><br> Nightmarish as her own wedding had been, Ashley's wedding was even<br> worse. Scarlett stood in her apple-green ‘second-day’ dress in<br> the parlor of Twelve Oaks amid the blaze of hundreds of candles,<br> jostled by the same throng as the night before, and saw the plain<br> little face of Melanie Hamilton glow into beauty as she became<br> Melanie Wilkes. Now, Ashley was gone forever. Her Ashley. No,<br> not her Ashley now. Had he ever been hers? It was all so mixed<br> up in her mind and her mind was so tired, so bewildered. He had<br> said he loved her, but what was it that had separated them? If<br> she could only remember. She had stilled the County's gossiping<br> tongue by marrying Charles, but what did that matter now? It had<br> seemed so important once, but now it didn't seem important at all.<br> All that mattered was Ashley. Now he was gone and she was married<br> to a man she not only did not love but for whom she had an active<br> contempt.<br><br> Oh, how she regretted it all. She had often heard of people<br> cutting off their noses to spite their faces but heretofore it had<br> been only a figure of speech. Now she knew just what it meant.<br> And mingled with her frenzied desire to be free of Charles and<br> safely back at Tara, an unmarried girl again, ran the knowledge<br> that she had only herself to blame. Ellen had tried to stop her<br> and she would not listen.<br><br> So she danced through the night of Ashley's wedding in a daze and<br> said things mechanically and smiled and irrelevantly wondered at<br> the stupidity of people who thought her a happy bride and could<br> not see that her heart was broken. Well, thank God, they couldn't<br> see!<br><br> That night after Mammy had helped her undress and had departed and<br> Charles had emerged shyly from the dressing room, wondering if he<br> was to spend a second night in the horsehair chair, she burst into<br> tears. She cried until Charles climbed into bed beside her and<br> tried to comfort her, cried without words until no more tears<br> would come and at last she lay sobbing quietly on his shoulder.<br><br> If there had not been a war, there would have been a week of<br> visiting about the County, with balls and barbecues in honor of<br> the two newly married couples before they set off to Saratoga or<br> White Sulphur for wedding trips. If there had not been a war,<br> Scarlett would have had third-day and fourth-day and fifth-day<br> dresses to wear to the Fontaine and Calvert and Tarleton parties<br> in her honor. But there were no parties now and no wedding trips.<br> A week after the wedding Charles left to join Colonel Wade<br> Hampton, and two weeks later Ashley and the Troop departed,<br> leaving the whole County bereft.<br><br> In those two weeks, Scarlett never saw Ashley alone, never had a<br> private word with him. Not even at the terrible moment of<br> parting, when he stopped by Tara on his way to the train, did she<br> have a private talk. Melanie, bonneted and shawled, sedate in<br> newly acquired matronly dignity, hung on his arm and the entire<br> personnel of Tara, black and white, turned out to see Ashley off<br> to the war.<br><br> Melanie said: ‘You must kiss Scarlett, Ashley. She's my sister<br> now,’ and Ashley bent and touched her cheek with cold lips, his<br> face drawn and taut. Scarlett could hardly take any joy from that<br> kiss, so sullen was her heart at Melly's prompting it. Melanie<br> smothered her with an embrace at parting.<br><br> ‘You will come to Atlanta and visit me and Aunt Pittypat, won't<br> you? Oh, darling, we want to have you so much! We want to know<br> Charlie's wife better.’<br><br> Five weeks passed during which letters, shy, ecstatic, loving,<br> came from Charles in South Carolina telling of his love, his plans<br> for the future when the war was over, his desire to become a hero<br> for her sake and his worship of his commander, Wade Hampton. In<br> the seventh week, there came a telegram from Colonel Hampton<br> himself, and then a letter, a kind, dignified letter of condolence.<br> Charles was dead. The colonel would have wired earlier, but<br> Charles, thinking his illness a trifling one, did not wish to have<br> his family worried. The unfortunate boy had not only been cheated<br> of the love he thought he had won but also of his high hopes of<br> honor and glory on the field of battle. He had died ignominiously<br> and swiftly of pneumonia, following measles, without ever having<br> gotten any closer to the Yankees than the camp in South Carolina.<br><br> In due time, Charles' son was born and, because it was fashionable<br> to name boys after their fathers' commanding officers, he was<br> called Wade Hampton Hamilton. Scarlett had wept with despair at<br> the knowledge that she was pregnant and wished that she were dead.<br> But she carried the child through its time with a minimum of<br> discomfort, bore him with little distress and recovered so quickly<br> that Mammy told her privately it was downright common--ladies<br> should suffer more. She felt little affection for the child, hide<br> the fact though she might. She had not wanted him and she<br> resented his coming and, now that he was here, it did not seem<br> possible that he was hers, a part of her.<br><br> Though she recovered physically from Wade's birth in a disgracefully<br> short time, mentally she was dazed and sick. Her spirits drooped,<br> despite the efforts of the whole plantation to revive them. Ellen<br> went about with a puckered, worried forehead and Gerald swore more<br> frequently than usual and brought her useless gifts from Jonesboro.<br> Even old Dr. Fontaine admitted that he was puzzled, after his tonic<br> of sulphur, molasses and herbs failed to perk her up. He told Ellen<br> privately that it was a broken heart that made Scarlett so irritable<br> and listless by turns. But Scarlett, had she wished to speak, could<br> have told them that it was a far different and more complex trouble.<br> She did not tell them that it was utter boredom, bewilderment at<br> actually being a mother and, most of all, the absence of Ashley that<br> made her look so woebegone.<br><br> Her boredom was acute and ever present. The County had been<br> devoid of any entertainment or social life ever since the Troop<br> had gone away to war. All of the interesting young men were gone--<br> the four Tarletons, the two Calverts, the Fontaines, the Munroes<br> and everyone from Jonesboro, Fayetteville and Lovejoy who was<br> young and attractive. Only the older men, the cripples and the<br> women were left, and they spent their time knitting and sewing,<br> growing more cotton and corn, raising more hogs and sheep and cows<br> for the army. There was never a sight of a real man except when<br> the commissary troop under Suellen's middle-aged beau, Frank<br> Kennedy, rode by every month to collect supplies. The men in the<br> commissary were not very exciting, and the sight of Frank's timid<br> courting annoyed her until she found it difficult to be polite to<br> him. If he and Suellen would only get it over with!<br><br> Even if the commissary troop had been more interesting, it would<br> not have helped her situation any. She was a widow and her heart<br> was in the grave. At least, everyone thought it was in the grave<br> and expected her to act accordingly. This irritated her for, try<br> as she would, she could recall nothing about Charles except the<br> dying-calf look on his face when she told him she would marry him.<br> And even that picture was fading. But she was a widow and she had<br> to watch her behavior. Not for her the pleasures of unmarried<br> girls. She had to be grave and aloof. Ellen had stressed this at<br> great length after catching Frank's lieutenant swinging Scarlett<br> in the garden swing and making her squeal with laughter. Deeply<br> distressed, Ellen had told her how easily a widow might get<br> herself talked about. The conduct of a widow must be twice as<br> circumspect as that of a matron.<br><br> ‘And God only knows,’ thought Scarlett, listening obediently to<br> her mother's soft voice, ‘matrons never have any fun at all. So<br> widows might as well be dead.’<br><br> A widow had to wear hideous black dresses without even a touch of<br> braid to enliven them, no flower or ribbon or lace or even<br> jewelry, except onyx mourning brooches or necklaces made from the<br> deceased's hair. And the black crepe veil on her bonnet had to<br> reach to her knees, and only after three years of widowhood could<br> it be shortened to shoulder length. Widows could never chatter<br> vivaciously or laugh aloud. Even when they smiled, it must be a<br> sad, tragic smile. And, most dreadful of all, they could in no<br> way indicate an interest in the company of gentlemen. And should<br> a gentleman be so ill bred as to indicate an interest in her, she<br> must freeze him with a dignified but well-chosen reference to her<br> dead husband. Oh, yes, thought Scarlett, drearily, some widows do<br> remarry eventually, when they are old and stringy. Though Heaven<br> knows how they manage it, with their neighbors watching. And then<br> it's generally to some desperate old widower with a large<br> plantation and a dozen children.<br><br> Marriage was bad enough, but to be widowed--oh, then life was over<br> forever! How stupid people were when they talked about what a<br> comfort little Wade Hampton must be to her, now that Charles was<br> gone. How stupid of them to say that now she had something to<br> live for! Everyone talked about how sweet it was that she had<br> this posthumous token of her love and she naturally did not<br> disabuse their minds. But that thought was farthest from her<br> mind. She had very little interest in Wade and sometimes it was<br> difficult to remember that he was actually hers.<br><br> Every morning she woke up and for a drowsy moment she was Scarlett<br> O'Hara again and the sun was bright in the magnolia outside her<br> window and the mockers were singing and the sweet smell of frying<br> bacon was stealing to her nostrils. She was carefree and young<br> again. Then she heard the fretful hungry wail and always--always<br> there was a startled moment when she thought: ‘Why, there's a<br> baby in the house!’ Then she remembered that it was her baby. It<br> was all very bewildering.<br><br> And Ashley! Oh, most of all Ashley! For the first time in her<br> life, she hated Tara, hated the long red road that led down the<br> hill to the river, hated the red fields with springing green<br> cotton. Every foot of ground, every tree and brook, every lane<br> and bridle path reminded her of him. He belonged to another woman<br> and he had gone to the war, but his ghost still haunted the roads<br> in the twilight, still smiled at her from drowsy gray eyes in the<br> shadows of the porch. She never heard the sound of hooves coming<br> up the river road from Twelve Oaks that for a sweet moment she did<br> not think--Ashley!<br><br> She hated Twelve Oaks now and once she had loved it. She hated it<br> but she was drawn there, so she could hear John Wilkes and the<br> girls talk about him--hear them read his letters from Virginia.<br> They hurt her but she had to hear them. She disliked the stiff-<br> necked India and the foolish prattling Honey and knew they<br> disliked her equally, but she could not stay away from them. And<br> every time she came home from Twelve Oaks, she lay down on her bed<br> morosely and refused to get up for supper.<br><br> It was this refusal of food that worried Ellen and Mammy more than<br> anything else. Mammy brought up tempting trays, insinuating that<br> now she was a widow she might eat as much as she pleased, but<br> Scarlett had no appetite.<br><br> When Dr. Fontaine told Ellen gravely that heartbreak frequently<br> led to a decline and women pined away into the grave, Ellen went<br> white, for that fear was what she had carried in her heart.<br><br> ‘Isn't there anything to be done, Doctor?’<br><br> ‘A change of scene will be the best thing in the world for her,’<br> said the doctor, only too anxious to be rid of an unsatisfactory<br> patient.<br><br> So Scarlett, unenthusiastic, went off with her child, first to<br> visit her O'Hara and Robillard relatives in Savannah and then to<br> Ellen's sisters, Pauline and Eulalie, in Charleston. But she was<br> back at Tara a month before Ellen expected her, with no<br> explanation of her return. They had been kind in Savannah, but<br> James and Andrew and their wives were old and content to sit<br> quietly and talk of a past in which Scarlett had no interest. It<br> was the same with the Robillards, and Charleston was terrible,<br> Scarlett thought.<br><br> Aunt Pauline and her husband, a little old man, with a formal,<br> brittle courtesy and the absent air of one living in an older age,<br> lived on a plantation on the river, far more isolated than Tara.<br> Their nearest neighbor was twenty miles away by dark roads through<br> still jungles of cypress swamp and oak. The live oaks with their<br> waving curtains of gray moss gave Scarlett the creeps and always<br> brought to her mind Gerald's stories of Irish ghosts roaming in<br> shimmering gray mists. There was nothing to do but knit all day<br> and at night listen to Uncle Carey read aloud from the improving<br> works of Mr. Bulwer-Lytton.<br><br> Eulalie, hidden behind a high-walled garden in a great house on<br> the Battery in Charleston, was no more entertaining. Scarlett,<br> accustomed to wide vistas of rolling red hills, felt that she was<br> in prison. There was more social life here than at Aunt<br> Pauline's, but Scarlett did not like the people who called, with<br> their airs and their traditions and their emphasis on family. She<br> knew very well they all thought she was a child of a mesalliance<br> and wondered how a Robillard ever married a newly come Irishman.<br> Scarlett felt that Aunt Eulalie apologized for her behind her<br> back. This aroused her temper, for she cared no more about family<br> than her father. She was proud of Gerald and what he had<br> accomplished unaided except by his shrewd Irish brain.<br><br> And the Charlestonians took so much upon themselves about Fort<br> Sumter! Good Heavens, didn't they realize that if they hadn't<br> been silly enough to fire the shot that started the war some other<br> fools would have done it? Accustomed to the brisk voices of<br> upland Georgia, the drawling flat voices of the low country seemed<br> affected to her. She thought if she ever again heard voices that<br> said ‘paams’ for ‘palms’ and ‘hoose’ for ‘house’ and ‘woon't’ for<br> ‘won't’ and ‘Maa and Paa’ for ‘Ma and Pa,’ she would scream. It<br> irritated her so much that during one formal call she aped<br> Gerald's brogue to her aunt's distress. Then she went back to<br> Tara. Better to be tormented with memories of Ashley than<br> Charleston accents.<br><br> Ellen, busy night and day, doubling the productiveness of Tara to<br> aid the Confederacy, was terrified when her eldest daughter came<br> home from Charleston thin, white and sharp tongued. She had known<br> heartbreak herself, and night after night she lay beside the<br> snoring Gerald, trying to think of some way to lessen Scarlett's<br> distress. Charles' aunt, Miss Pittypat Hamilton, had written her<br> several times, urging her to permit Scarlett to come to Atlanta<br> for a long visit, and now for the first time Ellen considered it<br> seriously.<br><br> She and Melanie were alone in a big house ‘and without male<br> protection,’ wrote Miss Pittypat, ‘now that dear Charlie has gone.<br> Of course, there is my brother Henry but he does not make his home<br> with us. But perhaps Scarlett has told you of Henry. Delicacy<br> forbids my putting more concerning him on paper. Melly and I<br> would feel so much easier and safer if Scarlett were with us.<br> Three lonely women are better than two. And perhaps dear Scarlett<br> could find some ease for her sorrow, as Melly is doing, by nursing<br> our brave boys in the hospitals here--and, of course, Melly and I<br> are longing to see the dear baby. . . .’<br><br> So Scarlett's trunk was packed again with her mourning clothes and<br> off she went to Atlanta with Wade Hampton and his nurse Prissy, a<br> headful of admonitions as to her conduct from Ellen and Mammy and<br> a hundred dollars in Confederate bills from Gerald. She did not<br> especially want to go to Atlanta. She thought Aunt Pitty the<br> silliest of old ladies and the very idea of living under the same<br> roof with Ashley's wife was abhorrent. But the County with its<br> memories was impossible now, and any change was welcome.</p><br>PART TWO<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER VIII<br><br> <br> As the train carried Scarlett northward that May morning in 1862,<br> she thought that Atlanta couldn't possibly be so boring as<br> Charleston and Savannah had been and, in spite of her distaste for<br> Miss Pittypat and Melanie, she looked forward with some curiosity<br> toward seeing how the town had fared since her last visit, in the<br> winter before the war began.<br><br> Atlanta had always interested her more than any other town because<br> when she was a child Gerald had told her that she and Atlanta were<br> exactly the same age. She discovered when she grew older that<br> Gerald had stretched the truth somewhat, as was his habit when a<br> little stretching would improve a story; but Atlanta was only nine<br> years older than she was, and that still left the place amazingly<br> young by comparison with any other town she had ever heard of.<br> Savannah and Charleston had the dignity of their years, one being<br> well along in its second century and the other entering its third,<br> and in her young eyes they had always seemed like aged<br> grandmothers fanning themselves placidly in the sun. But Atlanta<br> was of her own generation, crude with the crudities of youth and<br> as headstrong and impetuous as herself.<br><br> The story Gerald had told her was based on the fact that she and<br> Atlanta were christened in the same year. In the nine years<br> before Scarlett was born, the town had been called, first,<br> Terminus and then Marthasville, and not until the year of<br> Scarlett's birth had it become Atlanta.<br><br> When Gerald first moved to north Georgia, there had been no<br> Atlanta at all, not even the semblance of a village, and<br> wilderness rolled over the site. But the next year, in 1836, the<br> State had authorized the building of a railroad northwestward<br> through the territory which the Cherokees had recently ceded. The<br> destination of the proposed railroad, Tennessee and the West, was<br> clear and definite, but its beginning point in Georgia was<br> somewhat uncertain until, a year later, an engineer drove a stake<br> in the red clay to mark the southern end of the line, and Atlanta,<br> born Terminus, had begun.<br><br> There were no railroads then in north Georgia, and very few<br> anywhere else. But during the years before Gerald married Ellen,<br> the tiny settlement, twenty-five miles north of Tara, slowly grew<br> into a village and the tracks slowly pushed northward. Then the<br> railroad building era really began. From the old city of Augusta,<br> a second railroad was extended westward across the state to<br> connect with the new road to Tennessee. From the old city of<br> Savannah, a third railroad was built first to Macon, in the heart<br> of Georgia, and then north through Gerald's own county to Atlanta,<br> to link up with the other two roads and give Savannah's harbor a<br> highway to the West. From the same junction point, the young<br> Atlanta, a fourth railroad was constructed southwestward to<br> Montgomery and Mobile.<br><br> Born of a railroad, Atlanta grew as its railroads grew. With the<br> completion of the four lines, Atlanta was now connected with the<br> West, with the South, with the Coast and, through Augusta, with<br> the North and East. It had become the crossroads of travel north<br> and south and east and west, and the little village leaped to<br> life.<br><br> In a space of time but little longer than Scarlett's seventeen<br> years, Atlanta had grown from a single stake driven in the ground<br> into a thriving small city of ten thousand that was the center of<br> attention for the whole state. The older, quieter cities were<br> wont to look upon the bustling new town with the sensations of a<br> hen which has hatched a duckling. Why was the place so different<br> from the other Georgia towns? Why did it grow so fast? After<br> all, they thought, it had nothing whatever to recommend it--only<br> its railroads and a bunch of mighty pushy people.<br><br> The people who settled the town called successively Terminus,<br> Marthasville and Atlanta, were a pushy people. Restless,<br> energetic people from the older sections of Georgia and from more<br> distant states were drawn to this town that sprawled itself around<br> the junction of the railroads in its center. They came with<br> enthusiasm. They built their stores around the five muddy red<br> roads that crossed near the depot. They built their fine homes on<br> Whitehall and Washington streets and along the high ridge of land<br> on which countless generations of moccasined Indian feet had<br> beaten a path called the Peachtree Trail. They were proud of the<br> place, proud of its growth, proud of themselves for making it<br> grow. Let the older towns call Atlanta anything they pleased.<br> Atlanta did not care.<br><br> Scarlett had always liked Atlanta for the very same reasons that<br> made Savannah, Augusta and Macon condemn it. Like herself, the<br> town was a mixture of the old and new in Georgia, in which the old<br> often came off second best in its conflicts with the self-willed<br> and vigorous new. Moreover, there was something personal,<br> exciting about a town that was born--or at least christened--the<br> same year she was christened.<br><br> <br><br> The night before had been wild and wet with rain, but when<br> Scarlett arrived in Atlanta a warm sun was at work, bravely<br> attempting to dry the streets that were winding rivers of red mud.<br> In the open space around the depot, the soft ground had been cut<br> and churned by the constant flow of traffic in and out until it<br> resembled an enormous hog wallow, and here and there vehicles were<br> mired to the hubs in the ruts. A never-ceasing line of army<br> wagons and ambulances, loading and unloading supplies and wounded<br> from the trains, made the mud and confusion worse as they toiled<br> in and struggled out, drivers swearing, mules plunging and mud<br> spattering for yards.<br><br> Scarlett stood on the lower step of the train, a pale pretty<br> figure in her black mourning dress, her crepe veil fluttering<br> almost to her heels. She hesitated, unwilling to soil her<br> slippers and hems, and looked about in the shouting tangle of<br> wagons, buggies and carriages for Miss Pittypat. There was no<br> sign of that chubby pink-cheeked lady, but as Scarlett searched<br> anxiously a spare old negro, with grizzled kinks and an air of<br> dignified authority, came toward her through the mud, his hat in<br> his hand.<br><br> ‘Dis Miss Scarlett, ain' it? Dis hyah Peter, Miss Pitty's<br> coachman. Doan step down in dat mud,’ he ordered severely, as<br> Scarlett gathered up her skirts preparatory to descending. ‘You<br> is as bad as Miss Pitty an' she lak a chile 'bout gittin' her<br> feets wet. Lemme cahy you.’<br><br> He picked Scarlett up with ease despite his apparent frailness and<br> age and, observing Prissy standing on the platform of the train,<br> the baby in her arms, he paused: ‘Is dat air chile yo' nuss?<br> Miss Scarlett, she too young ter be handlin' Mist' Charles'<br> onlies' baby! But we ten' to dat later. You gal, foller me, an'<br> doan you go drappin' dat baby.’<br><br> Scarlett submitted meekly to being carried toward the carriage and<br> also to the peremptory manner in which Uncle Peter criticized her<br> and Prissy. As they went through the mud with Prissy sloshing,<br> pouting, after them, she recalled what Charles had said about<br> Uncle Peter.<br><br> ‘He went through all the Mexican campaigns with Father, nursed him<br> when he was wounded--in fact, he saved his life. Uncle Peter<br> practically raised Melanie and me, for we were very young when<br> Father and Mother died. Aunt Pitty had a falling out with her<br> brother, Uncle Henry, about that time, so she came to live with us<br> and take care of us. She is the most helpless soul--just like a<br> sweet grown-up child, and Uncle Peter treats her that way. To<br> save her life, she couldn't make up her mind about anything, so<br> Peter makes it up for her. He was the one who decided I should<br> have a larger allowance when I was fifteen, and he insisted that I<br> should go to Harvard for my senior year, when Uncle Henry wanted<br> me to take my degree at the University. And he decided when Melly<br> was old enough to put up her hair and go to parties. He tells<br> Aunt Pitty when it's too cold or too wet for her to go calling and<br> when she should wear a shawl. . . . He's the smartest old darky<br> I've ever seen and about the most devoted. The only trouble with<br> him is that he owns the three of us, body and soul, and he knows<br> it.’<br><br> Charles' words were confirmed as Peter climbed onto the box and<br> took the whip.<br><br> ‘Miss Pitty in a state bekase she din' come ter meet you. She's<br> feared you mout not unnerstan' but Ah tole her she an' Miss Melly<br> jes' git splashed wid mud an' ruin dey new dresses an' Ah'd<br> 'splain ter you. Miss Scarlett, you better tek dat chile. Dat<br> lil pickaninny gwine let it drap.’<br><br> Scarlett looked at Prissy and sighed. Prissy was not the most<br> adequate of nurses. Her recent graduation from a skinny<br> pickaninny with brief skirts and stiffly wrapped braids into the<br> dignity of a calico dress and starched white turban was an<br> intoxicating affair. She would never have arrived at this<br> eminence so early in life had not the exigencies of war and the<br> demands of the commissary department on Tara made it impossible<br> for Ellen to spare Mammy or Dilcey or even Rosa or Teena. Prissy<br> had never been more than a mile away from Twelve Oaks or Tara<br> before, and the trip on the train plus her elevation to nurse was<br> almost more than the brain in her little black skull could bear.<br> The twenty-mile journey from Jonesboro to Atlanta had so excited<br> her that Scarlett had been forced to hold the baby all the way.<br> Now, the sight of so many buildings and people completed Prissy's<br> demoralization. She twisted from side to side, pointed, bounced<br> about and so jounced the baby that he wailed miserably.<br><br> Scarlett longed for the fat old arms of Mammy. Mammy had only to<br> lay hands on a child and it hushed crying. But Mammy was at Tara<br> and there was nothing Scarlett could do. It was useless for her<br> to take little Wade from Prissy. He yelled just as loudly when<br> she held him as when Prissy did. Besides, he would tug at the<br> ribbons of her bonnet and, no doubt, rumple her dress. So she<br> pretended she had not heard Uncle Peter's suggestion.<br><br> ‘Maybe I'll learn about babies sometime,’ she thought irritably,<br> as the carriage jolted and swayed out of the morass surrounding<br> the station, ‘but I'm never going to like fooling with them.’ And<br> as Wade's face went purple with his squalling, she snapped<br> crossly: ‘Give him that sugar-tit in your pocket, Priss.<br> Anything to make him hush. I know he's hungry, but I can't do<br> anything about that now.’<br><br> Prissy produced the sugar-tit, given her that morning by Mammy,<br> and the baby's wails subsided. With quiet restored and with the<br> new sights that met her eyes, Scarlest's spirits began to rise a<br> little. When Uncle Peter finally maneuvered the carriage out of<br> the mudholes and onto Peachtree Street, she felt the first surge<br> of interest she had known in months. How the town had grown! It<br> was not much more than a year since she had last been here, and it<br> did not seem possible that the little Atlanta she knew could have<br> changed so much.<br><br> For the past year, she had been so engrossed in her own woes, so<br> bored by any mention of war, she did not know that from the minute<br> the fighting first began, Atlanta had been transformed. The same<br> railroads which had made the town the crossroads of commerce in<br> time of peace were now of vital strategic importance in time of<br> war. Far from the battle lines, the town and its railroads<br> provided the connecting link between the two armies of the<br> Confederacy, the army in Virginia and the army in Tennessee and<br> the West. And Atlanta likewise linked both of the armies with the<br> deeper South from which they drew their supplies. Now, in<br> response to the needs of war, Atlanta had become a manufacturing<br> center, a hospital base and one of the South's chief depots for<br> the collecting of food and supplies for the armies in the field.<br><br> Scarlett looked about her for the little town she remembered so<br> well. It was gone. The town she was now seeing was like a baby<br> grown overnight into a busy, sprawling giant.<br><br> Atlanta was humming like a beehive, proudly conscious of its<br> importance to the Confederacy, and work was going forward night<br> and day toward turning an agricultural section into an industrial<br> one. Before the war there had been few cotton factories, woolen<br> mills, arsenals and machine shops south of Maryland--a fact of<br> which all Southerners were proud. The South produced statesmen<br> and soldiers, planters and doctors, lawyers and poets, but<br> certainly not engineers or mechanics. Let the Yankees adopt such<br> low callings. But now the Confederate ports were stoppered with<br> Yankee gunboats, only a trickle of blockade-run goods was slipping<br> in from Europe, and the South was desperately trying to manufacture<br> her own war materials. The North could call on the whole world for<br> supplies and for soldiers, and thousands of Irish and Germans were<br> pouring into the Union Army, lured by the bounty money offered by<br> the North. The South could only turn in upon itself.<br><br> In Atlanta, there were machine factories tediously turning out<br> machinery to manufacture war materials--tediously, because there<br> were few machines in the South from which they could model and<br> nearly every wheel and cog had to be made from drawings that came<br> through the blockade from England. There were strange faces on<br> the streets of Atlanta now, and citizens who a year ago would have<br> pricked up their ears at the sound of even a Western accent paid<br> no heed to the foreign tongues of Europeans who had run the<br> blockade to build machines and turn out Confederate munitions.<br> Skilled men these, without whom the Confederacy would have been<br> hard put to make pistols, rifles, cannon and powder.<br><br> Almost the pulsing of the town's heart could be felt as the work<br> went forward night and day, pumping the materials of war up the<br> railway arteries to the two battle fronts. Trains roared in and<br> out of the town at all hours. Soot from the newly erected<br> factories fell in showers on the white houses. By night, the<br> furnaces glowed and the hammers clanged long after townsfolk were<br> abed. Where vacant lots had been a year before, there were now<br> factories turning out harness, saddles and shoes, ordnance-supply<br> plants making rifles and cannon, rolling mills and foundries<br> producing iron rails and freight cars to replace those destroyed<br> by the Yankees, and a variety of industries manufacturing spurs,<br> bridle bits, buckles, tents, buttons, pistols and swords. Already<br> the foundries were beginning to feel the lack of iron, for little<br> or none came through the blockade, and the mines in Alabama were<br> standing almost idle while the miners were at the front. There<br> were no iron picket fences, iron summerhouses, iron gates or even<br> iron statuary on the lawns of Atlanta now, for they had early<br> found their way into the melting pots of the rolling mills.<br><br> Here along Peachtree Street and near-by streets were the<br> headquarters of the various army departments, each office swarming<br> with uniformed men, the commissary, the signal corps, the mail<br> service, the railway transport, the provost marshal. On the<br> outskirts of town were the remount depots where horses and mules<br> milled about in large corrals, and along side streets were the<br> hospitals. As Uncle Peter told her about them, Scarlett felt that<br> Atlanta must be a city of the wounded, for there were general<br> hospitals, contagious hospitals, convalescent hospitals without<br> number. And every day the trains just below Five Points disgorged<br> more sick and more wounded.<br><br> The little town was gone and the face of the rapidly growing city<br> was animated with never-ceasing energy and bustle. The sight of<br> so much hurrying made Scarlett, fresh from rural leisure and<br> quiet, almost breathless, but she liked it. There was an exciting<br> atmosphere about the place that uplifted her. It was as if she<br> could actually feel the accelerated steady pulse of the town's<br> heart beating in time with her own.<br><br> As they slowly made their way through the mudholes of the town's<br> chief street, she noted with interest all the new buildings and<br> the new faces. The sidewalks were crowded with men in uniform,<br> bearing the insignia of all ranks and all service branches; the<br> narrow street was jammed with vehicles--carriages, buggies,<br> ambulances, covered army wagons with profane drivers swearing as<br> the mules struggled through the ruts; gray-clad couriers dashed<br> spattering through the streets from one headquarters to another,<br> bearing orders and telegraphic dispatches; convalescents limped<br> about on crutches, usually with a solicitous lady at either elbow;<br> bugle and drum and barked orders sounded from the drill fields<br> where the recruits were being turned into soldiers; and with her<br> heart in her throat, Scarlett had her first sight of Yankee<br> uniforms, as Uncle Peter pointed with his whip to a detachment of<br> dejected-looking bluecoats being shepherded toward the depot by a<br> squad of Confederates with fixed bayonets, to entrain for the<br> prison camp.<br><br> ‘Oh,’ thought Scarlett, with the first feeling of real pleasure<br> she had experienced since the day of the barbecue, ‘I'm going to<br> like it here! It's so alive and exciting!’<br><br> The town was even more alive than she realized, for there were new<br> barrooms by the dozens; prostitutes, following the army, swarmed<br> the town and bawdy houses were blossoming with women to the<br> consternation of the church people. Every hotel, boarding house<br> and private residence was crammed with visitors who had come to be<br> near wounded relatives in the big Atlanta hospitals. There were<br> parties and balls and bazaars every week and war weddings without<br> number, with the grooms on furlough in bright gray and gold braid<br> and the brides in blockade-run finery, aisles of crossed swords,<br> toasts drunk in blockaded champagne and tearful farewells.<br> Nightly the dark tree-lined streets resounded with dancing feet,<br> and from parlors tinkled pianos where soprano voices blended with<br> those of soldier guests in the pleasing melancholy of ‘The Bugles<br> Sang Truce’ and ‘Your Letter Came, but Came Too Late’--plaintive<br> ballads that brought exciting tears to soft eyes which had never<br> known the tears of real grief.<br><br> As they progressed down the street, through the sucking mud,<br> Scarlett bubbled over with questions and Peter answered them,<br> pointing here and there with his whip, proud to display his<br> knowledge.<br><br> ‘Dat air de arsenal. Yas'm, dey keeps guns an' sech lak dar.<br> No'm, dem air ain' sto's, dey's blockade awfisses. Law, Miss<br> Scarlett, doan you know whut blockade awfisses is? Dey's awfisses<br> whar furriners stays dat buy us Confedruts' cotton an' ship it<br> outer Cha'ston and Wilmin'ton an' ship us back gunpowder. No'm,<br> Ah ain' sho whut kine of furriners dey is.

It' frum de foun'ry an' de rollin' mills. An' de noise<br> dey meks at night! Kain nobody sleep. No'm, Ah kain stop fer you<br> ter look around. Ah done promise Miss Pitty Ah bring you straight<br> home. . . . Miss Scarlett, mek yo' cu'tsy. Dar's Miss<br> Merriwether an' Miss Elsing a-bowin' to you.’<br><br> Scarlett vaguely remembered two ladies of those names who came<br> from Atlanta to Tara to attend her wedding and she remembered that<br> they were Miss Pittypat's best friends. So she turned quickly<br> where Uncle Peter pointed and bowed. The two were sitting in a<br> carriage outside a drygoods store. The proprietor and two clerks<br> stood on the sidewalk with armfuls of bolts of cotton cloth they<br> had been displaying. Mrs. Merriwether was a tall, stout woman and<br> so tightly corseted that her bust jutted forward like the prow of<br> a ship. Her iron-gray hair was eked out by a curled false fringe<br> that was proudly brown and disdained to match the rest of her<br> hair. She had a round, highly colored face in which was combined<br> good-natured shrewdness and the habit of command. Mrs. Elsing was<br> younger, a thin frail woman, who had been a beauty, and about her<br> there still clung a faded freshness, a dainty imperious air.<br><br> These two ladies with a third, Mrs. Whiting, were the pillars of<br> Atlanta. They ran the three churches to which they belonged, the<br> clergy, the choirs and the parishioners. They organized bazaars<br> and presided over sewing circles, they chaperoned balls and<br> picnics, they knew who made good matches and who did not, who<br> drank secretly, who were to have babies and when. They were<br> authorities on the genealogies of everyone who was anyone in<br> Georgia, South Carolina and Virginia and did not bother their<br> heads about the other states, because they believed that no one<br> who was anybody ever came from states other than these three.<br> They knew what was decorous behavior and what was not and they<br> never failed to make their opinions known--Mrs. Merriwether at the<br> top of her voice, Mrs. Elsing in an elegant die-away drawl and<br> Mrs. Whiting in a distressed whisper which showed how much she<br> hated to speak of such things. These three ladies disliked and<br> distrusted one another as heartily as the First Triumvirate of<br> Rome, and their close alliance was probably for the same reason.<br><br> ‘I told Pitty I had to have you in my hospital,’ called Mrs.<br> Merriweather, smiling. ‘Don't you go promising Mrs. Meade or Mrs.<br> Whiting!’<br><br> ‘I won't,’ said Scarlett, having no idea what Mrs. Merriwether was<br> talking about but feeling a glow of warmth at being welcomed and<br> wanted. ‘I hope to see you again soon.’<br><br> The carriage plowed its way farther and halted for a moment to<br> permit two ladies with baskets of bandages on their arms to pick<br> precarious passages across the sloppy street on stepping stones.<br> At the same moment, Scarlett's eye was caught by a figure on the<br> sidewalk in a brightly colored dress--too bright for street wear--<br> covered by a Paisley shawl with fringes to the heels. Turning she<br> saw a tall handsome woman with a bold face and a mass of red hair,<br> too red to be true. It was the first time she had ever seen any<br> woman who she knew for certain had ‘done something to her hair’<br> and she watched her, fascinated.<br><br> ‘Uncle Peter, who is that?’ she whispered.<br><br> ‘Ah doan know.’<br><br> ‘You do, too. I can tell. Who is she?’<br><br> ‘Her name Belle Watling,’ said Uncle Peter, his lower lip<br> beginning to protrude.<br><br> Scarlett was quick to catch the fact that he had not preceded the<br> name with ‘Miss’ or ‘Mrs.’<br><br> ‘Who is she?’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett,’ said Peter darkly, laying the whip on the<br> startled horse, ‘Miss Pitty ain' gwine ter lak it you astin'<br> questions dat ain' none of yo' bizness. Dey's a passel of no-<br> count folks in dis town now dat it ain' no use talkin' about.’<br><br> ‘Good Heavens!’ thought Scarlett, reproved into silence. ‘That<br> must be a bad woman!’<br><br> She had never seen a bad woman before and she twisted her head and<br> stared after her until she was lost in the crowd.<br><br> The stores and the new war buildings were farther apart now, with<br> vacant lots between. Finally the business section fell behind and<br> the residences came into view. Scarlett picked them out as old<br> friends, the Leyden house, dignified and stately; the Bonnells',<br> with little white columns and green blinds; the close-lipped red-<br> brick Georgian home of the McLure family, behind its low box<br> hedges. Their progress was slower now, for from porches and<br> gardens and sidewalks ladies called to her. Some she knew<br> slightly, others she vaguely remembered, but most of them she knew<br> not at all. Pittypat had certainly broadcast her arrival. Little<br> Wade had to be held up time and again, so that ladies who ventured<br> as far through the ooze as their carriage blocks could exclaim<br> over him. They all cried to her that she must join their knitting<br> and sewing circles and their hospital committees, and no one<br> else's, and she promised recklessly to right and left.<br><br> As they passed a rambling green clapboard house, a little black<br> girl posted on the front steps cried, ‘Hyah she come,’ and Dr.<br> Meade and his wife and little thirteen-year-old Phil emerged,<br> calling greetings. Scarlett recalled that they too had been at<br> her wedding. Mrs. Meade mounted her carriage block and craned her<br> neck for a view of the baby, but the doctor, disregarding the mud,<br> plowed through to the side of the carriage. He was tall and gaunt<br> and wore a pointed beard of iron gray, and his clothes hung on his<br> spare figure as though blown there by a hurricane. Atlanta<br> considered him the root of all strength and all wisdom and it was<br> not strange that he had absorbed something of their belief. But<br> for all his habit of making oracular statements and his slightly<br> pompous manner, he was as kindly a man as the town possessed.<br><br> After shaking her hand and prodding Wade in the stomach and<br> complimenting him, the doctor announced that Aunt Pittypat had<br> promised on oath that Scarlett should be on no other hospital and<br> bandage-rolling committee save Mrs. Meade's.<br><br> ‘Oh, dear, but I've promised a thousand ladies already!’ said<br> Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Merriwether, I'll be bound!’ cried Mrs. Meade indignantly.<br> ‘Drat the woman! I believe she meets every train!’<br><br> ‘I promised because I hadn't a notion what it was all about,’<br> Scarlett confessed. ‘What are hospital committees anyway?’<br><br> Both the doctor and his wife looked slightly shocked at her<br> ignorance.<br><br> ‘But, of course, you've been buried in the country and couldn't<br> know,’ Mrs. Meade apologized for her. ‘We have nursing committees<br> for different hospitals and for different days. We nurse the men<br> and help the doctors and make bandages and clothes and when the<br> men are well enough to leave the hospitals we take them into our<br> homes to convalesce till they are able to go back in the army.<br> And we look after the wives and families of some of the wounded<br> who are destitute--yes, worse than destitute. Dr. Meade is at the<br> Institute hospital where my committee works, and everyone says<br> he's marvelous and--’<br><br> ‘There, there, Mrs. Meade,’ said the doctor fondly. ‘Don't go<br> bragging on me in front of folks. It's little enough I can do,<br> since you wouldn't let me go in the army.’<br><br> ‘'Wouldn't let!'‘ she cried indignantly. ‘Me? The town wouldn't<br> let you and you know it. Why, Scarlett, when folks heard he was<br> intending to go to Virginia as an army surgeon, all the ladies<br> signed a petition begging him to stay here. Of course, the town<br> couldn't do without you.’<br><br> ‘There, there, Mrs. Meade,’ said the doctor, basking obviously in<br> the praise. ‘Perhaps with one boy at the front, that's enough for<br> the time being.’<br><br> ‘And I'm going next year!’ cried little Phil hopping about<br> excitedly. ‘As a drummer boy. I'm learning how to drum now. Do<br> you want to hear me? I'll run get my drum.’<br><br> ‘No, not now,’ said Mrs. Meade, drawing him closer to her, a<br> sudden look of strain coming over her face. ‘Not next year,<br> darling. Maybe the year after.’<br><br> ‘But the war will be over then!’ he cried petulantly, pulling away<br> from her. ‘And you promised!’<br><br> Over his head the eyes of the parents met and Scarlett saw the<br> look. Darcy Meade was in Virginia and they were clinging closer<br> to the little boy that was left.<br><br> Uncle Peter cleared his throat.<br><br> ‘Miss Pitty were in a state when Ah lef' home an' ef Ah doan git<br> dar soon, she'll done swooned.’<br><br> ‘Good-by. I'll be over this afternoon,’ called Mrs. Meade. ‘And<br> you tell Pitty for me that if you aren't on my committee, she's<br> going to be in a worse state.’<br><br> The carriage slipped and slid down the muddy road and Scarlett<br> leaned back on the cushions and smiled. She felt better now than<br> she had felt in months. Atlanta, with its crowds and its hurry<br> and its undercurrent of driving excitement, was very pleasant,<br> very exhilarating, so very much nicer than the lonely plantation<br> out from Charleston, where the bellow of alligators broke the<br> night stillness; better than Charleston itself, dreaming in its<br> gardens behind its high walls; better than Savannah with its wide<br> streets lined with palmetto and the muddy river beside it. Yes,<br> and temporarily even better than Tara, dear though Tara was.<br><br> There was something exciting about this town with its narrow muddy<br> streets, lying among rolling red hills, something raw and crude<br> that appealed to the rawness and crudeness underlying the fine<br> veneer that Ellen and Mammy had given her. She suddenly felt that<br> this was where she belonged, not in serene and quiet old cities,<br> flat beside yellow waters.<br><br> The houses were farther and farther apart now, and leaning out<br> Scarlett saw the red brick and slate roof of Miss Pittypat's<br> house. It was almost the last house on the north side of town.<br> Beyond it, Peachtree road narrowed and twisted under great trees<br> out of sight into thick quiet woods. The neat wooden-paneled<br> fence had been newly painted white and the front yard it inclosed<br> was yellow starred with the last jonquils of the season. On the<br> front steps stood two women in black and behind them a large<br> yellow woman with her hands under her apron and her white teeth<br> showing in a wide smile. Plump Miss Pittypat was teetering<br> excitedly on tiny feet, one hand pressed to her copious bosom to<br> still her fluttering heart. Scarlett saw Melanie standing by her<br> and, with a surge of dislike, she realized that the fly in the<br> ointment of Atlanta would be this slight little person in black<br> mourning dress, her riotous dark curls subdued to matronly<br> smoothness and a loving smile of welcome and happiness on her<br> heart-shaped face.<br><br> <br><br> When a Southerner took the trouble to pack a trunk and travel<br> twenty miles for a visit, the visit was seldom of shorter duration<br> than a month, usually much longer. Southerners were as<br> enthusiastic visitors as they were hosts, and there was nothing<br> unusual in relatives coming to spend the Christmas holidays and<br> remaining until July. Often when newly married couples went on<br> the usual round of honeymoon visits, they lingered in some<br> pleasant home until the birth of their second child. Frequently<br> elderly aunts and uncles came to Sunday dinner and remained until<br> they were buried years later. Visitors presented no problem, for<br> houses were large, servants numerous and the feeding of several<br> extra mouths a minor matter in that land of plenty. All ages and<br> sexes went visiting, honeymooners, young mothers showing off new<br> babies, convalescents, the bereaved, girls whose parents were<br> anxious to remove them from the dangers of unwise matches, girls<br> who had reached the danger age without becoming engaged and who,<br> it was hoped, would make suitable matches under the guidance of<br> relatives in other places. Visitors added excitement and variety<br> to the slow-moving Southern life and they were always welcome.<br><br> So Scarlett had come to Atlanta with no idea as to how long she<br> would remain. If her visit proved as dull as those in Savannah<br> and Charleston, she would return home in a month. If her stay was<br> pleasant, she would remain indefinitely. But no sooner had she<br> arrived than Aunt Pitty and Melanie began a campaign to induce her<br> to make her home permanently with them. They brought up every<br> possible argument. They wanted her for her own self because they<br> loved her. They were lonely and often frightened at night in the<br> big house, and she was so brave she gave them courage. She was so<br> charming that she cheered them in their sorrow. Now that Charles<br> was dead, her place and her son's place were with his kindred.<br> Besides, half the house now belonged to her, through Charles'<br> will. Last, the Confederacy needed every pair of hands for<br> sewing, knitting, bandage rolling and nursing the wounded.<br><br> Charles' Uncle Henry Hamilton, who lived in bachelor state at the<br> Atlanta Hotel near the depot, also talked seriously to her on this<br> subject. Uncle Henry was a short, pot-bellied, irascible old<br> gentleman with a pink face, a shock of long silver hair and an<br> utter lack of patience with feminine timidities and vaporings. It<br> was for the latter reason that he was barely on speaking terms<br> with his sister, Miss Pittypat. From childhood, they had been<br> exact opposites in temperament and they had been further estranged<br> by his objections to the manner in which she had reared Charles--<br> ‘Making a damn sissy out of a soldier's son!’ Years before, he<br> had so insulted her that now Miss Pitty never spoke of him except<br> in guarded whispers and with so great reticence that a stranger<br> would have thought the honest old lawyer a murderer, at the least.<br> The insult had occurred on a day when Pitty wished to draw five<br> hundred dollars from her estate, of which he was trustee, to<br> invest in a non-existent gold mine. He had refused to permit it<br> and stated heatedly that she had no more sense than a June bug and<br> furthermore it gave him the fidgets to be around her longer than<br> five minutes. Since that day, she only saw him formally, once a<br> month, when Uncle Peter drove her to his office to get the<br> housekeeping money. After these brief visits, Pitty always took<br> to her bed for the rest of the day with tears and smelling salts.<br> Melanie and Charles, who were on excellent terms with their uncle,<br> had frequently offered to relieve her of this ordeal, but Pitty<br> always set her babyish mouth firmly and refused. Henry was her<br> cross and she must bear him. From this, Charles and Melanie could<br> only infer that she took a profound pleasure in this occasional<br> excitement, the only excitement in her sheltered life.<br><br> Uncle Henry liked Scarlett immediately because, he said, he could<br> see that for all her silly affectations she had a few grains of<br> sense. He was trustee, not only of Pitty's and Melanie's estates,<br> but also of that left Scarlett by Charles. It came to Scarlett as<br> a pleasant surprise that she was now a well-to-do young woman, for<br> Charles had not only left her half of Aunt Pitty's house but farm<br> lands and town property as well. And the stores and warehouses<br> along the railroad track near the depot, which were part of her<br> inheritance, had tripled in value since the war began. It was<br> when Uncle Henry was giving her an account of her property that he<br> broached the matter of her permanent residence in Atlanta.<br><br> ‘When Wade Hampton comes of age, he's going to be a rich young<br> man,’ he said. ‘The way Atlanta is growing his property will be<br> ten times more valuable in twenty years, and it's only right that<br> the boy should be raised where his property is, so he can learn to<br> take care of it--yes, and of Pitty's and Melanie's, too. He'll be<br> the only man of the Hamilton name left before long, for I won't be<br> here forever.’<br><br> As for Uncle Peter, he took it for granted that Scarlett had come<br> to stay. It was inconceivable to him that Charles' only son<br> should be reared where he could not supervise the rearing. To all<br> these arguments, Scarlett smiled but said nothing, unwilling to<br> commit herself before learning how she would like Atlanta and<br> constant association with her in-laws. She knew, too, that Gerald<br> and Ellen would have to be won over. Moreover, now that she was<br> away from Tara, she missed it dreadfully, missed the red fields<br> and the springing green cotton and the sweet twilight silences.<br> For the first time, she realized dimly what Gerald had meant when<br> he said that the love of the land was in her blood.<br><br> So she gracefully evaded, for the time being, a definite answer as<br> to the duration of her visit and slipped easily into the life of<br> the red-brick house at the quiet end of Peachtree Street.<br><br> Living with Charles' blood kin, seeing the home from which he<br> came. Scarlett could now understand a little better the boy who<br> had made her wife, widow and mother in such rapid succession. It<br> was easy to see why he had been so shy, so unsophisticated, so<br> idealistic. If Charles had inherited any of the qualities of the<br> stern, fearless, hot-tempered soldier who had been his father,<br> they had been obliterated in childhood by the ladylike atmosphere<br> in which he had been reared. He had been devoted to the childlike<br> Pitty and closer than brothers usually are to Melanie, and two<br> more sweet, unworldly women could not be found.<br><br> Aunt Pittypat had been christened Sarah Jane Hamilton sixty years<br> before, but since the long-past day when her doting father had<br> fastened his nickname upon her, because of her airy, restless,<br> pattering little feet, no one had called her anything else. In<br> the years that followed that second christening, many changes had<br> taken place in her that made the pet name incongruous. Of the<br> swiftly scampering child, all that now remained were two tiny<br> feet, inadequate to her weight, and a tendency to prattle happily<br> and aimlessly. She was stout, pink-cheeked and silver-haired and<br> always a little breathless from too tightly laced stays. She was<br> unable to walk more than a block on the tiny feet which she<br> crammed into too small slippers. She had a heart which fluttered<br> at any excitement and she pampered it shamelessly, fainting at any<br> provocation. Everyone knew that her swoons were generally mere<br> ladylike pretenses but they loved her enough to refrain from<br> saying so. Everyone loved her, spoiled her like a child and<br> refused to take her seriously--everyone except her brother Henry.<br><br> She liked gossip better than anything else in the world, even more<br> than she liked the pleasures of the table, and she prattled on for<br> hours about other people's affairs in a harmless kindly way. She<br> had no memory for names, dates or places and frequently confused<br> the actors in one Atlanta drama with the actors in another, which<br> misled no one for no one was foolish enough to take seriously<br> anything she said. No one ever told her anything really shocking<br> or scandalous, for her spinster state must be protected even if<br> she was sixty years old, and her friends were in a kindly<br> conspiracy to keep her a sheltered and petted old child.<br><br> Melanie was like her aunt in many ways. She had her shyness, her<br> sudden blushes, her modesty, but she did have common sense--’Of a<br> sort, I'll admit that,’ Scarlett thought grudgingly. Like Aunt<br> Pitty, Melanie had the face of a sheltered child who had never<br> known anything but simplicity and kindness, truth and love, a<br> child who had never looked upon harshness or evil and would not<br> recognize them if she saw them. Because she had always been<br> happy, she wanted everyone about her to be happy or, at least,<br> pleased with themselves. To this end, she always saw the best in<br> everyone and remarked kindly upon it. There was no servant so<br> stupid that she did not find some redeeming trait of loyalty and<br> kind-heartedness, no girl so ugly and disagreeable that she could<br> not discover grace of form or nobility of character in her, and no<br> man so worthless or so boring that she did not view him in the<br> light of his possibilities rather than his actualities.<br><br> Because of these qualities that came sincerely and spontaneously<br> from a generous heart, everyone flocked about her, for who can<br> resist the charm of one who discovers in others admirable<br> qualities undreamed of even by himself? She had more girl friends<br> than anyone in town and more men friends too, though she had few<br> beaux for she lacked the willfulness and selfishness that go far<br> toward trapping men's hearts.<br><br> What Melanie did was no more than all Southern girls were taught<br> to do--to make those about them feel at ease and pleased with<br> themselves. It was this happy feminine conspiracy which made<br> Southern society so pleasant. Women knew that a land where men<br> were contented, uncontradicted and safe in possession of<br> unpunctured vanity was likely to be a very pleasant place for<br> women to live. So, from the cradle to the grave, women strove to<br> make men pleased with themselves, and the satisfied men repaid<br> lavishly with gallantry and adoration. In fact, men willingly<br> gave the ladies everything in the world except credit for having<br> intelligence. Scarlett exercised the same charms as Melanie but<br> with a studied artistry and consummate skill. The difference<br> between the two girls lay in the fact that Melanie spoke kind and<br> flattering words from a desire to make people happy, if only<br> temporarily, and Scarlett never did it except to further her own<br> aims.<br><br> From the two he loved best, Charles had received no toughening<br> influences, learned nothing of harshness or reality, and the home<br> in which he grew to manhood was as soft as a bird's nest. It was<br> such a quiet, old-fashioned, gentle home compared with Tara. To<br> Scarlett, this house cried out for the masculine smells of brandy,<br> tobacco and Macassar oil, for hoarse voices and occasional curses,<br> for guns, for whiskers, for saddles and bridles and for hounds<br> underfoot. She missed the sounds of quarreling voices that were<br> always heard at Tara when Ellen's back was turned, Mammy quarreling<br> with Pork, Rosa and Teena bickering, her own acrimonious arguments<br> with Suellen, Gerald's bawling threats. No wonder Charles had been<br> a sissy, coming from a home like this. Here, excitement never<br> entered in, voices were never raised, everyone deferred gently to<br> the opinions of others, and, in the end, the black grizzled autocrat<br> in the kitchen had his way. Scarlett, who had hoped for a freer<br> rein when she escaped Mammy's supervision, discovered to her sorrow<br> that Uncle Peter's standards of ladylike conduct, especially for<br> Mist' Charles' widow, were even stricter than Mammy's.<br><br> In such a household, Scarlett came back to herself, and almost<br> before she realized it her spirits rose to normal. She was only<br> seventeen, she had superb health and energy, and Charles' people<br> did their best to make her happy. If they fell a little short of<br> this, it was not their fault, for no one could take out of her<br> heart the ache that throbbed whenever Ashley's name was mentioned.<br> And Melanie mentioned it so often! But Melanie and Pitty were<br> tireless in planning ways to soothe the sorrow under which they<br> thought she labored. They put their own grief into the background<br> in order to divert her. They fussed about her food and her hours<br> for taking afternoon naps and for taking carriage rides. They not<br> only admired her extravagantly, her high-spiritedness, her figure,<br> her tiny hands and feet, her white skin, but they said so<br> frequently, petting, hugging and kissing her to emphasize their<br> loving words.<br><br> Scarlett did not care for the caresses, but she basked in the<br> compliments. No one at Tara had ever said so many charming things<br> about her. In fact, Mammy had spent her time deflating her<br> conceit. Little Wade was no longer an annoyance, for the family,<br> black and white, and the neighbors idolized him and there was a<br> never-ceasing rivalry as to whose lap he should occupy. Melanie<br> especially doted on him. Even in his worst screaming spells,<br> Melanie thought him adorable and said so, adding, ‘Oh, you<br> precious darling! I just wish you were mine!’<br><br> Sometimes Scarlett found it hard to dissemble her feelings, for<br> she still thought Aunt Pitty the silliest of old ladies and her<br> vagueness and vaporings irritated her unendurably. She disliked<br> Melanie with a jealous dislike that grew as the days went by, and<br> sometimes she had to leave the room abruptly when Melanie, beaming<br> with loving pride, spoke of Ashley or read his letters aloud.<br> But, all in all, life went on as happily as was possible under the<br> circumstances. Atlanta was more interesting than Savannah or<br> Charleston or Tara and it offered so many strange war-time<br> occupations she had little time to think or mope. But, sometimes,<br> when she blew out the candle and burrowed her head into the<br> pillow, she sighed and thought: ‘If only Ashley wasn't married!<br> If only I didn't have to nurse in that plagued hospital! Oh, if<br> only I could have some beaux!’<br><br> She had immediately loathed nursing but she could not escape this<br> duty because she was on both Mrs. Meade's and Mrs. Merriwether's<br> committees. That meant four mornings a week in the sweltering,<br> stinking hospital with her hair tied up in a towel and a hot apron<br> covering her from neck to feet. Every matron, old or young, in<br> Atlanta nursed and did it with an enthusiasm that seemed to<br> Scarlett little short of fanatic. They took it for granted that<br> she was imbued with their own patriotic fervor and would have been<br> shocked to know how slight an interest in the war she had. Except<br> for the ever-present torment that Ashley might be killed, the war<br> interested her not at all, and nursing was something she did<br> simply because she didn't know how to get out of it.<br><br> Certainly there was nothing romantic about nursing. To her, it<br> meant groans, delirium, death and smells. The hospitals were<br> filled with dirty, bewhiskered, verminous men who smelled terribly<br> and bore on their bodies wounds hideous enough to turn a<br> Christian's stomach. The hospitals stank of gangrene, the odor<br> assaulting her nostrils long before the doors were reached, a<br> sickish sweet smell that clung to her hands and hair and haunted<br> her in her dreams. Flies, mosquitoes and gnats hovered in<br> droning, singing swarms over the wards, tormenting the men to<br> curses and weak sobs; and Scarlett, scratching her own mosquito<br> bites, swung palmetto fans until her shoulders ached and she<br> wished that all the men were dead.<br><br> Melanie, however, did not seem to mind the smells, the wounds or<br> the nakedness, which Scarlett thought strange in one who was the<br> most timorous and modest of women. Sometimes when holding basins<br> and instruments while Dr. Meade cut out gangrened flesh, Melanie<br> looked very white. And once, alter such an operation, Scarlett<br> found her in the linen closet vomiting quietly into a towel. But<br> as long as she was where the wounded could see her, she was<br> gentle, sympathetic and cheerful, and the men in the hospitals<br> called her an angel of mercy. Scarlett would have liked that<br> title too, but it involved touching men crawling with lice,<br> running fingers down throats of unconscious patients to see if<br> they were choking on swallowed tobacco quids, bandaging stumps and<br> picking maggots out of festering flesh. No, she did not like<br> nursing!<br><br> Perhaps it might have been endurable if she had been permitted to<br> use her charms on the convalescent men, for many of them were<br> attractive and well born, but this she could not do in her widowed<br> state. The young ladies of the town, who were not permitted to<br> nurse for fear they would see sights unfit for virgin eyes, had<br> the convalescent wards in their charge. Unhampered by matrimony<br> or widowhood, they made vast inroads on the convalescents, and<br> even the least attractive girls, Scarlett observed gloomily, had<br> no difficulty in getting engaged.<br><br> With the exception of desperately ill and severely wounded men,<br> Scarlett's was a completely feminized world and this irked her,<br> for she neither liked nor trusted her own sex and, worse still,<br> was always bored by it. But on three afternoons a week she had to<br> attend sewing circles and bandage-rolling committees of Melanie's<br> friends. The girls who had all known Charles were very kind and<br> attentive to her at these gatherings, especially Fanny Elsing and<br> Maybelle Merriwether, the daughters of the town dowagers. But<br> they treated her deferentially, as if she were old and finished,<br> and their constant chatter of dances and beaux made her both<br> envious of their pleasures and resentful that her widowhood barred<br> her from such activities. Why, she was three times as attractive<br> as Fanny and Maybelle! Oh, how unfair life was! How unfair that<br> everyone should think her heart was in the grave when it wasn't at<br> all! It was in Virginia with Ashley!<br><br> But in spite of these discomforts, Atlanta pleased her very well.<br> And her visit lengthened as the weeks slipped by.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER IX<br><br> <br> Scarlett sat in the window of her bedroom that midsummer morning<br> and disconsolately watched the wagons and carriages full of girls,<br> soldiers and chaperons ride gaily out Peachtree road in search of<br> woodland decorations for the bazaar which was to be held that<br> evening for the benefit of the hospitals. The red road lay<br> checkered in shade and sun glare beneath the over-arching trees<br> and the many hooves kicked up little red clouds of dust. One<br> wagon, ahead of the others, bore four stout negroes with axes to<br> cut evergreens and drag down the vines, and the back of this wagon<br> was piled high with napkin-covered hampers, split-oak baskets of<br> lunch and a dozen watermelons. Two of the black bucks were<br> equipped with banjo and harmonica and they were rendering a<br> spirited version of ‘If You Want to Have a Good Time, Jine the<br> Cavalry.’ Behind them streamed the merry cavalcade, girls cool in<br> flowered cotton dresses, with light shawls, bonnets and mitts to<br> protect their skins and little parasols held over their heads;<br> elderly ladies placid and smiling amid the laughter and carriage-<br> to-carriage calls and jokes; convalescents from the hospitals<br> wedged in between stout chaperons and slender girls who made great<br> fuss and to-do over them; officers on horseback idling at snail's<br> pace beside the carriages--wheels creaking, spurs jingling, gold<br> braid gleaming, parasols bobbing, fans swishing, negroes singing.<br> Everybody was riding out Peachtree road to gather greenery and<br> have a picnic and melon cutting. Everybody, thought Scarlett,<br> morosely, except me.<br><br> They all waved and called to her as they went by and she tried to<br> respond with a good grace, but it was difficult. A hard little<br> pain had started in her heart and was traveling slowly up toward<br> her throat where it would become a lump and the lump would soon<br> become tears. Everybody was going to the picnic except her. And<br> everybody was going to the bazaar and the ball tonight except her.<br> That is everybody except her and Pittypat and Melly and the other<br> unfortunates in town who were in mourning. But Melly and Pittypat<br> did not seem to mind. It had not even occurred to them to want to<br> go. It had occurred to Scarlett. And she did want to go,<br> tremendously.<br><br> It simply wasn't fair. She had worked twice as hard as any girl<br> in town, getting things ready for the bazaar. She had knitted<br> socks and baby caps and afghans and mufflers and tatted yards of<br> lace and painted china hair receivers and mustache cups. And she<br> had embroidered half a dozen sofa-pillow cases with the<br> Confederate flag on them. (The stars were a bit lopsided, to be<br> sure, some of them being almost round and others having six or<br> even seven points, but the effect was good.) Yesterday she had<br> worked until she was worn out in the dusty old barn of an Armory<br> draping yellow and pink and green cheesecloth on the booths that<br> lined the walls. Under the supervision of the Ladies' Hospital<br> Committee, this was plain hard work and no fun at all. It was<br> never fun to be around Mrs. Merriwether and Mrs. Elsing and Mrs.<br> Whiting and have them boss you like you were one of the darkies.<br> And have to listen to them brag about how popular their daughters<br> were. And, worst of all, she had burned two blisters on her<br> fingers helping Pittypat and Cookie make layer cakes for raffling.<br><br> And now, having worked like a field hand, she had to retire<br> decorously when the fun was just beginning. Oh, it wasn't fair<br> that she should have a dead husband and a baby yelling in the next<br> room and be out of everything that was pleasant. Just a little<br> over a year ago, she was dancing and wearing bright clothes<br> instead of this dark mourning and was practically engaged to three<br> boys. She was only seventeen now and there was still a lot of<br> dancing left in her feet. Oh, it wasn't fair! Life was going<br> past her, down a hot shady summer road, life with gray uniforms<br> and jingling spurs and flowered organdie dresses and banjos<br> playing. She tried not to smile and wave too enthusiastically to<br> the men she knew best, the ones she'd nursed in the hospital, but<br> it was hard to subdue her dimples, hard to look as though her<br> heart were in the grave--when it wasn't.<br><br> Her bowing and waving were abruptly halted when Pittypat entered<br> the room, panting as usual from climbing the stairs, and jerked<br> her away from the window unceremoniously.<br><br> ‘Have you lost your mind, honey, waving at men out of your bedroom<br> window? I declare, Scarlett, I'm shocked! What would your mother<br> say?’<br><br> ‘Well, they didn't know it was my bedroom.’<br><br> ‘But they'd suspect it was your bedroom and that's just as bad.<br> Honey, you mustn't do things like that. Everybody will be talking<br> about you and saying you are fast--and anyway, Mrs. Merriwether<br> knew it was your bedroom.’<br><br> ‘And I suppose she'll tell all the boys, the old cat.’<br><br> ‘Honey, hush! Dolly Merriwether's my best friend.’<br><br> ‘Well, she's a cat just the same--oh, I'm sorry, Auntie, don't<br> cry! I forgot it was my bedroom window. I won't do it again--I--<br> I just wanted to see them go by. I wish I was going.’<br><br> ‘Honey!’<br><br> ‘Well, I do. I'm so tired of sitting at home.’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, promise me you won't say things like that. People<br> would talk so. They'd say you didn't have the proper respect for<br> poor Charlie--’<br><br> ‘Oh, Auntie, don't cry!’<br><br> ‘Oh, now I've made you cry, too,’ sobbed Pittypat, in a pleased<br> way, fumbling in her skirt pocket for her handkerchief.<br><br> The hard little pain had at last reached Scarlett's throat and she<br> wailed out loud--not, as Pittypat thought, for poor Charlie but<br> because the last sounds of the wheels and the laughter were dying<br> away. Melanie rustled in from her room, a worried frown puckering<br> her forehead, a brush in her hands, her usually tidy black hair,<br> freed of its net, fluffing about her face in a mass of tiny curls<br> and waves.<br><br> ‘Darlings! What is the matter?’<br><br> ‘Charlie!’ sobbed Pittypat, surrendering utterly to the pleasure<br> of her grief and burying her head on Melly's shoulder.<br><br> ‘Oh,’ said Melly, her lip quivering at the mention of her<br> brother's name. ‘Be brave, dear. Don't cry. Oh, Scarlett!’<br><br> Scarlett had thrown herself on the bed and was sobbing at the top<br> of her voice, sobbing for her lost youth and the pleasures of<br> youth that were denied her, sobbing with the indignation and<br> despair of a child who once could get anything she wanted by<br> sobbing and now knows that sobbing can no longer help her. She<br> burrowed her head in the pillow and cried and kicked her feet at<br> the tufted counterpane.<br><br> ‘I might as well be dead!’ she sobbed passionately. Before such<br> an exhibition of grief, Pittypat's easy tears ceased and Melly<br> flew to the bedside to comfort her sister-in-law.<br><br> ‘Dear, don't cry! Try to think how much Charlie loved you and let<br> that comfort you! Try to think of your darling baby.’<br><br> Indignation at being misunderstood mingled with Scarlett's forlorn<br> feeling of being out of everything and strangled all utterance.<br> That was fortunate, for if she could have spoken she would have<br> cried out truths couched in Gerald's forthright words. Melanie<br> patted her shoulder and Pittypat tiptoed heavily about the room<br> pulling down the shades.<br><br> ‘Don't do that!’ shouted Scarlett, raising a red and swollen face<br> from the pillow. ‘I'm not dead enough for you to pull down the<br> shades--though I might as well be. Oh, do go away and leave me<br> alone!’<br><br> She sank her face into the pillow again and, after a whispered<br> conference, the two standing over her tiptoed out. She heard<br> Melanie say to Pittypat in a low voice as they went down the<br> stairs:<br><br> ‘Aunt Pitty, I wish you wouldn't speak of Charles to her. You<br> know how it always affects her. Poor thing, she gets that queer<br> look and I know she's trying not to cry. We mustn't make it<br> harder for her.’<br><br> Scarlett kicked the coverlet in impotent rage, trying to think of<br> something bad enough to say.<br><br> ‘God's nightgown!’ she cried at last, and felt somewhat relieved.<br> How could Melanie be content to stay at home and never have any<br> fun and wear crepe for her brother when she was only eighteen<br> years old? Melanie did not seem to know, or care, that life was<br> riding by with jingling spurs.<br><br> ‘But she's such a stick,’ thought Scarlett, pounding the pillow.<br> ‘And she never was popular like me, so she doesn't miss the things<br> I miss. And--and besides she's got Ashley and I--I haven't got<br> anybody!’ And at this fresh woe, she broke into renewed outcries.<br><br> She remained gloomily in her room until afternoon and then the<br> sight of the returning picnickers with wagons piled high with pine<br> boughs, vines and ferns did not cheer her. Everyone looked<br> happily tired as they waved to her again and she returned their<br> greetings drearily. Life was a hopeless affair and certainly not<br> worth living.<br><br> Deliverance came in the form she least expected when, during the<br> after-dinner-nap period, Mrs. Merriwether and Mrs. Elsing drove<br> up. Startled at having callers at such an hour, Melanie, Scarlett<br> and Aunt Pittypat roused themselves, hastily hooked their basques,<br> smoothed their hair and descended to the parlor.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Bonnell's children have the measles,’ said Mrs. Merriwether<br> abruptly, showing plainly that she held Mrs. Bonnell personally<br> responsible for permitting such a thing to happen.<br><br> ‘And the McLure girls have been called to Virginia,’ said Mrs.<br> Elsing in her die-away voice, fanning herself languidly as if<br> neither this nor anything else mattered very much. ‘Dallas McLure<br> is wounded.’<br><br> ‘How dreadful!’ chorused their hostesses. ‘Is poor Dallas--’<br><br> ‘No. Just through the shoulder,’ said Mrs. Merriwether briskly.<br> ‘But it couldn't possibly have happened at a worse time. The<br> girls are going North to bring him home. But, skies above, we<br> haven't time to sit here talking. We must hurry back to the<br> Armory and get the decorating done. Pitty, we need you and Melly<br> tonight to take Mrs. Bonnell's and the McLure girls' places.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but, Dolly, we can't go.’<br><br> ‘Don't say 'can't' to me, Pittypat Hamilton,’ said Mrs.<br> Merriwether vigorously. ‘We need you to watch the darkies with<br> the refreshments. That was what Mrs. Bonnell was to do. And<br> Melly, you must take the McLure girls' booth.’<br><br> ‘Oh, we just couldn't--with poor Charlie dead only a--’<br><br> ‘I know how you feel but there isn't any sacrifice too great for<br> the Cause,’ broke in Mrs. Elsing in a soft voice that settled<br> matters.<br><br> ‘Oh, we'd love to help but--why can't you get some sweet pretty<br> girls to take the booths?’<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether snorted a trumpeting snort.<br><br> ‘I don't know what's come over the young people these days. They<br> have no sense of responsibility. All the girls who haven't<br> already taken booths have more excuses than you could shake a<br> stick at. Oh, they don't fool me! They just don't want to be<br> hampered in making up to the officers, that's all. And they're<br> afraid their new dresses won't show off behind booth counters. I<br> wish to goodness that blockade runner--what's his name?’<br><br> ‘Captain Butler,’ supplied Mrs. Elsing.<br><br> ‘I wish he'd bring in more hospital supplies and less hoop skirts<br> and lace. If I've had to look at one dress today I've had to look<br> at twenty dresses that he ran in. Captain Butler--I'm sick of the<br> name. Now, Pitty, I haven't time to argue. You must come.<br> Everybody will understand. Nobody will see you in the back room<br> anyway, and Melly won't be conspicuous. The poor McLure girls'<br> booth is way down at the end and not very pretty so nobody will<br> notice you.’<br><br> ‘I think we should go,’ said Scarlett, trying to curb her<br> eagerness and to keep her face earnest and simple. ‘It is the<br> least we can do for the hospital.’<br><br> Neither of the visiting ladies had even mentioned her name, and<br> they turned and looked sharply at her. Even in their extremity,<br> they had not considered asking a widow of scarcely a year to<br> appear at a social function. Scarlett bore their gaze with a<br> wide-eyed childlike expression.<br><br> ‘I think we should go and help to make it a success, all of us. I<br> think I should go in the booth with Melly because--well, I think<br> it would look better for us both to be there instead of just one.<br> Don't you think so, Melly?’<br><br> ‘Well,’ began Melly helplessly. The idea of appearing publicly at<br> a social gathering while in mourning was so unheard of she was<br> bewildered.<br><br> ‘Scarlett's right,’ said Mrs. Merriwether, observing signs of<br> weakening. She rose and jerked her hoops into place. ‘Both of<br> you--all of you must come. Now, Pitty, don't start your excuses<br> again. Just think how much the hospital needs money for new beds<br> and drugs. And I know Charlie would like you to help the Cause he<br> died for.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ said Pittypat, helpless as always in the presence of a<br> stronger personality, ‘if you think people will understand.’<br><br> ‘Too good to be true! Too good to be true!’ said Scarlett's joyful<br> heart as she slipped unobtrusively into the pink-and-yellow-draped<br> booth that was to have been the McLure girls'. Actually she was<br> at a party! After a year's seclusion, after crepe and hushed voices<br> and nearly going crazy with boredom, she was actually at a party,<br> the biggest party Atlanta had ever seen. And she could see people<br> and many lights and hear music and view for herself the lovely laces<br> and frocks and frills that the famous Captain Butler had run through<br> the blockade on his last trip.<br><br> She sank down on one of the little stools behind the counter of<br> the booth and looked up and down the long hall which, until this<br> afternoon, had been a bare and ugly drill room. How the ladies<br> must have worked today to bring it to its present beauty. It<br> looked lovely. Every candle and candlestick in Atlanta must be in<br> this hall tonight, she thought, silver ones with a dozen<br> sprangling arms, china ones with charming figurines clustering<br> their bases, old brass stands, erect and dignified, laden with<br> candles of all sizes and colors, smelling fragrantly of<br> bayberries, standing on the gun racks that ran the length of the<br> hall, on the long flower-decked tables, on booth counters, even on<br> the sills of the open windows where the draughts of warm summer<br> air were just strong enough to make them flare.<br><br> In the center of the hall the huge ugly lamp, hanging from the<br> ceiling by rusty chains, was completely transformed by twining ivy<br> and wild grapevines that were already withering from the heat.<br> The walls were banked with pine branches that gave out a spicy<br> smell, making the corners of the room into pretty bowers where the<br> chaperons and old ladies would sit. Long graceful ropes of ivy<br> and grapevine and smilax were hung everywhere, in looping festoons<br> on the walls, draped above the windows, twined in scallops all<br> over the brightly colored cheesecloth booths. And everywhere amid<br> the greenery, on flags and bunting, blazed the bright stars of the<br> Confederacy on their background of red and blue.<br><br> The raised platform for the musicians was especially artistic. It<br> was completely hidden from view by the banked greenery and starry<br> bunting and Scarlett knew that every potted and tubbed plant in<br> town was there, coleus, geranium, hydrangea, oleander, elephant<br> ear--even Mrs. Elsing's four treasured rubber plants, which were<br> given posts of honor at the four corners.<br><br> At the other end of the hall from the platform, the ladies had<br> eclipsed themselves. On this wall hung large pictures of<br> President Davis and Georgia's own ‘Little Alec’ Stephens, Vice-<br> President of the Confederacy. Above them was an enormous flag<br> and, beneath, on long tables was the loot of the gardens of the<br> town, ferns, banks of roses, crimson and yellow and white, proud<br> sheaths of golden gladioli, masses of varicolored nasturtiums,<br> tall stiff hollyhocks rearing deep maroon and creamy heads above<br> the other flowers. Among them, candles burned serenely like altar<br> fires. The two faces looked down on the scene, two faces as<br> different as could be possible in two men at the helm of so<br> momentous an undertaking: Davis with the flat cheeks and cold eyes<br> of an ascetic, his thin proud lips set firmly; Stephens with dark<br> burning eyes deep socketed in a face that had known nothing but<br> sickness and pain and had triumphed over them with humor and with<br> fire--two faces that were greatly loved.<br><br> The elderly ladies of the committee in whose hands rested the<br> responsibility for the whole bazaar rustled in as importantly as<br> full-rigged ships, hurried the belated young matrons and giggling<br> girls into their booths, and then swept through the doors into the<br> back rooms where the refreshments were being laid out. Aunt Pitty<br> panted out after them.<br><br> The musicians clambered upon their platform, black, grinning,<br> their fat cheeks already shining with perspiration, and began<br> tuning their fiddles and sawing and whanging with their bows in<br> anticipatory importance. Old Levi, Mrs. Merriwether's coachman,<br> who had led the orchestras for every bazaar, ball and wedding<br> since Atlanta was named Marthasville, rapped with his bow for<br> attention. Few except the ladies who were conducting the bazaar<br> had arrived yet, but all eyes turned toward him. Then the<br> fiddles, bull fiddles, accordions, banjos and knuckle-bones broke<br> into a slow rendition of ‘Lorena’--too slow for dancing, the<br> dancing would come later when the booths were emptied of their<br> wares. Scarlett felt her heart beat faster as the sweet<br> melancholy of the waltz came to her:<br><br> <br> ‘The years creep slowly by, Lorena!<br> The snow is on the grass again.<br> The sun's far down the sky, Lorena . . .’<br><br> <br> One-two-three, one-two-three, dip-sway--three, turn--two-three.<br> What a beautiful waltz! She extended her hands slightly, closed<br> her eyes and swayed with the sad haunting rhythm. There was<br> something about the tragic melody and Lorena's lost love that<br> mingled with her own excitement and brought a lump into her<br> throat.<br><br> Then, as if brought into being by the waltz music, sounds floated<br> in from the shadowy moonlit street below, the trample of horses'<br> hooves and the sound of carriage wheels, laughter on the warm<br> sweet air and the soft acrimony of negro voices raised in argument<br> over hitching places for the horses. There was confusion on the<br> stairs and light-hearted merriment, the mingling of girls' fresh<br> voices with the bass notes of their escorts, airy cries of<br> greeting and squeals of joy as girls recognized friends from whom<br> they had parted only that afternoon.<br><br> Suddenly the hall burst into life. It was full of girls, girls<br> who floated in butterfly bright dresses, hooped out enormously,<br> lace pantalets peeping from beneath; round little white shoulders<br> bare, and faintest traces of soft little bosoms showing above lace<br> flounces; lace shawls carelessly hanging from arms; fans spangled<br> and painted, fans of swan's-down and peacock feathers, dangling at<br> wrists by tiny velvet ribbons; girls with masses of golden curls<br> about their necks and fringed gold earbobs that tossed and danced<br> with their dancing curls. Laces and silks and braid and ribbons,<br> all blockade run, all the more precious and more proudly worn<br> because of it, finery flaunted with an added pride as an extra<br> affront to the Yankees.<br><br> Not all the flowers of the town were standing in tribute to the<br> leaders of the Confederacy. The smallest, the most fragrant<br> blossoms bedecked the girls. Tea roses tucked behind pink ears,<br> cape jessamine and bud roses in round little garlands over<br> cascades of side curls, blossoms thrust demurely into satin<br> sashes, flowers that before the night was over would find their<br> way into the breast pockets of gray uniforms as treasured<br> souvenirs.<br><br> There were so many uniforms in the crowd--so many uniforms on so<br> many men whom Scarlett knew, men she had met on hospital cots, on<br> the streets, at the drill ground. They were such resplendent<br> uniforms, brave with shining buttons and dazzling with twined gold<br> braid on cuffs and collars, the red and yellow and blue stripes on<br> the trousers, for the different branches of the service, setting<br> off the gray to perfection. Scarlet and gold sashes swung to and<br> fro, sabers glittered and banged against shining boots, spurs<br> rattled and jingled.<br><br> Such handsome men, thought Scarlett, with a swell of pride in her<br> heart, as the men called greetings, waved to friends, bent low<br> over the hands of elderly ladies. All of them were so young<br> looking, even with their sweeping yellow mustaches and full black<br> and brown beards, so handsome, so reckless, with their arms in<br> slings, with head bandages startlingly white across sun-browned<br> faces. Some of them were on crutches and how proud were the girls<br> who solicitously slowed their steps to their escorts' hopping<br> pace! There was one gaudy splash of color among the uniforms that<br> put the girls' bright finery to shame and stood out in the crowd<br> like a tropical bird--a Louisiana Zouave, with baggy blue and<br> white striped pants, cream gaiters and tight little red jacket, a<br> dark, grinning little monkey of a man, with his arm in a black<br> silk sling. He was Maybelle Merriwether's especial beau, Rene<br> Picard. The whole hospital must have turned out, at least<br> everybody who could walk, and all the men on furlough and sick<br> leave and all the railroad and mail service and hospital and<br> commissary departments between here and Macon. How pleased the<br> ladies would be! The hospital should make a mint of money<br> tonight.<br><br> There was a ruffle of drums from the street below, the tramp of<br> feet, the admiring cries of coachmen. A bugle blared and a bass<br> voice shouted the command to break ranks. In a moment, the Home<br> Guard and the militia unit in their bright uniforms shook the<br> narrow stairs and crowded into the room, bowing, saluting, shaking<br> hands. There were boys in the Home Guard, proud to be playing at<br> war, promising themselves they would be in Virginia this time next<br> year, if the war would just last that long; old men with white<br> beards, wishing they were younger, proud to march in uniform in<br> the reflected glory of sons at the front. In the militia, there<br> were many middle-aged men and some older men but there was a fair<br> sprinkling of men of military age who did not carry themselves<br> quite so jauntily as their elders or their juniors. Already<br> people were beginning to whisper, asking why they were not with<br> Lee.<br><br> How would they all get into the hall! It had seemed such a large<br> place a few minutes before, and now it was packed, warm with<br> summer-night odors of sachet and cologne water and hair pomade and<br> burning bayberry candles, fragrant with flowers, faintly dusty as<br> many feet trod the old drill floors. The din and hubbub of voices<br> made it almost impossible to hear anything and, as if feeling the<br> joy and excitement of the occasion, old Levi choked off ‘Lorena’<br> in mid-bar, rapped sharply with his bow and, sawing away for dear<br> life, the orchestra burst into ‘Bonnie Blue Flag.’<br><br> A hundred voices took it up, sang it, shouted it like a cheer.<br> The Home Guard bugler, climbing onto the platform, caught up with<br> the music just as the chorus began, and the high silver notes<br> soared out thrillingly above the massed singing, causing goose<br> bumps to break out on bare arms and cold chills of deeply felt<br> emotion to fly down spines:<br><br> <br> ‘Hurrah! Hurrah! For the Southern Rights, hurrah!<br> Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag<br> That bears a single star!’<br><br> <br> They crashed into the second verse and Scarlett, singing with the<br> rest, heard the high sweet soprano of Melanie mounting behind her,<br> clear and true and thrilling as the bugle notes. Turning, she saw<br> that Melly was standing with her hands clasped to her breast, her<br> eyes closed, and tiny tears oozing from the corners. She smiled<br> at Scarlett, whimsically, as the music ended, making a little moue<br> of apology as she dabbed with her handkerchief.<br><br> ‘I'm so happy,’ she whispered, ‘and so proud of the soldiers that<br> I just can't help crying about it.’<br><br> There was a deep, almost fanatic glow in her eyes that for a<br> moment lit up her plain little face and made it beautiful.<br><br> The same look was on the faces of all the women as the song ended,<br> tears of pride on cheeks, pink or wrinkled, smiles on lips, a deep<br> hot glow in eyes, as they turned to their men, sweetheart to<br> lover, mother to son, wife to husband. They were all beautiful<br> with the blinding beauty that transfigures even the plainest woman<br> when she is utterly protected and utterly loved and is giving back<br> that love a thousandfold.<br><br> They loved their men, they believed in them, they trusted them to<br> the last breaths of their bodies. How could disaster ever come to<br> women such as they when their stalwart gray line stood between<br> them and the Yankees? Had there ever been such men as these since<br> the first dawn of the world, so heroic, so reckless, so gallant,<br> so tender? How could anything but overwhelming victory come to a<br> Cause as just and right as theirs? A Cause they loved as much as<br> they loved their men, a Cause they served with their hands and<br> their hearts, a Cause they talked about, thought about, dreamed<br> about--a Cause to which they would sacrifice these men if need be,<br> and bear their loss as proudly as the men bore their battle flags.<br><br> It was high tide of devotion and pride in their hearts, high tide<br> of the Confederacy, for final victory was at hand. Stonewall<br> Jackson's triumphs in the Valley and the defeat of the Yankees in<br> the Seven Days' Battle around Richmond showed that clearly. How<br> could it be otherwise with such leaders as Lee and Jackson? One<br> more victory and the Yankees would be on their knees yelling for<br> peace and the men would be riding home and there would be kissing<br> and laughter. One more victory and the war was over!<br><br> Of course, there were empty chairs and babies who would never see<br> their fathers' faces and unmarked graves by lonely Virginia creeks<br> and in the still mountains of Tennessee, but was that too great a<br> price to pay for such a Cause? Silks for the ladies and tea and<br> sugar were hard to get, but that was something to joke about.<br> Besides, the dashing blockade runners were bringing in these very<br> things under the Yankees' disgruntled noses, and that made the<br> possession of them many times more thrilling. Soon Raphael Semmes<br> and the Confederate Navy would tend to those Yankee gunboats and<br> the ports would be wide open. And England was coming in to help<br> the Confederacy win the war, because the English mills were<br> standing idle for want of Southern cotton. And naturally the<br> British aristocracy sympathized with the Confederacy, as one<br> aristocrat with another, against a race of dollar lovers like the<br> Yankees.<br><br> So the women swished their silks and laughed and, looking on their<br> men with hearts bursting with pride, they knew that love snatched<br> in the face of danger and death was doubly sweet for the strange<br> excitement that went with it.<br><br> When first she looked at the crowd, Scarlett's heart had thump-<br> thumped with the unaccustomed excitement of being at a party, but<br> as she half-comprehendingly saw the high-hearted look on the faces<br> about her, her joy began to evaporate. Every woman present was<br> blazing with an emotion she did not feel. It bewildered and<br> depressed her. Somehow, the ball did not seem so pretty nor the<br> girls so dashing, and the white heat of devotion to the Cause that<br> was still shining on every face seemed--why, it just seemed silly!<br><br> In a sudden flash of self-knowledge that made her mouth pop open<br> with astonishment, she realized that she did not share with these<br> women their fierce pride, their desire to sacrifice themselves and<br> everything they had for the Cause. Before horror made her think:<br> ‘No--no! I mustn't think such things! They're wrong--sinful,’<br> she knew the Cause meant nothing at all to her and that she was<br> bored with hearing other people talk about it with that fanatic<br> look in their eyes. The Cause didn't seem sacred to her. The war<br> didn't seem to be a holy affair, but a nuisance that killed men<br> senselessly and cost money and made luxuries hard to get. She saw<br> that she was tired of the endless knitting and the endless bandage<br> rolling and lint picking that roughened the cuticle of her nails.<br> And oh, she was so tired of the hospital! Tired and bored and<br> nauseated with the sickening gangrene smells and the endless<br> moaning, frightened by the look that coming death gave to sunken<br> faces.<br><br> She looked furtively around her, as the treacherous, blasphemous<br> thoughts rushed through her mind, fearful that someone might find<br> them written clearly upon her face. Oh, why couldn't she feel<br> like those other women! They were whole hearted and sincere in<br> their devotion to the Cause. They really meant everything they<br> said and did. And if anyone should ever suspect that she-- No,<br> no one must ever know! She must go on making a pretense of<br> enthusiasm and pride in the Cause which she could not feel, acting<br> out her part of the widow of a Confederate officer who bears her<br> grief bravely, whose heart is in the grave, who feels that her<br> husband's death meant nothing if it aided the Cause to triumph.<br><br> Oh, why was she different, apart from these loving women? She<br> could never love anything or anyone so selflessly as they did.<br> What a lonely feeling it was--and she had never been lonely either<br> in body or spirit before. At first she tried to stifle the<br> thoughts, but the hard self-honesty that lay at the base of her<br> nature would not permit it. And so, while the bazaar went on,<br> while she and Melanie waited on the customers who came to their<br> booth, her mind was busily working, trying to justify herself to<br> herself--a task which she seldom found difficult.<br><br> The other women were simply silly and hysterical with their talk<br> of patriotism and the Cause, and the men were almost as bad with<br> their talk of vital issues and States' Rights. She, Scarlett<br> O'Hara Hamilton, alone had good hard-headed Irish sense. She<br> wasn't going to make a fool out of herself about the Cause, but<br> neither was she going to make a fool out of herself by admitting<br> her true feelings. She was hard-headed enough to be practical<br> about the situation, and no one would ever know how she felt. How<br> surprised the bazaar would be if they knew what she really was<br> thinking! How shocked if she suddenly climbed on the bandstand<br> and declared that she thought the war ought to stop, so everybody<br> could go home and tend to their cotton and there could be parties<br> and beaux again and plenty of pale green dresses.<br><br> For a moment, her self-justification buoyed her up but still she<br> looked about the hall with distaste. The McLure girls' booth was<br> inconspicuous, as Mrs. Merriwether had said, and there were long<br> intervals when no one came to their corner and Scarlett had<br> nothing to do but look enviously on the happy throng. Melanie<br> sensed her moodiness but, crediting it to longing for Charlie, did<br> not try to engage her in conversation. She busied herself<br> arranging the articles in the booth in more attractive display,<br> while Scarlett sat and looked glumly around the room. Even the<br> banked flowers below the pictures of Mr. Davis and Mr. Stephens<br> displeased her.<br><br> ‘It looks like an altar,’ she sniffed. ‘And the way they all<br> carry on about those two, they might as well be the Father and the<br> Son!’ Then smitten with sudden fright at her irreverence she<br> began hastily to cross herself by way of apology but caught<br> herself in time.<br><br> ‘Well, it's true,’ she argued with her conscience. ‘Everybody<br> carries on like they were holy and they aren't anything but men,<br> and mighty unattractive looking ones at that.’<br><br> Of course, Mr. Stephens couldn't help how he looked for he had<br> been an invalid all his life, but Mr. Davis-- She looked up at<br> the cameo clean, proud face. It was his goatee that annoyed her<br> the most. Men should either be clean shaven, mustached or wear<br> full beards.<br><br> ‘That little wisp looks like it was just the best he could do,’<br> she thought, not seeing in his face the cold hard intelligence<br> that was carrying the weight of a new nation.<br><br> No, she was not happy now, and at first she had been radiant with<br> the pleasure of being in a crowd. Now just being present was not<br> enough. She was at the bazaar but not a part of it. No one paid<br> her any attention and she was the only young unmarried woman<br> present who did not have a beau. And all her life she had enjoyed<br> the center of the stage. It wasn't fair! She was seventeen years<br> old and her feet were patting the floor, wanting to skip and<br> dance. She was seventeen years old and she had a husband lying at<br> Oakland Cemetery and a baby in his cradle at Aunt Pittypat's and<br> everyone thought she should be content with her lot. She had a<br> whiter bosom and a smaller waist and a tinier foot than any girl<br> present, but for all they mattered she might just as well be lying<br> beside Charles with ‘Beloved Wife of’ carved over her.<br><br> She wasn't a girl who could dance and flirt and she wasn't a wife<br> who could sit with other wives and criticize the dancing and<br> flirting girls. And she wasn't old enough to be a widow. Widows<br> should be old--so terribly old they didn't want to dance and flirt<br> and be admired. Oh, it wasn't fair that she should have to sit<br> here primly and be the acme of widowed dignity and propriety when<br> she was only seventeen. It wasn't fair that she must keep her<br> voice low and her eyes cast modestly down, when men, attractive<br> ones, too, came to their booth.<br><br> Every girl in Atlanta was three deep in men. Even the plainest<br> girls were carrying on like belles--and, oh, worst of all, they<br> were carrying on in such lovely, lovely dresses!<br><br> Here she sat like a crow with hot black taffeta to her wrists and<br> buttoned up to her chin, with not even a hint of lace or braid,<br> not a jewel except Ellen's onyx mourning brooch, watching tacky-<br> looking girls hanging on the arms of good-looking men. All<br> because Charles Hamilton had had the measles. He didn't even die<br> in a fine glow of gallantry in battle, so she could brag about<br> him.<br><br> Rebelliously she leaned her elbows on the counter and looked at<br> the crowd, flouting Mammy's oft-repeated admonition against<br> leaning on elbows and making them ugly and wrinkled. What did it<br> matter if they did get ugly? She'd probably never get a chance to<br> show them again. She looked hungrily at the frocks floating by,<br> butter-yellow watered silks with garlands of rosebuds; pink satins<br> with eighteen flounces edged with tiny black velvet ribbons; baby<br> blue taffeta, ten yards in the skirt and foamy with cascading<br> lace; exposed bosoms; seductive flowers. Maybelle Merriwether<br> went toward the next booth on the arm of the Zouave, in an apple-<br> green tarlatan so wide that it reduced her waist to nothingness.<br> It was showered and flounced with cream-colored Chantilly lace<br> that had come from Charleston on the last blockader, and Maybelle<br> was flaunting it as saucily as if she and not the famous Captain<br> Butler had run the blockade.<br><br> ‘How sweet I'd look in that dress,’ thought Scarlett, a savage<br> envy in her heart. ‘Her waist is as big as a cow's. That green<br> is just my color and it would make my eyes look-- Why will<br> blondes try to wear that color? Her skin looks as green as an old<br> cheese. And to think I'll never wear that color again, not even<br> when I do get out of mourning. No, not even if I do manage to get<br> married again. Then I'll have to wear tacky old grays and tans<br> and lilacs.’<br><br> For a brief moment she considered the unfairness of it all. How<br> short was the time for fun, for pretty clothes, for dancing, for<br> coquetting! Only a few, too few years! Then you married and wore<br> dull-colored dresses and had babies that ruined your waist line<br> and sat in corners at dances with other sober matrons and only<br> emerged to dance with your husband or with old gentlemen who<br> stepped on your feet. If you didn't do these things, the other<br> matrons talked about you and then your reputation was ruined and<br> your family disgraced. It seemed such a terrible waste to spend<br> all your little girlhood learning how to be attractive and how to<br> catch men and then only use the knowledge for a year or two. When<br> she considered her training at the hands of Ellen and Mammy, she<br> knew it had been thorough and good because it had always reaped<br> results. There were set rules to be followed, and if you followed<br> them success crowned your efforts.<br><br> With old ladies you were sweet and guileless and appeared as<br> simple minded as possible, for old ladies were sharp and they<br> watched girls as jealously as cats, ready to pounce on any<br> indiscretion of tongue or eye. With old gentlemen, a girl was<br> pert and saucy and almost, but not quite, flirtatious, so that the<br> old fools' vanities would be tickled. It made them feel devilish<br> and young and they pinched your cheek and declared you were a<br> minx. And, of course, you always blushed on such occasions,<br> otherwise they would pinch you with more pleasure than was proper<br> and then tell their sons that you were fast.<br><br> With young girls and young married women, you slopped over with<br> sugar and kissed them every time you met them, even if it was ten<br> times a day. And you put your arms about their waists and<br> suffered them to do the same to you, no matter how much you<br> disliked it. You admired their frocks or their babies<br> indiscriminately and teased about beaux and complimented husbands<br> and giggled modestly and denied that you had any charms at all<br> compared with theirs. And, above all, you never said what you<br> really thought about anything, any more than they said what they<br> really thought.<br><br> Other women's husbands you let severely alone, even if they were<br> your own discarded beaux, and no matter how temptingly attractive<br> they were. If you were too nice to young husbands, their wives<br> said you were fast and you got a bad reputation and never caught<br> any beaux of your own.<br><br> But with young bachelors--ah, that was a different matter! You<br> could laugh softly at them and when they came flying to see why<br> you laughed, you could refuse to tell them and laugh harder and<br> keep them around indefinitely trying to find out. You could<br> promise, with your eyes, any number of exciting things that would<br> make a man maneuver to get you alone. And, having gotten you<br> alone, you could be very, very hurt or very, very angry when he<br> tried to kiss you. You could make him apologize for being a cur<br> and forgive him so sweetly that he would hang around trying to<br> kiss you a second time. Sometimes, but not often, you did let him<br> kiss you. (Ellen and Mammy had not taught her that but she<br> learned it was effective.) Then you cried and declared you didn't<br> know what had come over you and that he couldn't ever respect you<br> again. Then he had to dry your eyes and usually he proposed, to<br> show just how much he did respect you. And then there were-- Oh,<br> there were so many things to do to bachelors and she knew them<br> all, the nuance of the sidelong glance, the half-smile behind the<br> fan, the swaying of the hips so that skirts swung like a bell, the<br> tears, the laughter, the flattery, the sweet sympathy. Oh, all<br> the tricks that never failed to work--except with Ashley.<br><br> No, it didn't seem right to learn all these smart tricks, use them<br> so briefly and then put them away forever. How wonderful it would<br> be never to marry but to go on being lovely in pale green dresses<br> and forever courted by handsome men. But, if you went on too<br> long, you got to be an old maid like India Wilkes and everyone<br> said ‘poor thing’ in that smug hateful way. No, after all it was<br> better to marry and keep your self-respect even if you never had<br> any more fun.<br><br> Oh, what a mess life was! Why had she been such an idiot as to<br> marry Charles of all people and have her life end at sixteen?<br><br> Her indignant and hopeless reverie was broken when the crowd began<br> pushing back against the walls, the ladies carefully holding their<br> hoops so that no careless contact should turn them up against<br> their bodies and show more pantalets than was proper. Scarlett<br> tiptoed above the crowd and saw the captain of the militia<br> mounting the orchestra platform. He shouted orders and half of<br> the Company fell into line. For a few minutes they went through a<br> brisk drill that brought perspiration to their foreheads and<br> cheers and applause from the audience. Scarlett clapped her hands<br> dutifully with the rest and, as the soldiers pushed forward toward<br> the punch and lemonade booths after they were dismissed, she<br> turned to Melanie, feeling that she had better begin her deception<br> about the Cause as soon as possible.<br><br> ‘They looked fine, didn't they?’ she said.<br><br> Melanie was fussing about with the knitted things on the counter.<br><br> ‘Most of them would look a lot finer in gray uniforms and in<br> Virginia,’ she said, and she did not trouble to lower her voice.<br><br> Several of the proud mothers of members of the militia were<br> standing close by and overheard the remark. Mrs. Guinan turned<br> scarlet and then white, for her twenty-five-year-old Willie was in<br> the company.<br><br> Scarlett was aghast at such words coming from Melly of all people.<br><br> ‘Why, Melly!’<br><br> ‘You know it's true, Scarlet. I don't mean the little boys and<br> the old gentlemen. But a lot of the militia are perfectly able to<br> tote a rifle and that's what they ought to be doing this minute.’<br><br> ‘But--but--’ began Scarlett, who had never considered the matter<br> before. ‘Somebody's got to stay home to--’ What was it Willie<br> Guinan had told her by way of excusing his presence in Atlanta?<br> ‘Somebody's got to stay home to protect the state from invasion.’<br><br> ‘Nobody's invading us and nobody's going to,’ said Melly coolly,<br> looking toward a group of the militia. ‘And the best way to keep<br> out invaders is to go to Virginia and beat the Yankees there. And<br> as for all this talk about the militia staying here to keep the<br> darkies from rising--why, it's the silliest thing I ever heard of.<br> Why should our people rise? It's just a good excuse for cowards.<br> I'll bet we could lick the Yankees in a month if all the militia<br> of all the states went to Virginia. So there!’<br><br> ‘Why, Melly!’ cried Scarlett again, staring.<br><br> Melly's soft dark eyes were flashing angrily. ‘My husband wasn't<br> afraid to go and neither was yours. And I'd rather they'd both be<br> dead than here at home-- Oh, darling, I'm sorry. How thoughtless<br> and cruel of me!’<br><br> She stroked Scarlett's arm appealingly and Scarlett stared at her.<br> But it was not of dead Charles she was thinking. It was of<br> Ashley. Suppose he too were to die? She turned quickly and<br> smiled automatically as Dr. Meade walked up to their booth.<br><br> ‘Well, girls,’ he greeted them, ‘it was nice of you to come. I<br> know what a sacrifice it must have been for you to come out<br> tonight. But it's all for the Cause. And I'm going to tell you a<br> secret. I've a surprise way for making some more money tonight<br> for the hospital, but I'm afraid some of the ladies are going to<br> be shocked about it.’<br><br> He stopped and chuckled as he tugged at his gray goatee.<br><br> ‘Oh, what? Do tell!’<br><br> ‘On second thought I believe I'll keep you guessing, too. But you<br> girls must stand up for me if the church members want to run me<br> out of town for doing it. However, it's for the hospital. You'll<br> see. Nothing like this has ever been done before.’<br><br> He went off pompously toward a group of chaperons in one corner,<br> and just as the two girls had turned to each other to discuss the<br> possibilities of the secret, two old gentlemen bore down on the<br> booth, declaring in loud voices that they wanted ten miles of<br> tatting. Well, after all, old gentlemen were better than no<br> gentlemen at all, thought Scarlett, measuring out the tatting and<br> submitting demurely to being chucked under the chin. The old<br> blades charged off toward the lemonade booth and others took their<br> places at the counter. Their booth did not have so many customers<br> as did the other booths where the tootling laugh of Maybelle<br> Merriwether sounded and Fanny Elsing's giggles and the Whiting<br> girls' repartee made merriment. Melly sold useless stuff to men<br> who could have no possible use for it as quietly and serenely as a<br> shopkeeper, and Scarlett patterned her conduct on Melly's.<br><br> There were crowds in front of every other counter but theirs,<br> girls chattering, men buying. The few who came to them talked<br> about how they went to the university with Ashley and what a fine<br> soldier he was or spoke in respectful tones of Charles and how<br> great a loss to Atlanta his death had been.<br><br> Then the music broke into the rollicking strains of ‘Johnny<br> Booker, he'p dis Nigger!’ and Scarlett thought she would scream.<br> She wanted to dance. She wanted to dance. She looked across the<br> floor and tapped her foot to the music and her green eyes blazed<br> so eagerly that they fairly snapped. All the way across the<br> floor, a man, newly come and standing in the doorway, saw them,<br> started in recognition and watched closely the slanting eyes in<br> the sulky, rebellious face. Then he grinned to himself as he<br> recognized the invitation that any male could read.<br><br> He was dressed in black broadcloth, a tall man, towering over the<br> officers who stood near him, bulky in the shoulders but tapering<br> to a small waist and absurdly small feet in varnished boots. His<br> severe black suit, with fine ruffled shirt and trousers smartly<br> strapped beneath high insteps, was oddly at variance with his<br> physique and face, for he was foppishly groomed, the clothes of a<br> dandy on a body that was powerful and latently dangerous in its<br> lazy grace. His hair was jet black, and his black mustache was<br> small and closely clipped, almost foreign looking compared with<br> the dashing, swooping mustaches of the cavalrymen near by. He<br> looked, and was, a man of lusty and unashamed appetites. He had<br> an air of utter assurance, of displeasing insolence about him, and<br> there was a twinkle of malice in his bold eyes as he stared at<br> Scarlett, until finally, feeling his gaze, she looked toward him.<br><br> Somewhere in her mind, the bell of recognition rang, but for the<br> moment she could not recall who he was. But he was the first man<br> in months who had displayed an interest in her, and she threw him<br> a gay smile. She made a little curtsy as he bowed, and then, as<br> he straightened and started toward her with a peculiarly lithe<br> Indian-like gait, her hand went to her mouth in horror, for she<br> knew who he was.<br><br> Thunderstruck, she stood as if paralyzed while he made his way<br> through the crowd. Then she turned blindly, bent on flight into<br> the refreshment rooms, but her skirt caught on a nail of the<br> booth. She jerked furiously at it, tearing it and, in an instant,<br> he was beside her.<br><br> ‘Permit me,’ he said bending over and disentangling the flounce.<br> ‘I hardly hoped that you would recall me, Miss O'Hara.’<br><br> His voice was oddly pleasant to the ear, the well-modulated voice<br> of a gentleman, resonant and overlaid with the flat slow drawl of<br> the Charlestonian.<br><br> She looked up at him imploringly, her face crimson with the shame<br> of their last meeting, and met two of the blackest eyes she had<br> ever seen, dancing in merciless merriment. Of all the people in<br> the world to turn up here, this terrible person who had witnessed<br> that scene with Ashley which still gave her nightmares; this<br> odious wretch who ruined girls and was not received by nice<br> people; this despicable man who had said, and with good cause,<br> that she was not a lady.<br><br> At the sound of his voice, Melanie turned and for the first time<br> in her life Scarlett thanked God for the existence of her sister-<br> in-law.<br><br> ‘Why--it's--it's Mr. Rhett Butler, isn't it?’ said Melanie with a<br> little smile, putting out her hand. ‘I met you--’<br><br> ‘On the happy occasion of the announcement of your betrothal,’ he<br> finished, bending over her hand. ‘It is kind of you to recall<br> me.’<br><br> ‘And what are you doing so far from Charleston, Mr. Butler?’<br><br> ‘A boring matter of business, Mrs. Wilkes. I will be in and out<br> of your town from now on. I find I must not only bring in goods<br> but see to the disposal of them.’<br><br> ‘Bring in--’ began Melly, her brow wrinkling, and then she broke<br> into a delighted smile. ‘Why, you--you must be the famous Captain<br> Butler we've been hearing so much about--the blockade runner.<br> Why, every girl here is wearing dresses you brought in. Scarlett,<br> aren't you thrilled--what's the matter, dear? Are you faint? Do<br> sit down.’<br><br> Scarlett sank to the stool, her breath coming so rapidly she<br> feared the lacings of her stays would burst. Oh, what a terrible<br> thing to happen! She had never thought to meet this man again.<br> He picked up her black fan from the counter and began fanning her<br> solicitously, too solicitously, his face grave but his eyes still<br> dancing.<br><br> ‘It is quite warm in here,’ he said. ‘No wonder Miss O'Hara is<br> faint. May I lead you to a window?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Scarlett, so rudely that Melly stared.<br><br> ‘She is not Miss O'Hara any longer,’ said Melly. ‘She is Mrs.<br> Hamilton. She is my sister now,’ and Melly bestowed one of her<br> fond little glances on her. Scarlett felt that she would strangle<br> at the expression on Captain Butler's swarthy piratical face.<br><br> ‘I am sure that is a great gain to two charming ladies,’ said he,<br> making a slight bow. That was the kind of remark all men made,<br> but when he said it it seemed to her that he meant just the<br> opposite.<br><br> ‘Your husbands are here tonight, I trust, on this happy occasion?<br> It would be a pleasure to renew acquaintances.’<br><br> ‘My husband is in Virginia,’ said Melly with a proud lift of her<br> head. ‘But Charles--’ Her voice broke.<br><br> ‘He died in camp,’ said Scarlett flatly. She almost snapped the<br> words. Would this creature never go away? Melly looked at her,<br> startled, and the Captain made a gesture of self-reproach.<br><br> ‘My dear ladies--how could I! You must forgive me. But permit a<br> stranger to offer the comfort of saying that to die for one's<br> country is to live forever.’<br><br> Melanie smiled at him through sparkling tears while Scarlett felt<br> the fox of wrath and impotent hate gnaw at her vitals. Again he<br> had made a graceful remark, the kind of compliment any gentleman<br> would pay under such circumstances, but he did not mean a word of<br> it. He was jeering at her. He knew she hadn't loved Charles.<br> And Melly was just a big enough fool not to see through him. Oh,<br> please God, don't let anybody else see through him, she thought<br> with a start of terror. Would he tell what he knew? Of course he<br> wasn't a gentleman and there was no telling what men would do when<br> they weren't gentlemen. There was no standard to judge them by.<br> She looked up at him and saw that his mouth was pulled down at the<br> corners in mock sympathy, even while he swished the fan.<br> Something in his look challenged her spirit and brought her<br> strength back in a surge of dislike. Abruptly she snatched the<br> fan from his hand.<br><br> ‘I'm quite all right,’ she said tartly. ‘There's no need to blow<br> my hair out of place.’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, darling! Captain Butler, you must forgive her. She--<br> she isn't herself when she hears poor Charlie's name spoken--and<br> perhaps, after all, we shouldn't have come here tonight. We're<br> still in mourning, you see, and it's quite a strain on her--all<br> this gaiety and music, poor child.’<br><br> ‘I quite understand,’ he said with elaborate gravity, but as he<br> turned and gave Melanie a searching look that went to the bottom<br> of her sweet worried eyes, his expression changed, reluctant<br> respect and gentleness coming over his dark face. ‘I think you're<br> a courageous little lady, Mrs. Wilkes.’<br><br> ‘Not a word about me!’ thought Scarlett indignantly, as Melly<br> smiled in confusion and answered,<br><br> ‘Dear me, no, Captain Butler! The hospital committee just had to<br> have us for this booth because at the last minute-- A pillow<br> case? Here's a lovely one with a flag on it.’<br><br> She turned to three cavalrymen who appeared at her counter. For a<br> moment, Melanie thought how nice Captain Butler was. Then she<br> wished that something more substantial than cheesecloth was<br> between her skirt and the spittoon that stood just outside the<br> booth, for the aim of the horsemen with amber streams of tobacco<br> juice was not so unerring as with their long horse pistols. Then<br> she forgot about the Captain, Scarlett and the spittoons as more<br> customers crowded to her.<br><br> Scarlett sat quietly on the stool fanning herself, not daring to<br> look up, wishing Captain Butler back on the deck of his ship where<br> he belonged.<br><br> ‘Your husband has been dead long?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, a long time. Almost a year.’<br><br> ‘An aeon, I'm sure.’<br><br> Scarlett was not sure what an aeon was, but there was no mistaking<br> the baiting quality of his voice, so she said nothing.<br><br> ‘Had you been married long? Forgive my questions but I have been<br> away from this section for so long.’<br><br> ‘Two months,’ said Scarlett, unwillingly.<br><br> ‘A tragedy, no less,’ his easy voice continued.<br><br> Oh, damn him, she thought violently. If he was any other man in<br> the world I could simply freeze up and order him off. But he<br> knows about Ashley and he knows I didn't love Charlie. And my<br> hands are tied. She said nothing, still looking down at her fan.<br><br> ‘And this is your first social appearance?’<br><br> ‘I know it looks quite odd,’ she explained rapidly. ‘But the<br> McLure girls who were to take this booth were called away and<br> there was no one else, so Melanie and I--’<br><br> ‘No sacrifice is too great for the Cause.’<br><br> Why, that was what Mrs. Elsing had said, but when she said it it<br> didn't sound the same way. Hot words started to her lips but she<br> choked them back. After all, she was here, not for the Cause, but<br> because she was tired of sitting home.<br><br> ‘I have always thought,’ he said reflectively, ‘that the system of<br> mourning, of immuring women in crepe for the rest of their lives<br> and forbidding them normal enjoyment is just as barbarous as the<br> Hindu suttee.’<br><br> ‘Settee?’<br><br> He laughed and she blushed for her ignorance. She hated people<br> who used words unknown to her.<br><br> ‘In India, when a man dies he is burned, instead of buried, and<br> his wife always climbs on the funeral pyre and is burned with<br> him.’<br><br> ‘How dreadful! Why do they do it? Don't the police do anything<br> about it?’<br><br> ‘Of course not. A wife who didn't burn herself would be a social<br> outcast. All the worthy Hindu matrons would talk about her for<br> not behaving as a well-bred lady should--precisely as those worthy<br> matrons in the corner would talk about you, should you appear<br> tonight in a red dress and lead a reel. Personally, I think<br> suttee much more merciful than our charming Southern custom of<br> burying widows alive!’<br><br> ‘How dare you say I'm buried alive!’<br><br> ‘How closely women crutch the very chains that bind them! You<br> think the Hindu custom barbarous--but would you have had the<br> courage to appear here tonight if the Confederacy hadn't needed<br> you?’<br><br> Arguments of this character were always confusing to Scarlett.<br> His were doubly confusing because she had a vague idea there was<br> truth in them. But now was the time to squelch him.<br><br> ‘Of course, I wouldn't have come. It would have been--well,<br> disrespectful to--it would have seemed as if I hadn't lov--’<br><br> His eyes waited on her words, cynical amusement in them, and she<br> could not go on. He knew she hadn't loved Charlie and he wouldn't<br> let her pretend to the nice polite sentiments that she should<br> express. What a terrible, terrible thing it was to have to do<br> with a man who wasn't a gentleman. A gentleman always appeared to<br> believe a lady even when he knew she was lying. That was Southern<br> chivalry. A gentleman always obeyed the rules and said the<br> correct things and made life easier for a lady. But this man<br> seemed not to care for rules and evidently enjoyed talking of<br> things no one ever talked about.<br><br> ‘I am waiting breathlessly.’<br><br> ‘I think you are horrid,’ she said, helplessly, dropping her eyes.<br><br> He leaned down across the counter until his mouth was near her ear<br> and hissed, in a very creditable imitation of the stage villains<br> who appeared infrequently at the Athenaeum Hall: ‘Fear not, fair<br> lady! Your guilty secret is safe with me!’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she whispered, feverishly, ‘how can you say such things!’<br><br> ‘I only thought to ease your mind. What would you have me say?<br> 'Be mine, beautiful female, or I will reveal all?'‘<br><br> She met his eyes unwillingly and saw they were as teasing as a<br> small boy's. Suddenly she laughed. It was such a silly<br> situation, after all. He laughed too, and so loudly that several<br> of the chaperons in the corner looked their way. Observing how<br> good a time Charles Hamilton's widow appeared to be having with a<br> perfect stranger, they put their heads together disapprovingly.<br><br> <br><br> There was a roll of drums and many voices cried ‘Sh!’ as Dr. Meade<br> mounted the platform and spread out his arms for quiet.<br><br> ‘We must all give grateful thanks to the charming ladies whose<br> indefatigable and patriotic efforts have made this bazaar not only<br> a pecuniary success,’ he began, ‘but have transformed this rough<br> hall into a bower of loveliness, a fit garden for the charming<br> rosebuds I see about me.’<br><br> Everyone clapped approvingly.<br><br> ‘The ladies have given their best, not only of their time but of<br> the labor of their hands, and these beautiful objects in the<br> booths are doubly beautiful, made as they are by the fair hands of<br> our charming Southern women.’<br><br> There were more shouts of approval, and Rhett Butler who had been<br> lounging negligently against the counter at Scarlett's side<br> whispered: ‘Pompous goat, isn't he?’<br><br> Startled, at first horrified, at this lese majesty toward<br> Atlanta's most beloved citizen, she stared reprovingly at him.<br> But the doctor did look like a goat with his gray chin whiskers<br> wagging away at a great rate, and with difficulty she stifled a<br> giggle.<br><br> ‘But these things are not enough. The good ladies of the hospital<br> committee, whose cool hands have soothed many a suffering brow and<br> brought back from the jaws of death our brave men wounded in the<br> bravest of all Causes, know our needs. I will not enumerate them.<br> We must have more money to buy medical supplies from England, and<br> we have with us tonight the intrepid captain who has so<br> successfully run the blockade for a year and who will run it again<br> to bring us the drugs we need. Captain Rhett Butler!’<br><br> Though caught unawares, the blockader made a graceful bow--too<br> graceful, thought Scarlett, trying to analyze it. It was almost<br> as if he overdid his courtesy because his contempt for everybody<br> present was so great. There was a loud burst of applause as he<br> bowed and a craning of necks from the ladies in the corner. So<br> that was who poor Charles Hamilton's widow was carrying on with!<br> And Charlie hardly dead a year!<br><br> ‘We need more gold and I am asking you for it,’ the doctor<br> continued. ‘I am asking a sacrifice but a sacrifice so small<br> compared with the sacrifices our gallant men in gray are making<br> that it will seem laughably small. Ladies, I want your jewelry.<br> _I_ want your jewelry? No, the Confederacy wants your jewelry,<br> the Confederacy calls for it and I know no one will hold back.<br> How fair a gem gleams on a lovely wrist! How beautifully gold<br> brooches glitter on the bosoms of our patriotic women! But how<br> much more beautiful is sacrifice than all the gold and gems of the<br> Ind. The gold will be melted and the stones sold and the money<br> used to buy drugs and other medical supplies. Ladies, there will<br> pass among you two of our gallant wounded, with baskets and--’<br> But the rest of his speech was lost in the storm and tumult of<br> clapping hands and cheering voices.<br><br> Scarlett's first thought was one of deep thankfulness that<br> mourning forbade her wearing her precious earbobs and the heavy<br> gold chain that had been Grandma Robillard's and the gold and<br> black enameled bracelets and the garnet brooch. She saw the<br> little Zouave, a split-oak basket over his unwounded arm, making<br> the rounds of the crowd on her side of the hall and saw women, old<br> and young, laughing, eager, tugging at bracelets, squealing in<br> pretended pain as earrings came from pierced flesh, helping each<br> other undo stiff necklace clasps, unpinning brooches from bosoms.<br> There was a steady little clink-clink of metal on metal and cries<br> of ‘Wait--wait! I've got it unfastened now. There!’ Maybelle<br> Merriwether was pulling off her lovely twin bracelets from above<br> and below her elbows. Fanny Elsing, crying ‘Mamma, may I?’ was<br> tearing from her curls the seed-pearl ornament set in heavy gold<br> which had been in the family for generations. As each offering<br> went into the basket, there was applause and cheering.<br><br> The grinning little man was coming to their booth now, his basket<br> heavy on his arm, and as he passed Rhett Butler a handsome gold<br> cigar case was thrown carelessly into the basket. When he came to<br> Scarlett and rested his basket upon the counter, she shook her<br> head throwing wide her hands to show that she had nothing to give.<br> It was embarrassing to be the only person present who was giving<br> nothing. And then she saw the bright gleam of her wide gold<br> wedding ring.<br><br> For a confused moment she tried to remember Charles' face--how he<br> had looked when he slipped it on her finger. But the memory was<br> blurred, blurred by the sudden feeling of irritation that memory<br> of him always brought to her. Charles--he was the reason why life<br> was over for her, why she was an old woman.<br><br> With a sudden wrench she seized the ring but it stuck. The Zouave<br> was moving toward Melanie.<br><br> ‘Wait!’ cried Scarlett. ‘I have something for you!’ The ring<br> came off and, as she started to throw it into the basket, heaped<br> up with chains, watches, rings, pins and bracelets, she caught<br> Rhett Butler's eye. His lips were twisted in a slight smile.<br> Defiantly, she tossed the ring onto the top of the pile.<br><br> ‘Oh, my darling!’ whispered Molly, clutching her arm, her eyes<br> blazing with love and pride. ‘You brave, brave girl! Wait--<br> please, wait, Lieutenant Picard! I have something for you, too!’<br><br> She was tugging at her own wedding ring, the ring Scarlett knew<br> had never once left that finger since Ashley put it there.<br> Scarlett knew, as no one did, how much it meant to her. It came<br> off with difficulty and for a brief instant was clutched tightly<br> in the small palm. Then it was laid gently on the pile of<br> jewelry. The two girls stood looking after the Zouave who was<br> moving toward the group of elderly ladies in the corner, Scarlett<br> defiant, Melanie with a look more pitiful than tears. And neither<br> expression was lost on the man who stood beside them.<br><br> ‘If you hadn't been brave enough to do it, I would never have been<br> either,’ said Melly, putting her arm about Scarlett's waist and<br> giving her a gentle squeeze. For a moment Scarlett wanted to<br> shake her off and cry ‘Name of God!’ at the top of her lungs, as<br> Gerald did when he was irritated, but she caught Rhett Butler's<br> eye and managed a very sour smile. It was annoying the way Melly<br> always misconstrued her motives--but perhaps that was far<br> preferable to having her suspect the truth.<br><br> ‘What a beautiful gesture,’ said Rhett Butler, softly. ‘It is<br> such sacrifices as yours that hearten our brave lads in gray.’<br><br> Hot words bubbled to her lips and it was with difficulty that she<br> checked them. There was mockery in everything he said. She<br> disliked him heartily, lounging there against the booth. But<br> there was something stimulating about him, something warm and<br> vital and electric. All that was Irish in her rose to the<br> challenge of his black eyes. She decided she was going to take<br> this man down a notch or two. His knowledge of her secret gave<br> him an advantage over her that was exasperating, so she would have<br> to change that by putting him at a disadvantage somehow. She<br> stifled her impulse to tell him exactly what she thought of him.<br> Sugar always caught more flies than vinegar, as Mammy often said,<br> and she was going to catch and subdue this fly, so he could never<br> again have her at his mercy.<br><br> ‘Thank you,’ she said sweetly, deliberately misunderstanding his<br> jibe. ‘A compliment like that coming from so famous a man as<br> Captain Butler is appreciated.’<br><br> He threw back his head and laughed freely--yelped, was what<br> Scarlett thought fiercely, her face becoming pink again.<br><br> ‘Why don't you say what you really think?’ he demanded, lowering<br> his voice so that in the clatter and excitement of the collection,<br> it came only to her ears. ‘Why don't you say I'm a damned rascal<br> and no gentleman and that I must take myself off or you'll have<br> one of these gallant boys in gray call me out?’<br><br> It was on the tip of her tongue to answer tartly, but she managed<br> by heroic control to say: ‘Why, Captain Butler! How you do run<br> on! As if everybody didn't know how famous you are and how brave<br> and what a--what a--<br><br> ‘I am disappointed in you,’ he said.<br><br> ‘Disappointed?’<br><br> ‘Yes. On the occasion of our first eventful meeting I thought to<br> myself that I had at last met a girl who was not only beautiful<br> but who had courage. And now I see that you are only beautiful.’<br><br> ‘Do you mean to call me a coward?’ She was ruffling like a hen.<br><br> ‘Exactly. You lack the courage to say what you really think.<br> When I first met you, I thought: There is a girl in a million.<br> She isn't like these other silly little fools who believe<br> everything their mammas tell them and act on it, no matter how<br> they feel. And conceal all their feelings and desires and little<br> heartbreaks behind a lot of sweet words. I thought: Miss O'Hara<br> is a girl of rare spirit. She knows what she wants and she<br> doesn't mind speaking her mind--or throwing vases.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she said, rage breaking through. ‘Then I'll speak my mind<br> right this minute. If you'd had any raising at all you'd never<br> have come over here and talked to me. You'd have known I never<br> wanted to lay eyes on you again! But you aren't a gentleman! You<br> are just a nasty ill-bred creature! And you think that because<br> your rotten little boats can outrun the Yankees, you've the right<br> to come here and jeer at men who are brave and women who are<br> sacrificing everything for the Cause--’<br><br> ‘Stop, stop--’ he begged with a grin. ‘You started off very<br> nicely and said what you thought, but don't begin talking to me<br> about the Cause. I'm tired of hearing about it and I'll bet you<br> are, too--’<br><br> ‘Why, how did--’ she began, caught off her balance, and then<br> checked herself hastily, boiling with anger at herself for falling<br> into his trap.<br><br> ‘I stood there in the doorway before you saw me and I watched<br> you,’ he said. ‘And I watched the other girls. And they all<br> looked as though their faces came out of one mold. Yours didn't.<br> You have an easy face to read. You didn't have your mind on your<br> business and I'll wager you weren't thinking about our Cause or<br> the hospital. It was all over your face that you wanted to dance<br> and have a good time and you couldn't. So you were mad clean<br> through. Tell the truth. Am I not right?’<br><br> ‘I have nothing more to say to you, Captain Butler,’ she said as<br> formally as she could, trying to draw the rags of her dignity<br> about her. ‘Just because you're conceited at being the 'great<br> blockader' doesn't give you the right to insult women.’<br><br> ‘The great blockader! That's a joke. Pray give me only one<br> moment more of your precious time before you cast me into<br> darkness. I wouldn't want so charming a little patriot to be left<br> under a misapprehension about my contribution to the Confederate<br> Cause.’<br><br> ‘I don't care to listen to your brags.’<br><br> ‘Blockading is a business with me and I'm making money out of it.<br> When I stop making money out of it, I'll quit. What do you think<br> of that?’<br><br> ‘I think you're a mercenary rascal--just like the Yankees.’<br><br> ‘Exactly,’ he grinned. ‘And the Yankees help me make my money.<br> Why, last month I sailed my boat right into New York harbor and<br> took on a cargo.’<br><br> ‘What!’ cried Scarlett, interested and excited in spite of<br> herself. ‘Didn't they shell you?’<br><br> ‘My poor innocent! Of course not. There are plenty of sturdy<br> Union patriots who are not averse to picking up money selling<br> goods to the Confederacy. I run my boat into New York, buy from<br> Yankee firms, sub rosa, of course, and away I go. And when that<br> gets a bit dangerous, I go to Nassau where these same Union<br> patriots have brought powder and shells and hoop skirts for me.<br> It's more convenient than going to England. Sometimes it's a bit<br> difficult running it into Charleston or Wilmington--but you'd be<br> surprised how far a little gold goes.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I knew Yankees were vile but I didn't know--’<br><br> ‘Why quibble about the Yankees earning an honest penny selling out<br> the Union? It won't matter in a hundred years. The result will<br> be the same. They know the Confederacy will be licked eventually,<br> so why shouldn't they cash in on it?’<br><br> ‘Licked--us?’<br><br> ‘Of course.’<br><br> ‘Will you please leave me--or will it be necessary for me to call<br> my carriage and go home to get rid of you?’<br><br> ‘A red-hot little Rebel,’ he said, with another sudden grin. He<br> bowed and sauntered off, leaving her with her bosom heaving with<br> impotent rage and indignation. There was disappointment burning<br> in her that she could not quite analyze, the disappointment of a<br> child seeing illusions crumble. How dared he take the glamor from<br> the blockaders! And how dared he say the Confederacy would be<br> licked! He should be shot for that--shot like a traitor. She<br> looked about the hall at the familiar faces, so assured of<br> success, so brave, so devoted, and somehow a cold little chill set<br> in at her heart. Licked? These people--why, of course not! The<br> very idea was impossible, disloyal.<br><br> ‘What were you two whispering about?’ asked Melanie, turning to<br> Scarlett as her customers drifted off. ‘I couldn't help seeing<br> that Mrs. Merriwether had her eye on you all the time and, dear,<br> you know how she talks.’<br><br> ‘Oh, the man's impossible--an ill-bred boor,’ said Scarlett. ‘And<br> as for old lady Merriwether, let her talk. I'm sick of acting<br> like a ninny, just for her benefit.’<br><br> ‘Why, Scarlett!’ cried Melanie, scandalized.<br><br> ‘Sh-sh,’ said Scarlett. ‘Dr. Meade is going to make another<br> announcement.’<br><br> The gathering quieted again as the doctor raised his voice, at<br> first in thanks to the ladies who had so willingly given their<br> jewelry.<br><br> ‘And now, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to propose a surprise--<br> an innovation that may shock some of you, but I ask you to<br> remember that all this is done for the hospital and for the<br> benefit of our boys lying there.’<br><br> Everyone edged forward, in anticipation, trying to imagine what<br> the sedate doctor could propose that would be shocking.<br><br> ‘The dancing is about to begin and the first number will, of<br> course, be a reel, followed by a waltz. The dances following, the<br> polkas, the schottisches, the mazurkas, will be preceded by short<br> reels. I know the gentle rivalry to lead the reels very well and<br> so--’ The doctor mopped his brow and cast a quizzical glance at<br> the corner, where his wife sat among the chaperons. ‘Gentlemen,<br> if you wish to lead a reel with the lady of your choice, you must<br> bargain for her. I will be auctioneer and the proceeds will go to<br> the hospital.’<br><br> Fans stopped in mid-swish and a ripple of excited murmuring ran<br> through the hall. The chaperons' corner was in tumult and Mrs.<br> Meade, anxious to support her husband in an action of which she<br> heartily disapproved, was at a disadvantage. Mrs. Elsing, Mrs.<br> Merriwether and Mrs. Whiting were red with indignation. But<br> suddenly the Home Guard gave a cheer and it was taken up by the<br> other uniformed guests. The young girls clapped their hands and<br> jumped excitedly.<br><br> ‘Don't you think it's--it's just--just a little like a slave<br> auction?’ whispered Melanie, staring uncertainly at the embattled<br> doctor who heretofore had been perfect in her eyes.<br><br> Scarlett said nothing but her eyes glittered and her heart<br> contracted with a little pain. If only she were not a widow. If<br> only she were Scarlett O'Hara again, out there on the floor in an<br> apple-green dress with dark-green velvet ribbons dangling from her<br> bosom and tuberoses in her black hair--she'd lead that reel. Yes,<br> indeed! There'd be a dozen men battling for her and paying over<br> money to the doctor. Oh, to have to sit here, a wallflower<br> against her will and see Fanny or Maybelle lead the first reel as<br> the belle of Atlanta!<br><br> Above the tumult sounded the voice of the little Zouave, his<br> Creole accent very obvious: ‘Eef I may--twenty dollars for Mees<br> Maybelle Merriwether.’<br><br> Maybelle collapsed with blushes against Fanny's shoulder and the<br> two girls hid their faces in each other's necks and giggled, as<br> other voices began calling other names, other amounts of money.<br> Dr. Meade had begun to smile again, ignoring completely the<br> indignant whispers that came from the Ladies' Hospital Committee<br> in the corner.<br><br> At first, Mrs. Merriwether had stated flatly and loudly that her<br> Maybelle would never take part in such a proceeding; but as<br> Maybelle's name was called most often and the amount went up to<br> seventy-five dollars, her protests began to dwindle. Scarlett<br> leaned her elbows on the counter and almost glared at the excited<br> laughing crowd surging about the platform, their hands full of<br> Confederate paper money.<br><br> Now, they would all dance--except her and the old ladies. Now<br> everyone would have a good time, except her. She saw Rhett Butler<br> standing just below the doctor and, before she could change the<br> expression of her face, he saw her and one corner of his mouth<br> went down and one eyebrow went up. She jerked her chin up and<br> turned away from him and suddenly she heard her own name called--<br> called in an unmistakable Charleston voice that rang out above the<br> hubbub of other names.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Charles Hamilton--one hundred and fifty dollars--in gold.’<br><br> A sudden hush fell on the crowd both at the mention of the sum and<br> at the name. Scarlett was so startled she could not even move.<br> She remained sitting with her chin in her hands, her eyes wide<br> with astonishment. Everybody turned to look at her. She saw the<br> doctor lean down from the platform and whisper something to Rhett<br> Butler. Probably telling him she was in mourning and it was<br> impossible for her to appear on the floor. She saw Rhett's<br> shoulders shrug lazily.<br><br> ‘Another one of our belles, perhaps?’ questioned the doctor.<br><br> ‘No,’ said Rhett clearly, his eyes sweeping the crowd carelessly.<br> ‘Mrs. Hamilton.’<br><br> ‘I tell you it is impossible,’ said the doctor testily. ‘Mrs.<br> Hamilton will not--’<br><br> Scarlett heard a voice which, at first, she did not recognize as<br> her own.<br><br> ‘Yes, I will!’<br><br> She leaped to her feet, her heart hammering so wildly she feared<br> she could not stand, hammering with the thrill of being the center<br> of attention again, of being the most highly desired girl present<br> and oh, best of all, at the prospect of dancing again.<br><br> ‘Oh, I don't care! I don't care what they say!’ she whispered, as<br> a sweet madness swept over her. She tossed her head and sped out<br> of the booth, tapping her heels like castanets, snapping open her<br> black silk fan to its widest.<br><br> For a fleeting instant she saw Melanie's incredulous face, the<br> look on the chaperons' faces, the petulant girls, the enthusiastic<br> approval of the soldiers.<br><br> Then she was on the floor and Rhett Butler was advancing toward<br> her through the aisle of the crowd, that nasty mocking smile on<br> his face. But she didn't care--didn't care if he were Abe Lincoln<br> himself! She was going to dance again. She was going to lead the<br> reel. She swept him a low curtsy and a dazzling smile and he<br> bowed, one hand on his frilled bosom. Levi, horrified, was quick<br> to cover the situation and bawled: ‘Choose yo' padners fo' de<br> Ferginny reel!’<br><br> And the orchestra crashed into that best of all reel tunes,<br> ‘Dixie.’<br><br> <br><br> ‘How dare you make me so conspicuous, Captain Butler?’<br><br> ‘But, my dear Mrs. Hamilton, you so obviously wanted to be<br> conspicuous!’<br><br> ‘How could you call my name out in front of everybody?’<br><br> ‘You could have refused.’<br><br> ‘But--I owe it to the Cause--I--I couldn't think of myself when<br> you were offering so much in gold. Stop laughing, everyone is<br> looking at us.’<br><br> ‘They will look at us anyway. Don't try to palm off that twaddle<br> about the Cause to me. You wanted to dance and I gave you the<br> opportunity. This march is the last figure of the reel, isn't<br> it?’<br><br> ‘Yes--really, I must stop and sit down now.’<br><br> ‘Why? Have I stepped on your feet?’<br><br> ‘No--but they'll talk about me.’<br><br> ‘Do you really care--down in your heart?’<br><br> ‘Well--’<br><br> ‘You aren't committing any crime, are you? Why not dance the<br> waltz with me?’<br><br> ‘But if Mother ever--’<br><br> ‘Still tied to mamma's apronstrings.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you have the nastiest way of making virtues sound so stupid.’<br><br> ‘But virtues are stupid. Do you care if people talk?’<br><br> ‘No--but--well, let's don't talk about it. Thank goodness the<br> waltz is beginning. Reels always leave me breathless.’<br><br> ‘Don't dodge my questions. Has what other women said ever<br> mattered to you?’<br><br> ‘Oh, if you're going to pin me down--no! But a girl is supposed<br> to mind. Tonight, though, I don't care.’<br><br> ‘Bravo! Now you are beginning to think for yourself instead of<br> letting others think for you. That's the beginning of wisdom.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but--’<br><br> ‘When you've been talked about as much as I have, you'll realize<br> how little it matters. Just think, there's not a home in<br> Charleston where I am received. Not even my contribution to our<br> just and holy Cause lifts the ban.’<br><br> ‘How dreadful!’<br><br> ‘Oh, not at all. Until you've lost your reputation, you never<br> realize what a burden it was or what freedom really is.’<br><br> ‘You do talk scandalous!’<br><br> ‘Scandalously and truly. Always providing you have enough<br> courage--or money--you can do without a reputation.’<br><br> ‘Money can't buy everything.’<br><br> ‘Someone must have told you that. You'd never think of such a<br> platitude all by yourself. What can't it buy?’<br><br> ‘Oh, well, I don't know--not happiness or love, anyway.’<br><br> ‘Generally it can. And when it can't, it can buy some of the most<br> remarkable substitutes.’<br><br> ‘And have you so much money, Captain Butler?’<br><br> ‘What an ill-bred question, Mrs. Hamilton. I'm surprised. But,<br> yes. For a young man cut off without a shilling in early youth,<br> I've done very well. And I'm sure I'll clean up a million on the<br> blockade.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no!’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes! What most people don't seem to realize is that there<br> is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a<br> civilization as from the upbuilding of one.’<br><br> ‘And what does all that mean?’<br><br> ‘Your family and my family and everyone here tonight made their<br> money out of changing a wilderness into a civilization. That's<br> empire building. There's good money in empire building. But,<br> there's more in empire wrecking.’<br><br> ‘What empire are you talking about?’<br><br> ‘This empire we're living in--the South--the Confederacy--the<br> Cotton Kingdom--it's breaking up right under our feet. Only most<br> fools won't see it and take advantage of the situation created by<br> the collapse. I'm making my fortune out of the wreckage.’<br><br> ‘Then you really think we're going to get licked?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Why be an ostrich?’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear, it bores me to talk about such like. Don't you ever<br> say pretty things, Captain Butler?’<br><br> ‘Would it please you if I said your eyes were twin goldfish bowls<br> filled to the brim with the clearest green water and that when the<br> fish swim to the top, as they are doing now, you are devilishly<br> charming?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I don't like that. . . . Isn't the music gorgeous? Oh, I<br> could waltz forever! I didn't know I had missed it so!’<br><br> ‘You are the most beautiful dancer I've ever held in my arms.’<br><br> ‘Captain Butler, you must not hold me so tightly. Everybody is<br> looking.’<br><br> ‘If no one were looking, would you care?’<br><br> ‘Captain Butler, you forget yourself.’<br><br> ‘Not for a minute. How could I, with you in my arms? . . . What<br> is that tune? Isn't it new?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Isn't it divine? It's something we captured from the<br> Yankees.’<br><br> ‘What's the name of it?’<br><br> ‘'When This Cruel War Is Over.'‘<br><br> ‘What are the words? Sing them to me.’<br><br> <br> ‘Dearest one, do you remember<br> When we last did meet?<br> When you told me how you loved me,<br> Kneeling at my feet?<br> Oh, how proud you stood before me<br> In your suit of gray,<br> When you vowed from me and country<br> Ne'er to go astray.<br> Weeping sad and lonely,<br> Sighs and tears how vain!<br> When this cruel war is over<br> Pray that we meet again!’<br><br> <br> ‘Of course, it was 'suit of blue' but we changed it to 'gray.' . . .<br> Oh, you waltz so well, Captain Butler. Most big men don't, you<br> know. And to think it will be years and years before I'll dance<br> again.’<br><br> ‘It will only be a few minutes. I'm going to bid you in for the<br> next reel--and the next and the next.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no, I couldn't! You mustn't! My reputation will be ruined.’<br><br> ‘It's in shreds already, so what does another dance matter? Maybe<br> I'll give the other boys a chance after I've had five or six, but<br> I must have the last one.’<br><br> ‘Oh, all right. I know I'm crazy but I don't care. I don't care<br> a bit what anybody says. I'm so tired of sitting at home. I'm<br> going to dance and dance--’<br><br> ‘And not wear black? I loathe funeral crepe.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I couldn't take off mourning--Captain Butler, you must not<br> hold me so tightly. I'll be mad at you if you do.’<br><br> ‘And you look gorgeous when you are mad. I'll squeeze you again--<br> there--just to see if you will really get mad. You have no idea<br> how charming you were that day at Twelve Oaks when you were mad<br> and throwing things.’<br><br> ‘Oh, please--won't you forget that?’<br><br> ‘No, it is one of my most priceless memories--a delicately<br> nurtured Southern belle with her Irish up-- You are very Irish,<br> you know.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear, there's the end of the music and there's Aunt Pittypat<br> coming out of the back room. I know Mrs. Merriwether must have<br> told her. Oh, for goodness' sakes, let's walk over and look out<br> the window. I don't want her to catch me now. Her eyes are as<br> big as saucers.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER X<br><br> <br> Over the waffles next morning, Pittypat was lachrymose, Melanie<br> was silent and Scarlett defiant.<br><br> ‘I don't care if they do talk. I'll bet I made more money for the<br> hospital than any girl there--more than all the messy old stuff we<br> sold, too.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear, what does the money matter?’ wailed Pittypat, wringing<br> her hands. ‘I just couldn't believe my eyes, and poor Charlie<br> hardly dead a year. . . . And that awful Captain Butler, making<br> you so conspicuous, and he's a terrible, terrible person,<br> Scarlett. Mrs. Whiting's cousin, Mrs. Coleman, whose husband came<br> from Charleston, told me about him. He's the black sheep of a<br> lovely family--oh, how could any of the Butlers ever turn out<br> anything like him? He isn't received in Charleston and he has the<br> fastest reputation and there was something about a girl--something<br> so bad Mrs. Coleman didn't even know what it was--’<br><br> ‘Oh, I can't believe he's that bad,’ said Melly gently. ‘He<br> seemed a perfect gentleman and when you think how brave he's been,<br> running the blockade--’<br><br> ‘He isn't brave,’ said Scarlett perversely, pouring half a pitcher<br> of syrup over her waffles. ‘He just does it for money. He told<br> me so. He doesn't care anything about the Confederacy and he says<br> we're going to get licked. But he dances divinely.’<br><br> Her audience was speechless with horror.<br><br> ‘I'm tired of sitting at home and I'm not going to do it any<br> longer. If they all talked about me about last night, then my<br> reputation is already gone and it won't matter what else they<br> say.’<br><br> It did not occur to her that the idea was Rhett Butler's. It came<br> so patly and fitted so well with what she was thinking.<br><br> ‘Oh! What will your mother say when she hears? What will she<br> think of me?’<br><br> A cold qualm of guilt assailed Scarlett at the thought of Ellen's<br> consternation, should she ever learn of her daughter's scandalous<br> conduct. But she took heart at the thought of the twenty-five<br> miles between Atlanta and Tara. Miss Pitty certainly wouldn't<br> tell Ellen. It would put her in such a bad light as a chaperon.<br> And if Pitty didn't tattle, she was safe.<br><br> ‘I think--’ said Pitty, ‘yes, I think I'd better write Henry a<br> letter about it--much as I hate it--but he's our only male<br> relative, and make him go speak reprovingly to Captain Butler--<br> Oh, dear, if Charlie were only alive-- You must never, never<br> speak to that man again, Scarlett.’<br><br> Melanie had been sitting quietly, her hands in her lap, her<br> waffles cooling on her plate. She arose and, coming behind<br> Scarlett, put her arms about her neck.<br><br> ‘Darling,’ she said, ‘don't you get upset. I understand and it<br> was a brave thing you did last night and it's going to help the<br> hospital a lot. And if anybody dares say one little word about<br> you, I'll tend to them. . . . Aunt Pitty, don't cry. It has been<br> hard on Scarlett, not going anywhere. She's just a baby.’ Her<br> fingers played in Scarlett's black hair. ‘And maybe we'd all be<br> better off if we went out occasionally to parties. Maybe we've<br> been very selfish, staying here with our grief. War times aren't<br> like other times. When I think of all the soldiers in town who<br> are far from home and haven't any friends to call on at night--and<br> the ones in the hospital who are well enough to be out of bed and<br> not well enough to go back in the army-- Why, we have been<br> selfish. We ought to have three convalescents in our house this<br> minute, like everybody else, and some of the soldiers out to<br> dinner every Sunday. There, Scarlett, don't you fret. People<br> won't talk when they understand. We know you loved Charlie.’<br><br> Scarlett was far from fretting and Melanie's soft hands in her<br> hair were irritating. She wanted to jerk her head away and say<br> ‘Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!’ for the warming memory was still on her of<br> how the Home Guard and the militia and the soldiers from the<br> hospital had fought for her dances last night. Of all the people<br> in the world, she didn't want Melly for a defender. She could<br> defend herself, thank you, and if the old cats wanted to squall--<br> well, she could get along without the old cats. There were too<br> many nice officers in the world for her to bother about what old<br> women said.<br><br> Pittypat was dabbing at her eyes under Melanie's soothing words<br> when Prissy entered with a bulky letter.<br><br> ‘Fer you. Miss Melly. A lil nigger boy brung it.’<br><br> ‘For me?’ said Melly, wondering, as she ripped open the envelope.<br><br> Scarlett was making headway with her waffles and so noticed<br> nothing until she heard a burst of tears from Melly and, looking<br> up, saw Aunt Pittypat's hand go to her heart.<br><br> ‘Ashley's dead!’ screamed Pittypat, throwing her head back and<br> letting her arms go limp.<br><br> ‘Oh, my God!’ cried Scarlett, her blood turning to ice water.<br><br> ‘No! No!’ cried Melanie. ‘Quick! Her smelling salts, Scarlett!<br> There, there, honey, do you feel better? Breathe deep. No, it's<br> not Ashley. I'm so sorry I scared you. I was crying because I'm<br> so happy,’ and suddenly she opened her clenched palm and pressed<br> some object that was in it to her lips. ‘I'm so happy,’ and burst<br> into tears again.<br><br> Scarlett caught a fleeting glimpse and saw that it was a broad<br> gold ring.<br><br> ‘Read it,’ said Melly, pointing to the letter on the floor. ‘Oh,<br> how sweet, how kind, he is!’<br><br> Scarlett, bewildered, picked up the single sheet and saw written<br> in a black, bold hand: ‘The Confederacy may need the lifeblood of<br> its men but not yet does it demand the heart's blood of its women.<br> Accept, dear Madam, this token of my reverence for your courage<br> and do not think that your sacrifice has been in vain, for this<br> ring has been redeemed at ten times its value. Captain Rhett<br> Butler.’<br><br> Melanie slipped the ring on her finger and looked at it lovingly.<br><br> ‘I told you he was a gentleman, didn't I?’ she said turning to<br> Pittypat, her smile bright through the teardrops on her face. ‘No<br> one but a gentleman of refinement and thoughtfulness would ever<br> have thought how it broke my heart to-- I'll send my gold chain<br> instead. Aunt Pittypat, you must write him a note and invite him<br> to Sunday dinner so I can thank him.’<br><br> In the excitement, neither of the others seemed to have thought<br> that Captain Butler had not returned Scarlett's ring, too. But<br> she thought of it, annoyed. And she knew it had not been Captain<br> Butler's refinement that had prompted so gallant a gesture. It<br> was that he intended to be asked into Pittypat's house and knew<br> unerringly how to get the invitation.<br><br> <br><br> ‘I was greatly disturbed to hear of your recent conduct,’ ran<br> Ellen's letter and Scarlett, who was reading it at the table,<br> scowled. Bad news certainly traveled swiftly. She had often<br> heard in Charleston and Savannah that Atlanta people gossiped more<br> and meddled in other people's business more than any other people<br> in the South, and now she believed it. The bazaar had taken place<br> Monday night and today was only Thursday. Which of the old cats<br> had taken it upon herself to write Ellen? For a moment she<br> suspected Pittypat but immediately abandoned that thought. Poor<br> Pittypat had been quaking in her number-three shoes for fear of<br> being blamed for Scarlett's forward conduct and would be the last<br> to notify Ellen of her own inadequate chaperonage. Probably it<br> was Mrs. Merriwether.<br><br> ‘It is difficult for me to believe that you could so forget<br> yourself and your rearing. I will pass over the impropriety of<br> your appearing publicly while in mourning, realizing your warm<br> desire to be of assistance to the hospital. But to dance, and<br> with such a man as Captain Butler! I have heard much of him (as<br> who has not?) and Pauline wrote me only last week that he is a man<br> of bad repute and not even received by his own family in<br> Charleston, except of course by his heartbroken mother. He is a<br> thoroughly bad character who would take advantage of your youth<br> and innocence to make you conspicuous and publicly disgrace you<br> and your family. How could Miss Pittypat have so neglected her<br> duty to you?’<br><br> Scarlett looked across the table at her aunt. The old lady had<br> recognized Ellen's handwriting and her fat little mouth was pursed<br> in a frightened way, like a baby who fears a scolding and hopes to<br> ward it off by tears.<br><br> ‘I am heartbroken to think that you could so soon forget your<br> rearing. I have thought of calling you home immediately but will<br> leave that to your father's discretion. He will be in Atlanta<br> Friday to speak with Captain Butler and to escort you home. I<br> fear he will be severe with you despite my pleadings. I hope and<br> pray it was only youth and thoughtlessness that prompted such<br> forward conduct. No one can wish to serve our Cause more than I,<br> and I wish my daughters to feel the same way, but to disgrace--’<br><br> There was more in the same vein but Scarlett did not finish it.<br> For once, she was thoroughly frightened. She did not feel<br> reckless and defiant now. She felt as young and guilty as when<br> she was ten and had thrown a buttered biscuit at Suellen at the<br> table. To think of her gentle mother reproving her so harshly and<br> her father coming to town to talk to Captain Butler. The real<br> seriousness of the matter grew on her. Gerald was going to be<br> severe. This was one time when she knew she couldn't wiggle out<br> of her punishment by sitting on his knee and being sweet and pert.<br><br> ‘Not--not bad news?’ quavered Pittypat.<br><br> ‘Pa is coming tomorrow and he's going to land on me like a duck on<br> a June bug,’ answered Scarlett dolorously.<br><br> ‘Prissy, find my salts,’ fluttered Pittypat, pushing back her<br> chair from her half-eaten meal. ‘I--I feel faint.’<br><br> ‘Dey's in yo' skirt pocket,’ said Prissy, who had been hovering<br> behind Scarlett, enjoying the sensational drama. Mist' Gerald in<br> a temper was always exciting, providing his temper was not<br> directed at her kinky head. Pitty fumbled at her skirt and held<br> the vial to her nose.<br><br> ‘You all must stand by me and not leave me alone with him for one<br> minute,’ cried Scarlett. ‘He's so fond of you both, and if you<br> are with me he can't fuss at me.’<br><br> ‘I couldn't,’ said Pittypat weakly, rising to her feet. ‘I--I<br> feel ill. I must go lie down. I shall lie down all day tomorrow.<br> You must give him my excuses.’<br><br> ‘Coward!’ thought Scarlett, glowering at her.<br><br> Melly rallied to the defense, though white and frightened at the<br> prospect of facing the fire-eating Mr. O'Hara. ‘I'll--I'll help<br> you explain how you did it for the hospital. Surely he'll<br> understand.’<br><br> ‘No, he won't,’ said Scarlett. ‘And oh, I shall die if I have to<br> go back to Tara in disgrace, like Mother threatens!’<br><br> ‘Oh, you can't go home,’ cried Pittypat, bursting into tears. ‘If<br> you did I should be forced--yes, forced to ask Henry to come live<br> with us, and you know I just couldn't live with Henry. I'm so<br> nervous with just Melly in the house at night, with so many<br> strange men in town. You're so brave I don't mind being here<br> without a man!’<br><br> ‘Oh, he couldn't take you to Tara!’ said Melly, looking as if she<br> too would cry in a moment. ‘This is your home now. What would we<br> ever do without you?’<br><br> ‘You'd be glad to do without me if you knew what I really think of<br> you,’ thought Scarlett sourly, wishing there were some other<br> person than Melanie to help ward off Gerald's wrath. It was<br> sickening to be defended by someone you disliked so much.<br><br> ‘Perhaps we should recall our invitation to Captain Butler--’<br> began Pittypat.<br><br> ‘Oh, we couldn't! It would be the height of rudeness!’ cried<br> Melly, distressed.<br><br> ‘Help me to bed. I'm going to be ill,’ moaned Pittypat. ‘Oh,<br> Scarlett, how could you have brought this on me?’<br><br> Pittypat was ill and in her bed when Gerald arrived the next<br> afternoon. She sent many messages of regret to him from behind<br> her closed door and left the two frightened girls to preside over<br> the supper table. Gerald was ominously silent although he kissed<br> Scarlett and pinched Melanie's cheek approvingly and called her<br> ‘Cousin Melly.’ Scarlett would have infinitely preferred<br> bellowing oaths and accusations. True to her promise, Melanie<br> clung to Scarlett's skirts like a small rustling shadow and Gerald<br> was too much of a gentleman to upbraid his daughter in front of<br> her. Scarlett had to admit that Melanie carried off things very<br> well, acting as if she knew nothing was amiss, and she actually<br> succeeded in engaging Gerald in conversation, once the supper had<br> been served.<br><br> ‘I want to know all about the County,’ she said, beaming upon him.<br> ‘India and Honey are such poor correspondents, and I know you know<br> everything that goes on down there. Do tell us about Joe<br> Fontaine's wedding.’<br><br> Gerald warmed to the flattery and said that the wedding had been a<br> quiet affair, ‘not like you girls had,’ for Joe had only a few<br> days' furlough. Sally, the little Munroe chit, looked very<br> pretty. No, he couldn't recall what she wore but he did hear that<br> she didn't have a ‘second-day’ dress.<br><br> ‘She didn't!’ exclaimed the girls, scandalized.<br><br> ‘Sure, because she didn't have a second day,’ Gerald explained and<br> bawled with laughter before recalling that perhaps such remarks<br> were not fit for female ears. Scarlett's spirits soared at his<br> laugh and she blessed Melanie's tact.<br><br> ‘Back Joe went to Virginia the next day,’ Gerald added hastily.<br> ‘There was no visiting about and dancing afterwards. The Tarleton<br> twins are home.’<br><br> ‘We heard that. Have they recovered?’<br><br> ‘They weren't badly wounded. Stuart had it in the knee and a<br> minie ball went through Brent's shoulder. You had it, too, that<br> they were mentioned in dispatches for bravery?’<br><br> ‘No! Tell us!’<br><br> ‘Hare brained--both of them. I'm believing there's Irish in<br> them,’ said Gerald complacently. ‘I forget what they did, but<br> Brent is a lieutenant now.’<br><br> Scarlett felt pleased at hearing of their exploits, pleased in a<br> proprietary manner. Once a man had been her beau, she never lost<br> the conviction that he belonged to her, and all his good deeds<br> redounded to her credit.<br><br> ‘And I've news that'll be holding the both of you,’ said Gerald.<br> ‘They're saying Stu is courting at Twelve Oaks again.’<br><br> ‘Honey or India?’ questioned Melly excitedly, while Scarlett<br> stared almost indignantly.<br><br> ‘Oh, Miss India, to be sure. Didn't she have him fast till this<br> baggage of mine winked at him?’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ said Melly, somewhat embarrassed at Gerald's outspokenness.<br><br> ‘And more than that, young Brent has taken to hanging about Tara.<br> Now!’<br><br> Scarlett could not speak. The defection of her beaux was almost<br> insulting. Especially when she recalled how wildly both the twins<br> had acted when she told them she was going to marry Charles.<br> Stuart had even threatened to shoot Charles, or Scarlett, or<br> himself, or all three. It had been most exciting.<br><br> ‘Suellen?’ questioned Melly, breaking into a pleased smile. ‘But<br> I thought Mr. Kennedy--’<br><br> ‘Oh, him?’ said Gerald. ‘Frank Kennedy still pussyfoots about,<br> afraid of his shadow, and I'll be asking him his intentions soon<br> if he doesn't speak up. No, 'tis me baby.’<br><br> ‘Carreen?’<br><br> ‘She's nothing but a child!’ said Scarlett sharply, finding her<br> tongue.<br><br> ‘She's little more than a year younger than you were, Miss, when<br> you were married,’ retorted Gerald. ‘Is it you're grudging your<br> old beau to your sister?’<br><br> Melly blushed, unaccustomed to such frankness, and signaled Peter<br> to bring in the sweet potato pie. Frantically she cast about in<br> her mind for some other topic of conversation which would not be<br> so personal but which would divert Mr. O'Hara from the purpose of<br> his trip. She could think of nothing but, once started, Gerald<br> needed no stimulus other than an audience. He talked on about the<br> thievery of the commissary department which every month increased<br> its demands, the knavish stupidity of Jefferson Davis and the<br> blackguardery of the Irish who were being enticed into the Yankee<br> army by bounty money.<br><br> When the wine was on the table and the two girls rose to leave<br> him, Gerald cocked a severe eye at his daughter from under<br> frowning brows and commanded her presence alone for a few minutes.<br> Scarlett cast a despairing glance at Melly, who twisted her<br> handkerchief helplessly and went out, softly pulling the sliding<br> doors together.<br><br> ‘How now, Missy!’ bawled Gerald, pouring himself a glass of port.<br> ‘'Tis a fine way to act! Is it another husband you're trying to<br> catch and you so fresh a widow?’<br><br> ‘Not so loud, Pa, the servants--’<br><br> ‘They know already, to be sure, and everybody knows of our<br> disgrace. And your poor mother taking to her bed with it and me<br> not able to hold up me head. 'Tis shameful. No, Puss, you need<br> not think to get around me with tears this time,’ he said hastily<br> and with some panic in his voice as Scarlett's lids began to bat<br> and her mouth to screw up. ‘I know you. You'd be flirting at the<br> wake of your husband. Don't cry. There, I'll be saying no more<br> tonight, for I'm going to see this fine Captain Butler who makes<br> so light of me daughter's reputation. But in the morning-- There<br> now, don't cry. Twill do you no good at all, at all. 'Tis firm<br> that I am and back to Tara you'll be going tomorrow before you're<br> disgracing the lot of us again. Don't cry, pet. Look what I've<br> brought you! Isn't that a pretty present? See, look! How could<br> you be putting so much trouble on me, bringing me all the way up<br> here when 'tis a busy man I am? Don't cry!’<br><br> <br><br> Melanie and Pittypat had gone to sleep hours before, but Scarlett<br> lay awake in the warm darkness, her heart heavy and frightened in<br> her breast. To leave Atlanta when life had just begun again and<br> go home and face Ellen! She would rather die than face her<br> mother. She wished she were dead, this very minute, then everyone<br> would be sorry they had been so hateful. She turned and tossed on<br> the hot pillow until a noise far up the quiet street reached her<br> ears. It was an oddly familiar noise, blurred and indistinct<br> though it was. She slipped out of bed and went to the window.<br> The street with its over-arching trees was softly, deeply black<br> under a dim star-studded sky. The noise came closer, the sound of<br> wheels, the plod of a horse's hooves and voices. And suddenly she<br> grinned for, as a voice thick with brogue and whisky came to her,<br> raised in ‘Peg in a Low-backed Car,’ she knew. This might not be<br> Jonesboro on Court Day, but Gerald was coming home in the same<br> condition.<br><br> She saw the dark bulk of a buggy stop in front of the house and<br> indistinct figures alight. Someone was with him. Two figures<br> paused at the gate and she heard the click of the latch and<br> Gerald's voice came plain,<br><br> ‘Now I'll be giving you the 'Lament for Robert Emmet.' 'Tis a<br> song you should be knowing, me lad. I'll teach it to you.’<br><br> ‘I'd like to learn it,’ replied his companion, a hint of buried<br> laughter in his flat drawling voice. ‘But not now, Mr. O'Hara.’<br><br> ‘Oh, my God, it's that hateful Butler man!’ thought Scarlett, at<br> first annoyed. Then she took heart. At least they hadn't shot<br> each other. And they must be on amicable terms to be coming home<br> together at this hour and in this condition.<br><br> ‘Sing it I will and listen you will or I'll be shooting you for<br> the Orangeman you are.’<br><br> ‘Not Orangeman--Charlestonian.’<br><br> ‘'Tis no better. 'Tis worse. I have two sister-in-laws in<br> Charleston and I know.’<br><br> ‘Is he going to tell the whole neighborhood?’ thought Scarlett<br> panic-stricken, reaching for her wrapper. But what could she do?<br> She couldn't go downstairs at this hour of the night and drag her<br> father in from the street.<br><br> With no further warning, Gerald, who was hanging on the gate,<br> threw back his head and began the ‘Lament,’ in a roaring bass.<br> Scarlett rested her elbows on the window sill and listened,<br> grinning unwillingly. It would be a beautiful song, if only her<br> father could carry a tune. It was one of her favorite songs and,<br> for a moment, she followed the fine melancholy of those verses<br> beginning:<br><br> <br> ‘She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps<br> And lovers are round her sighing.’<br><br> <br> The song went on and she heard stirrings in Pittypat's and Melly's<br> rooms. Poor things, they'd certainly be upset. They were not<br> used to full-blooded males like Gerald. When the song had<br> finished, two forms merged into one, came up the walk and mounted<br> the steps. A discreet knock sounded at the door.<br><br> ‘I suppose I must go down,’ thought Scarlett. ‘After all he's my<br> father and poor Pitty would die before she'd go.’ Besides, she<br> didn't want the servants to see Gerald in his present condition.<br> And if Peter tried to put him to bed, he might get unruly. Pork<br> was the only one who knew how to handle him.<br><br> She pinned the wrapper close about her throat, lit her bedside<br> candle and hurried down the dark stairs into the front hall.<br> Setting the candle on the stand, she unlocked the door and in the<br> wavering light she saw Rhett Butler, not a ruffle disarranged,<br> supporting her small, thickset father. The ‘Lament’ had evidently<br> been Gerald's swan song for he was frankly hanging onto his<br> companion's arm. His hat was gone, his crisp long hair was<br> tumbled in a white mane, his cravat was under one ear, and there<br> were liquor stains down his shirt bosom.<br><br> ‘Your father, I believe?’ said Captain Butler, his eyes amused in<br> his swarthy face. He took in her dishabille in one glance that<br> seemed to penetrate through her wrapper.<br><br> ‘Bring him in,’ she said shortly, embarrassed at her attire,<br> infuriated at Gerald for putting her in a position where this man<br> could laugh at her.<br><br> Rhett propelled Gerald forward. ‘Shall I help you take him<br> upstairs? You cannot manage him. He's quite heavy.’<br><br> Her mouth fell open with horror at the audacity of his proposal.<br> Just imagine what Pittypat and Melly cowering in their beds would<br> think, should Captain Butler come upstairs!<br><br> ‘Mother of God, no! In here, in the parlor on that settee.’<br><br> ‘The suttee, did you say?’<br><br> ‘I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head. Here. Now<br> lay him down.’<br><br> ‘Shall I take off his boots?’<br><br> ‘No. He's slept in them before.’<br><br> She could have bitten off her tongue for that slip, for he laughed<br> softly as he crossed Gerald's legs.<br><br> ‘Please go, now.’<br><br> He walked out into the dim hall and picked up the hat he had<br> dropped on the doorsill.<br><br> ‘I will be seeing you Sunday at dinner,’ he said and went out,<br> closing the door noiselessly behind him.<br><br> Scarlett arose at five-thirty, before the servants had come in<br> from the back yard to start breakfast, and slipped down the steps<br> to the quiet lower floor. Gerald was awake, sitting on the sofa,<br> his hands gripping his bullet head as if he wished to crush it<br> between his palms. He looked up furtively as she entered. The<br> pain of moving his eyes was too excruciating to be borne and he<br> groaned.<br><br> ‘Wurra the day!’<br><br> ‘It's a fine way you've acted, Pa,’ she began in a furious<br> whisper. ‘Coming home at such an hour and waking all the<br> neighbors with your singing.’<br><br> ‘I sang?’<br><br> ‘Sang! You woke the echoes singing the 'Lament.'‘<br><br> ‘'Tis nothing I'm remembering.’<br><br> ‘The neighbors will remember it till their dying day and so will<br> Miss Pittypat and Melanie.’<br><br> ‘Mother of Sorrows,’ moaned Gerald, moving a thickly furred tongue<br> around parched lips. ‘'Tis little I'm remembering after the game<br> started.’<br><br> ‘Game?’<br><br> ‘That laddybuck Butler bragged that he was the best poker player<br> in--’<br><br> ‘How much did you lose?’<br><br> ‘Why, I won, naturally. A drink or two helps me game.’<br><br> ‘Look in your wallet.’<br><br> As if every movement was agony, Gerald removed his wallet from his<br> coat and opened it. It was empty and he looked at it in forlorn<br> bewilderment.<br><br> ‘Five hundred dollars,’ he said. ‘And 'twas to buy things from<br> the blockaders for Mrs. O'Hara, and now not even fare left to<br> Tara.’<br><br> As she looked indignantly at the empty purse, an idea took form in<br> Scarlett's mind and grew swiftly.<br><br> ‘I'll not be holding up my head in this town,’ she began. ‘You've<br> disgraced us all.’<br><br> ‘Hold your tongue, Puss. Can you not see me head is bursting?’<br><br> ‘Coming home drunk with a man like Captain Butler, and singing at<br> the top of your lungs for everyone to hear and losing all that<br> money.’<br><br> ‘The man is too clever with cards to be a gentleman. He--’<br><br> ‘What will Mother say when she hears?’<br><br> He looked up in sudden anguished apprehension. ‘You wouldn't be<br> telling your mother a word and upsetting her, now would you?’<br><br> Scarlett said nothing but pursed her lips.<br><br> ‘Think now how 'twould hurt her and her so gentle.’<br><br> ‘And to think, Pa, that you said only last night I had disgraced<br> the family! Me, with my poor little dance to make money for the<br> soldiers. Oh, I could cry.’<br><br> ‘Well, don't,’ pleaded Gerald. ‘'Twould be more than me poor head<br> could stand and sure 'tis bursting now.’<br><br> ‘And you said that I--’<br><br> ‘Now Puss, now Puss, don't you be hurt at what your poor old<br> father said and him not meaning a thing and not understanding a<br> thing! Sure, you're a fine well-meaning girl, I'm sure.’<br><br> ‘And wanting to take me home in disgrace.’<br><br> ‘Ah, darling, I wouldn't be doing that. 'Twas to tease you. You<br> won't be mentioning the money to your mother and her in a flutter<br> about expenses already?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Scarlett frankly, ‘I won't, if you'll let me stay here<br> and if you'll tell Mother that 'twas nothing but a lot of gossip<br> from old cats.’<br><br> Gerald looked mournfully at his daughter.<br><br> ‘'Tis blackmail, no less.’<br><br> ‘And last night was a scandal, no less.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ he began wheedlingly, ‘we'll be forgetting all that. And<br> do you think a fine pretty lady like Miss Pittypat would be having<br> any brandy in the house? The hair of the dog--’<br><br> Scarlett turned and tiptoed through the silent hall into the<br> dining room to get the brandy bottle that she and Melly privately<br> called the ‘swoon bottle’ because Pittypat always took a sip from<br> it when her fluttering heart made her faint--or seem to faint.<br> Triumph was written on her face and no trace of shame for her<br> unfilial treatment of Gerald. Now Ellen would be soothed with<br> lies if any other busybody wrote her. Now she could stay in<br> Atlanta. Now she could do almost as she pleased, Pittypat being<br> the weak vessel that she was. She unlocked the cellaret and stood<br> for a moment with the bottle and glass pressed to her bosom.<br><br> She saw a long vista of picnics by the bubbling waters of<br> Peachtree Creek and barbecues at Stone Mountain, receptions and<br> balls, afternoon danceables, buggy rides and Sunday-night buffet<br> suppers. She would be there, right in the heart of things, right<br> in the center of a crowd of men. And men fell in love so easily,<br> after you did little things for them at the hospital. She<br> wouldn't mind the hospital so much now. Men were so easily<br> stirred when they had been ill. They fell into a clever girl's<br> hand just like the ripe peaches at Tara when the trees were gently<br> shaken.<br><br> She went back toward her father with the reviving liquor, thanking<br> Heaven that the famous O'Hara head had not been able to survive<br> last night's bout and wondering suddenly if Rhett Butler had had<br> anything to do with that.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XI<br><br> <br> On an afternoon of the following week, Scarlett came home from the<br> hospital weary and indignant. She was tired from standing on her<br> feet all morning and irritable because Mrs. Merriwether had<br> scolded her sharply for sitting on a soldier's bed while she<br> dressed his wounded arm. Aunt Pitty and Melanie, bonneted in<br> their best, were on the porch with Wade and Prissy, ready for<br> their weekly round of calls. Scarlett asked to be excused from<br> accompanying them and went upstairs to her room.<br><br> When the last sound of carriage wheels had died away and she knew<br> the family was safely out of sight, she slipped quietly into<br> Melanie's room and turned the key in the lock. It was a prim,<br> virginal little room and it lay still and warm in the slanting<br> rays of the four-o'clock sun. The floors were glistening and bare<br> except for a few bright rag rugs, and the white walls unornamented<br> save for one corner which Melanie had fitted up as a shrine.<br><br> Here, under a draped Confederate flag, hung the gold-hilted saber<br> that Melanie's father had carried in the Mexican War, the same<br> saber Charles had worn away to war. Charles' sash and pistol belt<br> hung there too, with his revolver in the holster. Between the<br> saber and the pistol was a daguerreotype of Charles himself, very<br> stiff and proud in his gray uniform, his great brown eyes shining<br> out of the frame and a shy smile on his lips.<br><br> Scarlett did not even glance at the picture but went unhesitatingly<br> across the room to the square rosewood writing box that stood on the<br> table beside the narrow bed. From it she took a pack of letters<br> tied together with a blue ribbon, addressed in Ashley's hand to<br> Melanie. On the top was the letter which had come that morning and<br> this one she opened.<br><br> When Scarlett first began secretly reading these letters, she had<br> been so stricken of conscience and so fearful of discovery she<br> could hardly open the envelopes for trembling. Now, her never-<br> too-scrupulous sense of honor was dulled by repetition of the<br> offense and even fear of discovery had subsided. Occasionally,<br> she thought with a sinking heart, ‘What would Mother say if she<br> knew?’ She knew Ellen would rather see her dead than know her<br> guilty of such dishonor. This had worried Scarlett at first, for<br> she still wanted to be like her mother in every respect. But the<br> temptation to read the letters was too great and she put the<br> thought of Ellen out of her mind. She had become adept at putting<br> unpleasant thoughts out of her mind these days. She had learned<br> to say, ‘I won't think of this or that bothersome thought now.<br> I'll think about it tomorrow.’ Generally when tomorrow came, the<br> thought either did not occur at all or it was so attenuated by the<br> delay it was not very troublesome. So the matter of Ashley's<br> letters did not lie very heavily on her conscience.<br><br> Melanie was always generous with the letters, reading parts of<br> them aloud to Aunt Pitty and Scarlett. But it was the part she<br> did not read that tormented Scarlett, that drove her to<br> surreptitious reading of her sister-in-law's mail. She had to<br> know if Ashley had come to love his wife since marrying her. She<br> had to know if he even pretended to love her. Did he address<br> tender endearments to her? What sentiments did he express and<br> with what warmth?<br><br> She carefully smoothed out the letter.<br><br> Ashley's small even writing leaped up at her as she read, ‘My dear<br> wife,’ and she breathed in relief. He wasn't calling Melanie<br> ‘Darling’ or ‘Sweetheart’ yet.<br><br> ‘My Dear wife: You write me saying you are alarmed lest I be<br> concealing my real thoughts from you and you ask me what is<br> occupying my mind these days--’<br><br> ‘Mother of God!’ thought Scarlett, in a panic of guilt.<br> ‘'Concealing his real thoughts.' Can Melly have read his mind?<br> Or my mind? Does she suspect that he and I--’<br><br> Her hands trembled with fright as she held the letter closer, but<br> as she read the next paragraph she relaxed.<br><br> ‘Dear Wife, if I have concealed aught from you it is because I did<br> not wish to lay a burden on your shoulders, to add to your worries<br> for my physical safety with those of my mental turmoil. But I can<br> keep nothing from you, for you know me too well. Do not be<br> alarmed. I have no wound. I have not been ill. I have enough to<br> eat and occasionally a bed to sleep in. A soldier can ask for no<br> more. But, Melanie, heavy thoughts lie on my heart and I will<br> open my heart to you.<br><br> ‘These summer nights I lie awake, long after the camp is sleeping,<br> and I look up at the stars and, over and over, I wonder, 'Why are<br> you here, Ashley Wilkes? What are you fighting for?'<br><br> ‘Not for honor and glory, certainly. War is a dirty business and<br> I do not like dirt. I am not a soldier and I have no desire to<br> seek the bubble reputation even in the cannon's mouth. Yet, here<br> I am at the wars--whom God never intended to be other than a<br> studious country gentleman. For, Melanie, bugles do not stir my<br> blood nor drums entice my feet and I see too clearly that we have<br> been betrayed, betrayed by our arrogant Southern selves, believing<br> that one of us could whip a dozen Yankees, believing that King<br> Cotton could rule the world. Betrayed, too, by words and catch<br> phrases, prejudices and hatreds coming from the mouths of those<br> highly placed, those men whom we respected and revered--'King<br> Cotton, Slavery, States' Rights, Damn Yankees.'<br><br> ‘And so when I lie on my blanket and look up at the stars and say<br> 'What are you fighting for?' I think of States' Rights and cotton<br> and the darkies and the Yankees whom we have been bred to hate,<br> and I know that none of these is the reason why I am fighting.<br> Instead, I see Twelve Oaks and remember how the moonlight slants<br> across the white columns, and the unearthly way the magnolias<br> look, opening under the moon, and how the climbing roses make the<br> side porch shady even at the hottest noon. And I see Mother,<br> sewing there, as she did when I was a little boy. And I hear the<br> darkies coming home across the fields at dusk, tired and singing<br> and ready for supper, and the sound of the windlass as the bucket<br> goes down into the cool well. And there's the long view down the<br> road to the river, across the cotton fields, and the mist rising<br> from the bottom lands in the twilight. And that is why I'm here<br> who have no love of death or misery or glory and no hatred for<br> anyone. Perhaps that is what is called patriotism, love of home<br> and country. But Melanie, it goes deeper than that. For,<br> Melanie, these things I have named are but the symbols of the<br> thing for which I risk my life, symbols of the kind of life I<br> love. For I am fighting for the old days, the old ways I love so<br> much but which, I fear, are now gone forever, no matter how the<br> die may fall. For, win or lose, we lose just the same.<br><br> ‘If we win this war and have the Cotton Kingdom of our dreams, we<br> still have lost, for we will become a different people and the old<br> quiet ways will go. The world will be at our doors clamoring for<br> cotton and we can command our own price. Then, I fear, we will<br> become like the Yankees, at whose money-making activities,<br> acquisitiveness and commercialism we now sneer. And if we lose,<br> Melanie, if we lose!<br><br> ‘I am not afraid of danger or capture or wounds or even death, if<br> death must come, but I do fear that once this war is over, we will<br> never get back to the old times. And I belong in those old times.<br> I do not belong in this mad present of killing and I fear I will<br> not fit into any future, try though I may. Nor will you, my dear,<br> for you and I are of the same blood. I do not know what the<br> future will bring, but it cannot be as beautiful or as satisfying<br> as the past.<br><br> ‘I lie and look at the boys sleeping near me and I wonder if the<br> twins or Alex or Cade think these same thoughts. I wonder if they<br> know they are fighting for a Cause that was lost the minute the<br> first shot was fired, for our Cause is really our own way of<br> living and that is gone already. But I do not think they think<br> these things and they are lucky.<br><br> ‘I had not thought of this for us when I asked you to marry me. I<br> had thought of life going on at Twelve Oaks as it had always done,<br> peacefully, easily, unchanging. We are alike, Melanie, loving the<br> same quiet things, and I saw before us a long stretch of<br> uneventful years in which to read, hear music and dream. But not<br> this! Never this! That this could happen to us all, this<br> wrecking of old ways, this bloody slaughter and hate! Melanie,<br> nothing is worth it--States' Rights, nor slaves, nor cotton.<br> Nothing is worth what is happening to us now and what may happen,<br> for if the Yankees whip us the future will be one of incredible<br> horror. And, my dear, they may yet whip us.<br><br> ‘I should not write those words. I should not even think them.<br> But you have asked me what was in my heart, and the fear of defeat<br> is there. Do you remember at the barbecue, the day our engagement<br> was announced, that a man named Butler, a Charlestonian by his<br> accent, nearly caused a fight by his remarks about the ignorance<br> of Southerners? Do you recall how the twins wanted to shoot him<br> because he said we had few foundries and factories, mills and<br> ships, arsenals and machine shops? Do you recall how he said the<br> Yankee fleet could bottle us up so tightly we could not ship out<br> our cotton? He was right. We are fighting the Yankees' new<br> rifles with Revolutionary War muskets, and soon the blockade will<br> be too tight for even medical supplies to slip in. We should have<br> paid heed to cynics like Butler who knew, instead of statesmen who<br> felt--and talked. He said, in effect, that the South had nothing<br> with which to wage war but cotton and arrogance. Our cotton is<br> worthless and what he called arrogance is all that is left. But I<br> call that arrogance matchless courage. If--’<br><br> But Scarlett carefully folded up the letter without finishing it<br> and thrust it back into the envelope, too bored to read further.<br> Besides, the tone of the letter vaguely depressed her with its<br> foolish talk of defeat. After all, she wasn't reading Melanie's<br> mail to learn Ashley's puzzling and uninteresting ideas. She had<br> had to listen to enough of them when he sat on the porch at Tara<br> in days gone by.<br><br> All she wanted to know was whether he wrote impassioned letters to<br> his wife. So far he had not. She had read every letter in the<br> writing box and there was nothing in any one of them that a<br> brother might not have written to a sister. They were<br> affectionate, humorous, discursive, but not the letters of a<br> lover. Scarlett had received too many ardent love letters herself<br> not to recognize the authentic note of passion when she saw it.<br> And that note was missing. As always after her secret readings, a<br> feeling of smug satisfaction enveloped her, for she felt certain<br> that Ashley still loved her. And always she wondered sneeringly<br> why Melanie did not realize that Ashley only loved her as a<br> friend. Melanie evidently found nothing lacking in her husband's<br> messages but Melanie had had no other man's love letters with<br> which to compare Ashley's.’<br><br> ‘He writes such crazy letters,’ Scarlett thought. ‘If ever any<br> husband of mine wrote me such twaddle-twaddle, he'd certainly hear<br> from me! Why, even Charlie wrote better letters than these.’<br><br> She flipped back the edges of the letters, looking at the dates,<br> remembering their contents. In them there were no fine<br> descriptive pages of bivouacs and charges such as Darcy Meade<br> wrote his parents or poor Dallas McLure had written his old-maid<br> sisters, Misses Faith and Hope. The Meades and McLures proudly<br> read these letters all over the neighborhood, and Scarlett had<br> frequently felt a secret shame that Melanie had no such letters<br> from Ashley to read aloud at sewing circles.<br><br> It was as though when writing Melanie, Ashley tried to ignore the<br> war altogether, and sought to draw about the two of them a magic<br> circle of timelessness, shutting out everything that had happened<br> since Fort Sumter was the news of the day. It was almost as if he<br> were trying to believe there wasn't any war. He wrote of books<br> which he and Melanie had read and songs they had sung, of old<br> friends they knew and places he had visited on his Grand Tour.<br> Through the letters ran a wistful yearning to be back home at<br> Twelve Oaks, and for pages he wrote of the hunting and the long<br> rides through the still forest paths under frosty autumn stars,<br> the barbecues, the fish fries, the quiet of moonlight nights and<br> the serene charm of the old house.<br><br> She thought of his words in the letter she had just read: ‘Not<br> this! Never this!’ and they seemed to cry of a tormented soul<br> facing something he could not face, yet must face. It puzzled her<br> for, if he was not afraid of wounds and death, what was it he<br> feared? Unanalytical, she struggled with the complex thought.<br><br> ‘The war disturbs him and he--he doesn't like things that disturb<br> him. . . . Me, for instance. . . . He loved me but he was afraid<br> to marry me because--for fear I'd upset his way of thinking and<br> living. No, it wasn't exactly that he was afraid. Ashley isn't a<br> coward. He couldn't be when he's been mentioned in dispatches and<br> when Colonel Sloan wrote that letter to Melly all about his<br> gallant conduct in leading the charge. Once he's made up his mind<br> to do something, no one could be braver or more determined but--<br> He lives inside his head instead of outside in the world and he<br> hates to come out into the world and-- Oh, I don't know what it<br> is! If I'd just understood this one thing about him years ago, I<br> know he'd have married me.’<br><br> She stood for a moment holding the letters to her breast, thinking<br> longingly of Ashley. Her emotions toward him had not changed<br> since the day when she first fell in love with him. They were the<br> same emotions that struck her speechless that day when she was<br> fourteen years old and she had stood on the porch of Tara and seen<br> Ashley ride up smiling, his hair shining silver in the morning<br> sun. Her love was still a young girl's adoration for a man she<br> could not understand, a man who possessed all the qualities she<br> did not own but which she admired. He was still a young girl's<br> dream of the Perfect Knight and her dream asked no more than<br> acknowledgment of his love, went no further than hopes of a kiss.<br><br> After reading the letters, she felt certain he did love her,<br> Scarlett, even though he had married Melanie, and that certainty<br> was almost all that she desired. She was still that young and<br> untouched. Had Charles with his fumbling awkwardness and his<br> embarrassed intimacies tapped any of the deep vein of passionate<br> feeling within her, her dreams of Ashley would not be ending with<br> a kiss. But those few moonlight nights alone with Charles had not<br> touched her emotions or ripened her to maturity. Charles had<br> awakened no idea of what passion might be or tenderness or true<br> intimacy of body or spirit.<br><br> All that passion meant to her was servitude to inexplicable male<br> madness, unshared by females, a painful and embarrassing process<br> that led inevitably to the still more painful process of<br> childbirth. That marriage should be like this was no surprise to<br> her. Ellen had hinted before the wedding that marriage was<br> something women must bear with dignity and fortitude, and the<br> whispered comments of other matrons since her widowhood had<br> confirmed this. Scarlett was glad to be done with passion and<br> marriage.<br><br> She was done with marriage but not with love, for her love for<br> Ashley was something different, having nothing to do with passion<br> or marriage, something sacred and breathtakingly beautiful, an<br> emotion that grew stealthily through the long days of her enforced<br> silence, feeding on oft-thumbed memories and hopes.<br><br> She sighed as she carefully tied the ribbon about the packet,<br> wondering for the thousandth time just what it was in Ashley that<br> eluded her understanding. She tried to think the matter to some<br> satisfactory conclusion but, as always, the conclusion evaded her<br> uncomplex mind. She put the letters back in the lap secretary and<br> closed the lid. Then she frowned, for her mind went back to the<br> last part of the letter she had just read, to his mention of<br> Captain Butler. How strange that Ashley should be impressed by<br> something that scamp had said a year ago. Undeniably Captain<br> Butler was a scamp, for all that he danced divinely. No one but a<br> scamp would say the things about the Confederacy that he had said<br> at the bazaar.<br><br> She crossed the room to the mirror and patted her smooth hair<br> approvingly. Her spirits rose, as always at the sight of her<br> white skin and slanting green eyes, and she smiled to bring out<br> her dimples. Then she dismissed Captain Butler from her mind as<br> she happily viewed her reflection, remembering how Ashley had<br> always liked her dimples. No pang of conscience at loving another<br> woman's husband or reading that woman's mail disturbed her<br> pleasure in her youth and charm and her renewed assurance of<br> Ashley's love.<br><br> She unlocked the door and went down the dim winding stair with a<br> light heart. Halfway down she began singing ‘When This Cruel War<br> Is Over.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XII<br><br> <br> The war went on, successfully for the most part, but people had<br> stopped saying ‘One more victory and the war is over,’ just as<br> they had stopped saying the Yankees were cowards. It was obvious<br> to all now that the Yankees were far from cowardly and that it<br> would take more than one victory to conquer them. However, there<br> were the Confederate victories in Tennessee scored by General<br> Morgan and General Forrest and the triumph at the Second Battle of<br> Bull Run hung up like visible Yankee scalps to gloat over. But<br> there was a heavy price on these scalps. The hospitals and homes<br> of Atlanta were overflowing with the sick and wounded, and more<br> and more women were appearing in black. The monotonous rows of<br> soldiers' graves at Oakland Cemetery stretched longer every day.<br><br> Confederate money had dropped alarmingly and the price of food and<br> clothing had risen accordingly. The commissary was laying such<br> heavy levies on foodstuffs that the tables of Atlanta were<br> beginning to suffer. White flour was scarce and so expensive that<br> corn bread was universal instead of biscuits, rolls and waffles.<br> The butcher shops carried almost no beef and very little mutton,<br> and that mutton cost so much only the rich could afford it.<br> However there was still plenty of hog meat, as well as chickens<br> and vegetables.<br><br> The Yankee blockade about the Confederate ports had tightened, and<br> luxuries such as tea, coffee, silks, whalebone stays, colognes,<br> fashion magazines and books were scarce and dear. Even the<br> cheapest cotton goods had skyrocketed in price and ladies were<br> regretfully making their old dresses do another season. Looms<br> that had gathered dust for years had been brought down from<br> attics, and there were webs of homespun to be found in nearly<br> every parlor. Everyone, soldiers, civilians, women, children and<br> negroes, began to wear homespun. Gray, as the color of the<br> Confederate uniform, practically disappeared and homespun of a<br> butternut shade took its place.<br><br> Already the hospitals were worrying about the scarcity of quinine,<br> calomel, opium, chloroform and iodine. Linen and cotton bandages<br> were too precious now to be thrown away when used, and every lady<br> who nursed at the hospitals brought home baskets of bloody strips<br> to be washed and ironed and returned for use on other sufferers.<br><br> But to Scarlett, newly emerged from the chrysalis of widowhood,<br> all the war meant was a time of gaiety and excitement. Even the<br> small privations of clothing and food did not annoy her, so happy<br> was she to be in the world again.<br><br> When she thought of the dull times of the past year, with the days<br> going by one very much like another, life seemed to have quickened<br> to an incredible speed. Every day dawned as an exciting<br> adventure, a day in which she would meet new men who would ask to<br> call on her, tell her how pretty she was, and how it was a<br> privilege to fight and, perhaps, to die for her. She could and<br> did love Ashley with the last breath in her body, but that did not<br> prevent her from inveigling other men into asking to marry her.<br><br> The ever-present war in the background lent a pleasant informality<br> to social relations, an informality which older people viewed with<br> alarm. Mothers found strange men calling on their daughters, men<br> who came without letters of introduction and whose antecedents<br> were unknown. To their horror, mothers found their daughters<br> holding hands with these men. Mrs. Merriwether, who had never<br> kissed her husband until after the wedding ceremony, could<br> scarcely believe her eyes when she caught Maybelle kissing the<br> little Zouave, Rene Picard, and her consternation was even greater<br> when Maybelle refused to be ashamed. Even the fact that Rene<br> immediately asked for her hand did not improve matters. Mrs.<br> Merriwether felt that the South was heading for a complete moral<br> collapse and frequently said so. Other mothers concurred heartily<br> with her and blamed it on the war.<br><br> But men who expected to die within a week or a month could not<br> wait a year before they begged to call a girl by her first name,<br> with ‘Miss,’ of course, preceding it. Nor would they go through<br> the formal and protracted courtships which good manners had<br> prescribed before the war. They were likely to propose in three<br> or four months. And girls who knew very well that a lady always<br> refused a gentleman the first three times he proposed rushed<br> headlong to accept the first time.<br><br> This informality made the war a lot of fun for Scarlett. Except<br> for the messy business of nursing and the bore of bandage rolling,<br> she did not care if the war lasted forever. In fact, she could<br> endure the hospital with equanimity now because it was a perfect<br> happy hunting ground. The helpless wounded succumbed to her<br> charms without a struggle. Renew their bandages, wash their<br> faces, pat up their pillows and fan them, and they fell in love.<br> Oh, it was Heaven after the last dreary year!<br><br> Scarlett was back again where she had been before she married<br> Charles and it was as if she had never married him, never felt the<br> shock of his death, never borne Wade. War and marriage and<br> childbirth had passed over her without touching any deep chord<br> within her and she was unchanged. She had a child but he was<br> cared for so well by the others in the red brick house she could<br> almost forget him. In her mind and heart, she was Scarlett O'Hara<br> again, the belle of the County. Her thoughts and activities were<br> the same as they had been in the old days, but the field of her<br> activities had widened immensely. Careless of the disapproval of<br> Aunt Pitty's friends, she behaved as she had behaved before her<br> marriage, went to parties, danced, went riding with soldiers,<br> flirted, did everything she had done as a girl, except stop<br> wearing mourning. This she knew would be a straw that would break<br> the backs of Pittypat and Melanie. She was as charming a widow as<br> she had been a girl, pleasant when she had her own way, obliging<br> as long as it did not discommode her, vain of her looks and her<br> popularity.<br><br> She was happy now where a few weeks before she had been miserable,<br> happy with her beaux and their reassurances of her charm, as happy<br> as she could be with Ashley married to Melanie and in danger. But<br> somehow it was easier to bear the thought of Ashley belonging to<br> some one else when he was far away. With the hundreds of miles<br> stretching between Atlanta and Virginia, he sometimes seemed as<br> much hers as Melanie's.<br><br> So the autumn months of 1862 went swiftly by with nursing,<br> dancing, driving and bandage rolling taking up all the time she<br> did not spend on brief visits to Tara. These visits were<br> disappointing, for she had little opportunity for the long quiet<br> talks with her mother to which she looked forward while in<br> Atlanta, no time to sit by Ellen while she sewed, smelling the<br> faint fragrance of lemon verbena sachet as her skirts rustled,<br> feeling her soft hands on her cheek in a gentle caress.<br><br> Ellen was thin and preoccupied now and on her feet from morning<br> until long after the plantation was asleep. The demands of the<br> Confederate commissary were growing heavier by the month, and hers<br> was the task of making Tara produce. Even Gerald was busy, for<br> the first time in many years, for he could get no overseer to take<br> Jonas Wilkerson's place and he was riding his own acres. With<br> Ellen too busy for more than a goodnight kiss and Gerald in the<br> fields all day, Scarlett found Tara boring. Even her sisters were<br> taken up with their own concerns. Suellen had now come to an<br> ‘understanding’ with Frank Kennedy and sang ‘When This Cruel War<br> Is Over’ with an arch meaning Scarlett found well-nigh<br> unendurable, and Carreen was too wrapped up in dreams of Brent<br> Tarleton to be interesting company.<br><br> Though Scarlett always went home to Tara with a happy heart, she<br> was never sorry when the inevitable letters came from Pitty and<br> Melanie, begging her to return. Ellen always sighed at these<br> times, saddened by the thought of her oldest daughter and her only<br> grandchild leaving her.<br><br> ‘But I mustn't be selfish and keep you here when you are needed to<br> nurse in Atlanta,’ she said. ‘Only--only, my darling, it seems<br> that I never get the time to talk to you and to feel that you are<br> my own little girl again before you are gone from me.’<br><br> ‘I'm always your little girl,’ Scarlett would say and bury her<br> head upon Ellen's breast, her guilt rising up to accuse her. She<br> did not tell her mother that it was the dancing and the beaux<br> which drew her back to Atlanta and not the service of the<br> Confederacy. There were many things she kept from her mother<br> these days. But, most of all, she kept secret the fact that Rhett<br> Butler called frequently at Aunt Pittypat's house.<br><br> <br><br> During the months that followed the bazaar, Rhett called whenever<br> he was in town, taking Scarlett riding in his carriage, escorting<br> her to danceables and bazaars and waiting outside the hospital to<br> drive her home. She lost her fear of his betraying her secret,<br> but there always lurked in the back of her mind the disquieting<br> memory that he had seen her at her worst and knew the truth about<br> Ashley. It was this knowledge that checked her tongue when he<br> annoyed her. And he annoyed her frequently.<br><br> He was in his mid-thirties, older than any beau she had ever had,<br> and she was as helpless as a child to control and handle him as<br> she had handled beaux nearer her own age. He always looked as if<br> nothing had ever surprised him and much had amused him and, when<br> he had gotten her into a speechless temper, she felt that she<br> amused him more than anything in the world. Frequently she flared<br> into open wrath under his expert baiting, for she had Gerald's<br> Irish temper along with the deceptive sweetness of face she had<br> inherited from Ellen. Heretofore she had never bothered to<br> control her temper except in Ellen's presence. Now it was painful<br> to have to choke back words for fear of his amused grin. If only<br> he would ever lose his temper too, then she would not feel at such<br> a disadvantage.<br><br> After tilts with him from which she seldom emerged the victor she<br> vowed he was impossible, ill-bred and no gentleman and she would<br> have nothing more to do with him. But sooner or later, he<br> returned to Atlanta, called, presumably on Aunt Pitty, and<br> presented Scarlett, with overdone gallantry, a box of bonbons he<br> had brought her from Nassau. Or preempted a seat by her at a<br> musicale or claimed her at a dance, and she was usually so amused<br> by his bland impudence that she laughed and overlooked his past<br> misdeeds until the next occurred.<br><br> For all his exasperating qualities, she grew to look forward to<br> his calls. There was something exciting about him that she could<br> not analyze, something different from any man she had ever known.<br> There was something breathtaking in the grace of his big body<br> which made his very entrance into a room like an abrupt physical<br> impact, something in the impertinence and bland mockery of his<br> dark eyes that challenged her spirit to subdue him.<br><br> ‘It's almost like I was in love with him!’ she thought,<br> bewildered. ‘But I'm not and I just can't understand it.’<br><br> But the exciting feeling persisted. When he came to call, his<br> complete masculinity made Aunt Pitty's well-bred and ladylike<br> house seem small, pale and a trifle fusty. Scarlett was not the<br> only member of the household who reacted strangely and unwillingly<br> to his presence, for he kept Aunt Pitty in a flutter and a<br> ferment.<br><br> While Pitty knew Ellen would disapprove of his calls on her<br> daughter, and knew also that the edict of Charleston banning him<br> from polite society was not one to be lightly disregarded, she<br> could no more resist his elaborate compliments and hand kissing<br> than a fly can resist a honey pot. Moreover, he usually brought<br> her some little gift from Nassau which he assured her he had<br> purchased especially for her and blockaded in at risk of his life--<br> papers of pins and needles, buttons, spools of silk thread and<br> hairpins. It was almost impossible to obtain these small luxuries<br> now--ladies were wearing hand-whittled wooden hairpins and<br> covering acorns with cloth for buttons--and Pitty lacked the moral<br> stamina to refuse them. Besides, she had a childish love of<br> surprise packages and could not resist opening his gifts. And,<br> having once opened them, she did not feel that she could refuse<br> them. Then, having accepted his gifts, she could not summon<br> courage enough to tell him his reputation made it improper for him<br> to call on three lone women who had no male protector. Aunt Pitty<br> always felt that she needed a male protector when Rhett Butler was<br> in the house.<br><br> ‘I don't know what it is about him,’ she would sigh helplessly.<br> ‘But--well, I think he'd be a nice, attractive man if I could just<br> feel that--well, that deep down in his heart he respected women.’<br><br> Since the return of her wedding ring, Melanie had felt that Rhett<br> was a gentleman of rare refinement and delicacy and she was<br> shocked at this remark. He was unfailingly courteous to her, but<br> she was a little timid with him, largely because she was shy with<br> any man she had not known from childhood. Secretly she was very<br> sorry for him, a feeling which would have amused him had he been<br> aware of it. She was certain that some romantic sorrow had<br> blighted his life and made him hard and bitter, and she felt that<br> what he needed was the love of a good woman. In all her sheltered<br> life she had never seen evil and could scarcely credit its<br> existence, and when gossip whispered things about Rhett and the<br> girl in Charleston she was shocked and unbelieving. And, instead<br> of turning her against him, it only made her more timidly gracious<br> toward him because of her indignation at what she fancied was a<br> gross injustice done him.<br><br> Scarlett silently agreed with Aunt Pitty. She, too, felt that he<br> had no respect for any woman, unless perhaps for Melanie. She<br> still felt unclothed every time his eyes ran up and down her<br> figure. It was not that he ever said anything. Then she could<br> have scorched him with hot words. It was the bold way his eyes<br> looked out of his swarthy face with a displeasing air of<br> insolence, as if all women were his property to be enjoyed in his<br> own good time. Only with Melanie was this look absent. There was<br> never that cool look of appraisal, never mockery in his eyes, when<br> he looked at Melanie; and there was an especial note in his voice<br> when he spoke to her, courteous, respectful, anxious to be of<br> service.<br><br> ‘I don't see why you're so much nicer to her than to me,’ said<br> Scarlett petulantly, one afternoon when Melanie and Pitty had<br> retired to take their naps and she was alone with him.<br><br> For an hour she had watched Rhett hold the yarn Melanie was<br> winding for knitting, had noted the blank inscrutable expression<br> when Melanie talked at length and with pride of Ashley and his<br> promotion. Scarlett knew Rhett had no exalted opinion of Ashley<br> and cared nothing at all about the fact that he had been made a<br> major. Yet he made polite replies and murmured the correct things<br> about Ashley's gallantry.<br><br> And if I so much as mention Ashley's name, she had thought<br> irritably, he cocks his eyebrow up and smiles that nasty, knowing<br> smile!<br><br> ‘I'm much prettier than she is,’ she continued, ‘and I don't see<br> why you're nicer to her.’<br><br> ‘Dare I hope that you are jealous?’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't presume!’<br><br> ‘Another hope crushed. If I am 'nicer' to Mrs. Wilkes, it is<br> because she deserves it. She is one of the very few kind, sincere<br> and unselfish persons I have ever known. But perhaps you have<br> failed to note these qualities. And moreover, for all her youth,<br> she is one of the few great ladies I have ever been privileged to<br> know.’<br><br> ‘Do you mean to say you don't think I'm a great lady, too?’<br><br> ‘I think we agreed on the occasion of our first meeting that you<br> were no lady at all.’<br><br> ‘Oh, if you are going to be hateful and rude enough to bring that<br> up again! How can you hold that bit of childish temper against<br> me? That was so long ago and I've grown up since then and I'd<br> forget all about it if you weren't always harping and hinting<br> about it.’<br><br> ‘I don't think it was childish temper and I don't believe you've<br> changed. You are just as capable now as then of throwing vases if<br> you don't get your own way. But you usually get your way now.<br> And so there's no necessity for broken bric-a-brac.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you are--I wish I was a man! I'd call you out and--’<br><br> ‘And get killed for your pains. I can drill a dime at fifty<br> yards. Better stick to your own weapons--dimples, vases and the<br> like.’<br><br> ‘You are just a rascal.’<br><br> ‘Do you expect me to fly into a rage at that? I am sorry to<br> disappoint you. You can't make me mad by calling me names that are<br> true. Certainly I'm a rascal, and why not? It's a free country and<br> a man may be a rascal if he chooses. It's only hypocrites like you,<br> my dear lady, just as black at heart but trying to hide it, who<br> become enraged when called by their right names.’<br><br> She was helpless before his calm smile and his drawling remarks,<br> for she had never before met anyone who was so completely<br> impregnable. Her weapons of scorn, coldness and abuse blunted<br> in her hands, for nothing she could say would shame him. It had<br> been her experience that the liar was the hottest to defend his<br> veracity, the coward his courage, the ill-bred his gentlemanliness,<br> and the cad his honor. But not Rhett. He admitted everything and<br> laughed and dared her to say more.<br><br> He came and went during these months, arriving unheralded and<br> leaving without saying good-by. Scarlett never discovered just<br> what business brought him to Atlanta, for few other blockaders<br> found it necessary to come so far away from the coast. They<br> landed their cargoes at Wilmington or Charleston, where they were<br> met by swarms of merchants and speculators from all over the South<br> who assembled to buy blockaded goods at auction. It would have<br> pleased her to think that he made these trips to see her, but even<br> her abnormal vanity refused to believe this. If he had ever once<br> made love to her, seemed jealous of the other men who crowded<br> about her, even tried to hold her hand or begged for a picture or<br> a handkerchief to cherish, she would have thought triumphantly he<br> had been caught by her charms. But he remained annoyingly<br> unloverlike and, worst of all, seemed to see through all her<br> maneuverings to bring him to his knees.<br><br> Whenever he came to town, there was a feminine fluttering. Not<br> only did the romantic aura of the dashing blockader hang about him<br> but there was also the titillating element of the wicked and the<br> forbidden. He had such a bad reputation! And every time the<br> matrons of Atlanta gathered together to gossip, his reputation<br> grew worse, which only made him all the more glamorous to the<br> young girls. As most of them were quite innocent, they had heard<br> little more than that he was ‘quite loose with women’--and exactly<br> how a man went about the business of being ‘loose’ they did not<br> know. They also heard whispers that no girl was safe with him.<br> With such a reputation, it was strange that he had never so much<br> as kissed the hand of an unmarried girl since he first appeared in<br> Atlanta. But that only served to make him more mysterious and<br> more exciting.<br><br> Outside of the army heroes, he was the most talked-about man in<br> Atlanta. Everyone knew in detail how he had been expelled from<br> West Point for drunkenness and ‘something about women.’ That<br> terrific scandal concerning the Charleston girl he had compromised<br> and the brother he had killed was public property. Correspondence<br> with Charleston friends elicited the further information that his<br> father, a charming old gentleman with an iron will and a ramrod<br> for a backbone, had cast him out without a penny when he was<br> twenty and even stricken his name from the family Bible. After<br> that he had wandered to California in the gold rush of 1849 and<br> thence to South America and Cuba, and the reports of his<br> activities in these parts were none too savory. Scrapes about<br> women, several shootings, gun running to the revolutionists in<br> Central America and, worst of all, professional gambling were<br> included in his career, as Atlanta heard it.<br><br> There was hardly a family in Georgia who could not own to their<br> sorrow at least one male member or relative who gambled, losing<br> money, houses, land and slaves. But that was different. A man<br> could gamble himself to poverty and still be a gentleman, but a<br> professional gambler could never be anything but an outcast.<br><br> Had it not been for the upset conditions due to the war and his<br> own services to the Confederate government, Rhett Butler would<br> never have been received in Atlanta. But now, even the most<br> strait laced felt that patriotism called upon them to be more<br> broad minded. The more sentimental were inclined to view that the<br> black sheep of the Butler family had repented of his evil ways and<br> was making an attempt to atone for his sins. So the ladies felt<br> in duty bound to stretch a point, especially in the case of so<br> intrepid a blockader. Everyone knew now that the fate of the<br> Confederacy rested as much upon the skill of the blockade boats in<br> eluding the Yankee fleet as it did upon the soldiers at the front.<br><br> Rumor had it that Captain Butler was one of the best pilots in the<br> South and that he was reckless and utterly without nerves. Reared<br> in Charleston, he knew every inlet, creek, shoal and rock of the<br> Carolina coast near that port, and he was equally at home in the<br> waters around Wilmington. He had never lost a boat or even been<br> forced to dump a cargo. At the onset of the war, he had emerged<br> from obscurity with enough money to buy a small swift boat and<br> now, when blockaded goods realized two thousand per cent on each<br> cargo, he owned four boats. He had good pilots and paid them<br> well, and they slid out of Charleston and Wilmington on dark<br> nights, bearing cotton for Nassau, England and Canada. The cotton<br> mills of England were standing idle and the workers were starving,<br> and any blockader who could outwit the Yankee fleet could command<br> his own price in Liverpool. Rhett's boats were singularly lucky<br> both in taking out cotton for the Confederacy and bringing in the<br> war materials for which the South was desperate. Yes, the ladies<br> felt they could forgive and forget a great many things for such a<br> brave man.<br><br> He was a dashing figure and one that people turned to look at. He<br> spent money freely, rode a wild black stallion, and wore clothes<br> which were always the height of style and tailoring. The latter<br> in itself was enough to attract attention to him, for the uniforms<br> of the soldiers were dingy and worn now and the civilians, even<br> when turned out in their best, showed skillful patching and<br> darning. Scarlett thought she had never seen such elegant pants<br> as he wore, fawn colored, shepherd's plaid, and checked. As for<br> his waistcoats, they were indescribably handsome, especially the<br> white watered-silk one with tiny pink rosebuds embroidered on it.<br> And he wore these garments with a still more elegant air as though<br> unaware of their glory.<br><br> There were few ladies who could resist his charms when he chose to<br> exert them, and finally even Mrs. Merriwether unbent and invited<br> him to Sunday dinner.<br><br> Maybelle Merriwether was to marry her little Zouave when he got<br> his next furlough, and she cried every time she thought of it, for<br> she had set her heart on marrying in a white satin dress and there<br> was no white satin in the Confederacy. Nor could she borrow a<br> dress, for the satin wedding dresses of years past had all gone<br> into the making of battle flags. Useless for the patriotic Mrs.<br> Merriwether to upbraid her daughter and point out that homespun<br> was the proper bridal attire for a Confederate bride. Maybelle<br> wanted satin. She was willing, even proud to go without hairpins<br> and buttons and nice shoes and candy and tea for the sake of the<br> Cause, but she wanted a satin wedding dress.<br><br> Rhett, hearing of this from Melanie, brought in from England yards<br> and yards of gleaming white satin and a lace veil and presented<br> them to her as a wedding gift. He did it in such a way that it<br> was unthinkable to even mention paying him for them, and Maybelle<br> was so delighted she almost kissed him. Mrs. Merriwether knew<br> that so expensive a gift--and a gift of clothing at that--was<br> highly improper, but she could think of no way of refusing when<br> Rhett told her in the most florid language that nothing was too<br> good to deck the bride of one of our brave heroes. So Mrs.<br> Merriwether invited him to dinner, feeling that this concession<br> more than paid for the gift.<br><br> He not only brought Maybelle the satin but he was able to give<br> excellent hints on the making of the wedding dress. Hoops in<br> Paris were wider this season and skirts were shorter. They were<br> no longer ruffled but were gathered up in scalloped festoons,<br> showing braided petticoats beneath. He said, too, that he had<br> seen no pantalets on the streets, so he imagined they were ‘out.’<br> Afterwards, Mrs. Merriwether told Mrs. Elsing she feared that if<br> she had given him any encouragement at all, he would have told her<br> exactly what kind of drawers were being worn by Parisiennes.<br><br> Had he been less obviously masculine, his ability to recall<br> details of dresses, bonnets and coiffures would have been put down<br> as the rankest effeminacy. The ladies always felt a little odd<br> when they besieged him with questions about styles, but they did<br> it nevertheless. They were as isolated from the world of fashion<br> as shipwrecked mariners, for few books of fashion came through the<br> blockade. For all they knew the ladies of France might be shaving<br> their heads and wearing coonskin caps, so Rhett's memory for<br> furbelows was an excellent substitute for Godey's Lady's Book. He<br> could and did notice details so dear to feminine hearts, and after<br> each trip abroad he could be found in the center of a group of<br> ladies, telling that bonnets were smaller this year and perched<br> higher, covering most of the top of the head, that plumes and not<br> flowers were being used to trim them, that the Empress of France<br> had abandoned the chignon for evening wear and had her hair piled<br> almost on the top of her head, showing all of her ears, and that<br> evening frocks were shockingly low again.<br><br> <br><br> For some months, he was the most popular and romantic figure the<br> town knew, despite his previous reputation, despite the faint<br> rumors that he was engaged not only in blockading but in<br> speculating on foodstuffs, too. People who did not like him said<br> that after every trip he made to Atlanta, prices jumped five<br> dollars. But even with this under-cover gossip seeping about, he<br> could have retained his popularity had he considered it worth<br> retaining. Instead, it seemed as though, after trying the company<br> of the staid and patriotic citizens and winning their respect and<br> grudging liking, something perverse in him made him go out of his<br> way to affront them and show them that his conduct had been only a<br> masquerade and one which no longer amused him.<br><br> It was as though he bore an impersonal contempt for everyone and<br> everything in the South, the Confederacy in particular, and took<br> no pains to conceal it. It was his remarks about the Confederacy<br> that made Atlanta look at him first in bewilderment, then coolly<br> and then with hot rage. Even before 1862 passed into 1863, men<br> were bowing to him with studied frigidity and women beginning to<br> draw their daughters to their sides when he appeared at a<br> gathering.<br><br> He seemed to take pleasure not only in affronting the sincere and<br> red-hot loyalties of Atlanta but in presenting himself in the<br> worst possible light. When well-meaning people complimented him<br> on his bravery in running the blockade, he blandly replied that he<br> was always frightened when in danger, as frightened as were the<br> brave boys at the front. Everyone knew there had never been a<br> cowardly Confederate soldier and they found this statement<br> peculiarly irritating. He always referred to the soldiers as ‘our<br> brave boys’ and ‘our heroes in gray’ and did it in such a way as<br> to convey the utmost in insult. When daring young ladies, hoping<br> for a flirtation, thanked him for being one of the heroes who<br> fought for them, he bowed and declared that such was not the case,<br> for he would do the same thing for Yankee women if the same amount<br> of money were involved.<br><br> Since Scarlett's first meeting with him in Atlanta on the night of<br> the bazaar, he had talked with her in this manner, but now there<br> was a thinly veiled note of mockery in his conversations with<br> everyone. When praised for his services to the Confederacy, he<br> unfailingly replied that blockading was a business with him. If<br> he could make as much money out of government contracts, he would<br> say, picking out with his eyes those who had government contracts,<br> then he would certainly abandon the hazards of blockading and take<br> to selling shoddy cloth, sanded sugar, spoiled flour and rotten<br> leather to the Confederacy.<br><br> Most of his remarks were unanswerable, which made them all the<br> worse. There had already been minor scandals about those holding<br> government contracts. Letters from men at the front complained<br> constantly of shoes that wore out in a week, gunpowder that would<br> not ignite, harness that snapped at any strain, meat that was<br> rotten and flour that was full of weevils. Atlanta people tried<br> to think that the men who sold such stuff to the government must<br> be contract holders from Alabama or Virginia or Tennessee, and not<br> Georgians. For did not the Georgia contract holders include men<br> from the very best families? Were they not the first to<br> contribute to the hospital funds and to the aid of soldiers'<br> orphans? Were they not the first to cheer at ‘Dixie’ and the most<br> rampant seekers, in oratory at least, for Yankee blood? The full<br> tide of fury against those profiteering on government contracts<br> had not yet risen, and Rhett's words were taken merely as evidence<br> of his own bad breeding.<br><br> He not only affronted the town with insinuations of venality on<br> the part of men in high places and slurs on the courage of the men<br> in the field, but he took pleasure in tricking the dignified<br> citizenry into embarrassing situations. He could no more resist<br> pricking the conceits, the hypocrisies and the flamboyant<br> patriotism of those about him than a small boy can resist putting<br> a pin into a balloon. He neatly deflated the pompous and exposed<br> the ignorant and the bigoted, and he did it in such subtle ways,<br> drawing his victims out by his seemingly courteous interest, that<br> they never were quite certain what had happened until they stood<br> exposed as windy, high flown and slightly ridiculous.<br><br> During the months when the town accepted him, Scarlett had been<br> under no illusions about him. She knew that his elaborate<br> gallantries and his florid speeches were all done with his tongue<br> in his cheek. She knew that he was acting the part of the dashing<br> and patriotic blockade runner simply because it amused him.<br> Sometimes he seemed to her like the County boys with whom she had<br> grown up, the wild Tarleton twins with their obsession for practical<br> jokes; the devil-inspired Fontaines, teasing, mischievous; the<br> Calverts who would sit up all night planning hoaxes. But there was<br> a difference, for beneath Rhett's seeming lightness there was<br> something malicious, almost sinister in its suave brutality.<br><br> Though she was thoroughly aware of his insincerity, she much<br> preferred him in the role of the romantic blockader. For one<br> thing, it made her own situation in associating with him so much<br> easier than it had been at first. So, she was intensely annoyed<br> when he dropped his masquerade and set out apparently upon a<br> deliberate campaign to alienate Atlanta's good will. It annoyed<br> her because it seemed foolish and also because some of the harsh<br> criticism directed at him fell on her.<br><br> It was at Mrs. Elsing's silver musicale for the benefit of the<br> convalescents that Rhett signed his final warrant of ostracism.<br> That afternoon the Elsing home was crowded with soldiers on leave<br> and men from the hospitals, members of the Home Guard and the<br> militia unit, and matrons, widows and young girls. Every chair in<br> the house was occupied, and even the long winding stair was packed<br> with guests. The large cut-glass bowl held at the door by the<br> Elsings' butler had been emptied twice of its burden of silver<br> coins. That in itself was enough to make the affair a success,<br> for now a dollar in silver was worth sixty dollars in Confederate<br> paper money.<br><br> Every girl with any pretense to accomplishments had sung or played<br> the piano, and the tableaux vivants had been greeted with<br> flattering applause. Scarlett was much pleased with herself, for<br> not only had she and Melanie rendered a touching duet, ‘When the<br> Dew Is on the Blossom,’ followed as an encore by the more<br> sprightly ‘Oh, Lawd, Ladies, Don't Mind Stephen!’ but she had also<br> been chosen to represent the Spirit of the Confederacy in the last<br> tableau.<br><br> She had looked most fetching, wearing a modestly draped Greek robe<br> of white cheesecloth girdled with red and blue and holding the<br> Stars and Bars in one hand, while with the other she stretched out<br> to the kneeling Captain Carey Ashburn, of Alabama, the gold-hilted<br> saber which had belonged to Charles and his father.<br><br> When her tableau was over, she could not help seeking Rhett's eyes<br> to see if he had appreciated the pretty picture she made. With a<br> feeling of exasperation she saw that he was in an argument and<br> probably had not even noticed her. Scarlett could see by the<br> faces of the group surrounding him that they were infuriated by<br> what he was saying.<br><br> She made her way toward them and, in one of those odd silences<br> which sometimes fall on a gathering, she heard Willie Guinan, of<br> the militia outfit, say plainly: ‘Do I understand, sir, that you<br> mean the Cause for which our heroes have died is not sacred?’<br><br> ‘If you were run over by a railroad train your death wouldn't<br> sanctify the railroad company, would it?’ asked Rhett and his<br> voice sounded as if he were humbly seeking information.<br><br> ‘Sir,’ said Willie, his voice shaking, ‘if we were not under this<br> roof--’<br><br> ‘I tremble to think what would happen,’ said Rhett. ‘For, of<br> course, your bravery is too well known.’<br><br> Willie went scarlet and all conversation ceased. Everyone was<br> embarrassed. Willie was strong and healthy and of military age<br> and yet he wasn't at the front. Of course, he was the only boy<br> his mother had and, after all, somebody had to be in the militia<br> to protect the state. But there were a few irreverent snickers<br> from convalescent officers when Rhett spoke of bravery.<br><br> ‘Oh, why doesn't he keep his mouth shut!’ thought Scarlett<br> indignantly. ‘He's simply spoiling the whole party!’<br><br> Dr. Meade's brows were thunderous.<br><br> ‘Nothing may be sacred to you, young man,’ he said, in the voice<br> he always used when making speeches. ‘But there are many things<br> sacred to the patriotic men and ladies of the South. And the<br> freedom of our land from the usurper is one and States' Rights is<br> another and--’<br><br> Rhett looked lazy and his voice had a silky, almost bored, note.<br><br> ‘All wars are sacred,’ he said. ‘To those who have to fight them.<br> If the people who started wars didn't make them sacred, who would<br> be foolish enough to fight? But, no matter what rallying cries<br> the orators give to the idiots who fight, no matter what noble<br> purposes they assign to wars, there is never but one reason for a<br> war. And that is money. All wars are in reality money squabbles.<br> But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of<br> bugles and drums and the fine words from stay-at-home orators.<br> Sometimes the rallying cry is 'Save the Tomb of Christ from the<br> Heathen!' Sometimes it's 'Down with Popery!' and sometimes<br> 'Liberty!' and sometimes 'Cotton, Slavery and States' Rights!'‘<br><br> ‘What on earth has the Pope to do with it?’ thought Scarlett. ‘Or<br> Christ's tomb, either?’<br><br> But as she hurried toward the incensed group, she saw Rhett bow<br> jauntily and start toward the doorway through the crowd. She<br> started after him but Mrs. Elsing caught her skirt and held her.<br><br> ‘Let him go,’ she said in a clear voice that carried throughout<br> the tensely quiet room. ‘Let him go. He is a traitor, a<br> speculator! He is a viper that we have nursed to our bosoms!’<br><br> Rhett, standing in the hall, his hat in his hand, heard as he was<br> intended to hear and, turning, surveyed the room for a moment. He<br> looked pointedly at Mrs. Elsing's flat bosom, grinned suddenly<br> and, bowing, made his exit.<br><br> <br><br> Mrs. Merriwether rode home in Aunt Pitty's carriage, and scarcely<br> had the four ladies seated themselves when she exploded.<br><br> ‘There now, Pittypat Hamilton! I hope you are satisfied!’<br><br> ‘With what?’ cried Pitty, apprehensively.<br><br> ‘With the conduct of that wretched Butler man you've been<br> harboring.’<br><br> Pittypat fluttered, too upset by the accusation to recall that<br> Mrs. Merriwether had also been Rhett Butler's hostess on several<br> occasions. Scarlett and Melanie thought of this, but bred to<br> politeness to their elders, refrained from remarking on the<br> matter. Instead they studiously looked down at their mittened<br> hands.<br><br> ‘He insulted us all and the Confederacy too,’ said Mrs. Merriwether,<br> and her stout bust heaved violently beneath its glittering<br> passementerie trimmings. ‘Saying that we were fighting for money!<br> Saying that our leaders had lied to us! He should be put in jail.<br> Yes, he should. I shall speak to Dr. Meade about it. If Mr.<br> Merriwether were only alive, he'd tend to him! Now, Pitty Hamilton,<br> you listen to me. You mustn't ever let that scamp come into your<br> house again!’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ mumbled Pitty, helplessly, looking as if she wished she were<br> dead. She looked appealingly at the two girls who kept their eyes<br> cast down and then hopefully toward Uncle Peter's erect back. She<br> knew he was listening attentively to every word and she hoped he<br> would turn and take a hand in the conversation, as he frequently<br> did. She hoped he would say: ‘Now, Miss Dolly, you let Miss<br> Pitty be,’ but Peter made no move. He disapproved heartily of<br> Rhett Butler and poor Pitty knew it. She sighed and said: ‘Well,<br> Dolly, if you think--’<br><br> ‘I do think,’ returned Mrs. Merriwether firmly. ‘I can't imagine<br> what possessed you to receive him in the first place. After this<br> afternoon, there won't be a decent home in town that he'll be<br> welcome in. Do get up some gumption and forbid him your house.’<br><br> She turned a sharp eye on the girls. ‘I hope you two are marking<br> my words,’ she continued, ‘for it's partly your fault, being so<br> pleasant to him. Just tell him politely but firmly that his<br> presence and his disloyal talk are distinctly unwelcome at your<br> house.’<br><br> By this time Scarlett was boiling, ready to rear like a horse at<br> the touch of a strange rough hand on its bridle. But she was<br> afraid to speak. She could not risk Mrs. Merriwether writing<br> another letter to her mother.<br><br> ‘You old buffalo!’ she thought, her face crimson with suppressed<br> fury. ‘How heavenly it would be to tell you just what I think of<br> you and your bossy ways!’<br><br> ‘I never thought to live long enough to hear such disloyal words<br> spoken of our Cause,’ went on Mrs. Merriwether, by this time in a<br> ferment of righteous anger. ‘Any man who does not think our Cause<br> is just and holy should be hanged! I don't want to hear of you<br> two girls ever even speaking to him again-- For Heaven's sake,<br> Melly, what ails you?’<br><br> Melanie was white and her eyes were enormous.<br><br> ‘I will speak to him again,’ she said in a low voice. ‘I will not<br> be rude to him. I will not forbid him the house.’<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether's breath went out of her lungs as explosively as<br> though she had been punched. Aunt Pitty's fat mouth popped open<br> and Uncle Peter turned to stare.<br><br> ‘Now, why didn't I have the gumption to say that?’ thought<br> Scarlett, jealousy mixing with admiration. ‘How did that little<br> rabbit ever get up spunk enough to stand up to old lady<br> Merriwether?’<br><br> Melanie's hands were shaking but she went on hurriedly, as though<br> fearing her courage would fail her if she delayed.<br><br> ‘I won't be rude to him because of what he said, because-- It was<br> rude of him to say it out loud--most ill advised--but it's--it's<br> what Ashley thinks. And I can't forbid the house to a man who<br> thinks what my husband thinks. It would be unjust.’<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether's breath had come back and she charged.<br><br> ‘Melly Hamilton, I never heard such a lie in all my life! There<br> was never a Wilkes who was a coward--’<br><br> ‘I never said Ashley was a coward,’ said Melanie, her eyes<br> beginning to flash. ‘I said he thinks what Captain Butler thinks,<br> only he expresses it in different words. And he doesn't go around<br> saying it at musicales, I hope. But he has written it to me.’<br><br> Scarlett's guilty conscience stirred as she tried to recall what<br> Ashley might have written that would lead Melanie to make such a<br> statement, but most of the letters she had read had gone out of<br> her head as soon as she finished reading them. She believed<br> Melanie had simply taken leave of her senses.<br><br> ‘Ashley wrote me that we should not be fighting the Yankees. And<br> that we have been betrayed into it by statesmen and orators<br> mouthing catchwords and prejudices,’ said Melly rapidly. ‘He said<br> nothing in the world was worth what this war was going to do to<br> us. He said here wasn't anything at all to glory--it was just<br> misery and dirt.’<br><br> ‘Oh! That letter,’ thought Scarlett. ‘Was that what he meant?’<br><br> ‘I don't believe it,’ said Mrs. Merriwether firmly. ‘You<br> misunderstood his meaning.’<br><br> ‘I never misunderstand Ashley,’ Melanie replied quietly, though<br> her lips were trembling. ‘I understand him perfectly. He meant<br> exactly what Captain Butler meant, only he didn't say it in a rude<br> way.’<br><br> ‘You should be ashamed of yourself, comparing a fine man like<br> Ashley Wilkes to a scoundrel like Captain Butler! I suppose you,<br> too, think the Cause is nothing!’<br><br> ‘I--I don't know what I think,’ Melanie began uncertainly, her<br> fire deserting her and panic at her outspokenness taking hold of<br> her. ‘I--I'd die for the Cause, like Ashley would. But--I mean--<br> I mean, I'll let the men folks do the thinking, because they are<br> so much smarter.’<br><br> ‘I never heard the like,’ snorted Mrs. Merriwether. ‘Stop, Uncle<br> Peter, you're driving past my house!’<br><br> Uncle Peter, preoccupied with the conversation behind him, had<br> driven past the Merriwether carriage block and he backed up the<br> horse. Mrs. Merriwether alighted, her bonnet ribbons shaking like<br> sails in a storm.<br><br> ‘You'll be sorry,’ she said.<br><br> Uncle Peter whipped up the horse.<br><br> ‘You young misses ought ter tek shame, gittin' Miss Pitty in a<br> state,’ he scolded.<br><br> ‘I'm not in a state,’ replied Pitty, surprisingly, for less strain<br> than this had frequently brought on fainting fits. ‘Melly, honey,<br> I knew you were doing it just to take up for me and, really, I was<br> glad to see somebody take Dolly down a peg. She's so bossy. How<br> did you have the courage? But do you think you should have said<br> that about Ashley?’<br><br> ‘But it's true,’ answered Melanie and she began to cry softly.<br> ‘And I'm not ashamed that he thinks that way. He thinks the war<br> is all wrong but he's willing to fight and die anyway, and that<br> takes lots more courage than fighting for something you think is<br> right.’<br><br> ‘Lawd, Miss Melly, doan cry hyah on Peachtree Street,’ groaned<br> Uncle Peter, hastening his horse's pace. ‘Folks'll talk sumpin'<br> scan'lous. Wait till us gits home.’<br><br> Scarlett said nothing. She did not even squeeze the hand that<br> Melanie had inserted into her palm for comfort. She had read<br> Ashley's letters for only one purpose--to assure herself that he<br> still loved her. Now Melanie had given a new meaning to passages<br> in the letters which Scarlett's eyes had barely seen. It shocked<br> her to realize that anyone as absolutely perfect as Ashley could<br> have any thought in common with such a reprobate as Rhett Butler.<br> She thought: ‘They both see the truth of this war, but Ashley is<br> willing to die about it and Rhett isn't. I think that shows<br> Rhett's good sense.’ She paused a moment, horror struck that she<br> could have such a thought about Ashley. ‘They both see the same<br> unpleasant truth, but Rhett likes to look it in the face and<br> enrage people by talking about it--and Ashley can hardly bear to<br> face it.’<br><br> It was very bewildering.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XIII<br><br> <br> Under Mrs. Merriwether's goading, Dr. Meade took action, in the<br> form of a letter to the newspaper wherein he did not mention Rhett<br> by name, though his meaning was obvious. The editor, sensing the<br> social drama of the letter, put it on the second page of the<br> paper, in itself a startling innovation, as the first two pages of<br> the paper were always devoted to advertisements of slaves, mules,<br> plows, coffins, houses for sale or rent, cures for private<br> diseases, abortifacients and restoratives for lost manhood.<br><br> The doctor's letter was the first of a chorus of indignation that<br> was beginning to be heard all over the South against speculators,<br> profiteers and holders of government contracts. Conditions in<br> Wilmington, the chief blockade port, now that Charleston's port<br> was practically sealed by the Yankee gunboats, had reached the<br> proportions of an open scandal. Speculators swarmed Wilmington<br> and, having the ready cash, bought up boatloads of goods and held<br> them for a rise in prices. The rise always came, for with the<br> increasing scarcity of necessities, prices leaped higher by the<br> month. The civilian population had either to do without or buy at<br> the speculators' prices, and the poor and those in moderate<br> circumstances were suffering increasing hardships. With the rise<br> in prices, Confederate money sank, and with its rapid fall there<br> rose a wild passion for luxuries. Blockaders were commissioned to<br> bring in necessities but now it was the higher-priced luxuries<br> that filled their boats to the exclusion of the things the<br> Confederacy vitally needed. People frenziedly bought these<br> luxuries with the money they had today, fearing that tomorrow's<br> prices would be higher and the money worthless.<br><br> To make matters worse, there was only one railroad line from<br> Wilmington to Richmond and, while thousands of barrels of flour<br> and boxes of bacon spoiled and rotted in wayside stations for want<br> of transportation, speculators with wines, taffetas and coffee to<br> sell seemed always able to get their goods to Richmond two days<br> after they were landed at Wilmington.<br><br> The rumor which had been creeping about underground was now being<br> openly discussed, that Rhett Butler not only ran his own four<br> boats and sold the cargoes at unheard-of prices but bought up the<br> cargoes of other boats and held them for rises in prices. It was<br> said that he was at the head of a combine worth more than a<br> million dollars, with Wilmington as its headquarters for the<br> purpose of buying blockade goods on the docks. They had dozens of<br> warehouses in that city and in Richmond, so the story ran, and the<br> warehouses were crammed with food and clothing that were being<br> held for higher prices. Already soldiers and civilians alike were<br> feeling the pinch, and the muttering against him and his fellow<br> speculators was bitter.<br><br> ‘There are many brave and patriotic men in the blockade arm of the<br> Confederacy's naval service,’ ran the last of the doctor's letter,<br> ‘unselfish men who are risking their lives and all their wealth<br> that the Confederacy may survive. They are enshrined in the<br> hearts of all loyal Southerners, and no one begrudges them the<br> scant monetary returns they make for their risks. They are<br> unselfish gentlemen, and we honor them. Of these men, I do not<br> speak.<br><br> ‘But there are other scoundrels who masquerade under the cloak of<br> the blockader for their own selfish gains, and I call down the<br> just wrath and vengeance of an embattled people, fighting in the<br> justest of Causes, on these human vultures who bring in satins and<br> laces when our men are dying for want of quinine, who load their<br> boats with tea and wines when our heroes are writhing for lack of<br> morphia. I execrate these vampires who are sucking the lifeblood<br> of the men who follow Robert Lee--these men who are making the<br> very name of blockader a stench in the nostrils of all patriotic<br> men. How can we endure these scavengers in our midst with their<br> varnished boots when our boys are tramping barefoot into battle?<br> How can we tolerate them with their champagnes and their pates of<br> Strasbourg when our soldiers are shivering about their camp fires<br> and gnawing moldy bacon? I call upon every loyal Confederate to<br> cast them out.’<br><br> Atlanta read, knew the oracle had spoken, and, as loyal<br> Confederates, they hastened to cast Rhett out.<br><br> Of all the homes which had received him in the fall of 1862, Miss<br> Pittypat's was almost the only one into which he could enter in<br> 1863. And, except for Melanie, he probably would not have been<br> received there. Aunt Pitty was in a state whenever he was in<br> town. She knew very well what her friends were saying when she<br> permitted him to call but she still lacked the courage to tell him<br> he was unwelcome. Each time he arrived in Atlanta, she set her<br> fat mouth and told the girls that she would meet him at the door<br> and forbid him to enter. And each time he came, a little package<br> in his hand and a compliment for her charm and beauty on his lips,<br> she wilted.<br><br> ‘I just don't know what to do,’ she would moan. ‘He just looks at<br> me and I--I'm scared to death of what he would do if I told him.<br> He's got such a bad reputation. Do you suppose he would strike<br> me--or--or-- Oh, dear, if Charlie were only alive! Scarlett, YOU<br> must tell him not to call again--tell him in a nice way. Oh, me!<br> I do believe you encourage him, and the whole town is talking and,<br> if your mother ever finds out, what will she say to me? Melly,<br> you must not be so nice to him. Be cool and distant and he will<br> understand. Oh, Melly, do you think I'd better write Henry a note<br> and ask him to speak to Captain Butler?’<br><br> ‘No, I don't,’ said Melanie. ‘And I won't be rude to him, either.<br> I think people are acting like chickens with their heads off about<br> Captain Butler. I'm sure he can't be all the bad things Dr. Meade<br> and Mrs. Merriwether say he is. He wouldn't hold food from<br> starving people. Why, he even gave me a hundred dollars for the<br> orphans. I'm sure he's just as loyal and patriotic as any of us<br> and he's just too proud to defend himself. You know how obstinate<br> men are when they get their backs up.’<br><br> Aunt Pitty knew nothing about men, either with their backs up or<br> otherwise, and she could only wave her fat little hands<br> helplessly. As for Scarlett, she had long ago become resigned to<br> Melanie's habit of seeing good in everyone. Melanie was a fool,<br> but there was nothing anybody could do about it.<br><br> Scarlett knew that Rhett was not being patriotic and, though she<br> would have died rather than confess it, she did not care. The<br> little presents he brought her from Nassau, little oddments that a<br> lady could accept with propriety, were what mattered most to her.<br> With prices as high as they were, where on earth could she get<br> needles and bonbons and hairpins, if she forbade the house to him?<br> No, it was easier to shift the responsibility to Aunt Pitty, who<br> after all was the head of the house, the chaperon and the arbiter<br> of morals. Scarlett knew the town gossiped about Rhett's calls,<br> and about her too; but she also knew that in the eyes of Atlanta<br> Melanie Wilkes could do no wrong, and if Melanie defended Rhett<br> his calls were still tinged with respectability.<br><br> However, life would be pleasanter if Rhett would recant his<br> heresies. She wouldn't have to suffer the embarrassment of seeing<br> him cut openly when she walked down Peachtree Street with him.<br><br> ‘Even if you think such things, why do you say them?’ she scolded.<br> ‘If you'd just think what you please but keep your mouth shut,<br> everything would be so much nicer.’<br><br> ‘That's your system, isn't it, my green-eyed hypocrite? Scarlett,<br> Scarlett! I hoped for more courageous conduct from you. I<br> thought the Irish said what they thought and the Divvil take the<br> hindermost. Tell me truthfully, don't you sometimes almost burst<br> from keeping your mouth shut?’<br><br> ‘Well--yes,’ Scarlett confessed reluctantly. ‘I do get awfully<br> bored when they talk about the Cause, morning, noon and night.<br> But goodness, Rhett Butler, if I admitted it nobody would speak to<br> me and none of the boys would dance with me!’<br><br> ‘Ah, yes, and one must be danced with, at all costs. Well, I<br> admire your self-control but I do not find myself equal to it.<br> Nor can I masquerade in a cloak of romance and patriotism, no<br> matter how convenient it might be. There are enough stupid<br> patriots who are risking every cent they have in the blockade and<br> who are going to come out of this war paupers. They don't need me<br> among their number, either to brighten the record of patriotism or<br> to increase the roll of paupers. Let them have the haloes. They<br> deserve them--for once I am being sincere--and, besides, haloes<br> will be about all they will have in a year or so.’<br><br> ‘I think you are very nasty to even hint such things when you know<br> very well that England and France are coming in on our side in no<br> time and--’<br><br> ‘Why, Scarlett! You must have been reading a newspaper! I'm<br> surprised at you. Don't do it again. It addles women's brains.<br> For your information, I was in England, not a month ago, and I'll<br> tell you this. England will never help the Confederacy. England<br> never bets on the underdog. That's why she's England. Besides,<br> the fat Dutch woman who is sitting on the throne is a God-fearing<br> soul and she doesn't approve of slavery. Let the English mill<br> workers starve because they can't get our cotton but never, never<br> strike a blow for slavery. And as for France, that weak imitation<br> of Napoleon is far too busy establishing the French in Mexico to<br> be bothered with us. In fact he welcomes this war, because it<br> keeps us too busy to run his troops out of Mexico. . . . No,<br> Scarlett, the idea of assistance from abroad is just a newspaper<br> invention to keep up the morale of the South. The Confederacy is<br> doomed. It's living on its hump now, like the camel, and even the<br> largest of humps aren't inexhaustible. I give myself about six<br> months more of blockading and then I'm through. After that, it<br> will be too risky. And I'll sell my boats to some foolish<br> Englishman who thinks he can slip them through. But one way or<br> the other, it's not bothering me. I've made money enough, and<br> it's in English banks and in gold. None of this worthless paper<br> for me.’<br><br> As always when he spoke, he sounded so plausible. Other people<br> might call his utterances treachery but, to Scarlett, they always<br> rang with common sense and truth. And she knew that this was<br> utterly wrong, knew she should be shocked and infuriated.<br> Actually she was neither, but she could pretend to be. It made<br> her feel more respectable and ladylike.<br><br> ‘I think what Dr. Meade wrote about was right, Captain Butler.<br> The only way to redeem yourself is to enlist after you sell your<br> boats. You're a West Pointer and--’<br><br> ‘You talk like a Baptist preacher making a recruiting speech.<br> Suppose I don't want to redeem myself? Why should I fight to<br> uphold the system that cast me out? I shall take pleasure in<br> seeing it smashed.’<br><br> ‘I never heard of any system,’ she said crossly.<br><br> ‘No? And yet you are a part of it, like I was, and I'll wager you<br> don't like it any more than I did. Well, why am I the black sheep<br> of the Butler family? For this reason and no other--I didn't<br> conform to Charleston and I couldn't. And Charleston is the<br> South, only intensified. I wonder if you realize yet what a bore<br> it is? So many things that one must do because they've always<br> been done. So many things, quite harmless, that one must not do<br> for the same reason. So many things that annoyed me by their<br> senselessness. Not marrying the young lady, of whom you have<br> probably heard, was merely the last straw. Why should I marry a<br> boring fool, simply because an accident prevented me from getting<br> her home before dark? And why permit her wild-eyed brother to<br> shoot and kill me, when I could shoot straighter? If I had been a<br> gentleman, of course, I would have let him kill me and that would<br> have wiped the blot from the Butler escutcheon. But--I like to<br> live. And so I've lived and I've had a good time. . . . When I<br> think of my brother, living among the sacred cows of Charleston,<br> and most reverent toward them, and remember his stodgy wife and<br> his Saint Cecilia Balls and his everlasting rice fields--then I<br> know the compensation for breaking with the system. Scarlett, our<br> Southern way of living is as antiquated as the feudal system of<br> the Middle Ages. The wonder is that it's lasted as long as it<br> has. It had to go and it's going now. And yet you expect me to<br> listen to orators like Dr. Meade who tell me our Cause is just and<br> holy? And get so excited by the roll of drums that I'll grab a<br> musket and rush off to Virginia to shed my blood for Marse Robert?<br> What kind of a fool do you think I am? Kissing the rod that<br> chastised me is not in my line. The South and I are even now.<br> The South threw me out to starve once. I haven't starved, and I<br> am making enough money out of the South's death throes to<br> compensate me for my lost birthright.’<br><br> ‘I think you are vile and mercenary,’ said Scarlett, but her<br> remark was automatic. Most of what he was saying went over her<br> head, as did any conversation that was not personal. But part of<br> it made sense. There were such a lot of foolish things about life<br> among nice people. Having to pretend that her heart was in the<br> grave when it wasn't. And how shocked everybody had been when she<br> danced at the bazaar. And the infuriating way people lifted their<br> eyebrows every time she did or said anything the least bit<br> different from what every other young woman did and said. But<br> still, she was jarred at hearing him attack the very traditions<br> that irked her most. She had lived too long among people who<br> dissembled politely not to feel disturbed at hearing her own<br> thoughts put into words.<br><br> ‘Mercenary? No, I'm only farsighted. Though perhaps that is<br> merely a synonym for mercenary. At least, people who were not as<br> farsighted as I will call it that. Any loyal Confederate who had<br> a thousand dollars in cash in 1861 could have done what I did, but<br> how few were mercenary enough to take advantage of their<br> opportunities! As for instance, right after Fort Sumter fell and<br> before the blockade was established, I bought up several thousand<br> bales of cotton at dirt-cheap prices and ran them to England.<br> They are still there in warehouses in Liverpool. I've never sold<br> them. I'm holding them until the English mills have to have<br> cotton and will give me any price I ask. I wouldn't be surprised<br> if I got a dollar a pound.’<br><br> ‘You'll get a dollar a pound when elephants roost in trees!’<br><br> ‘I'll believe I'll get it. Cotton is at seventy-two cents a pound<br> already. I'm going to be a rich man when this war is over,<br> Scarlett, because I was farsighted--pardon me, mercenary. I told<br> you once before that there were two times for making big money,<br> one in the upbuilding of a country and the other in its<br> destruction. Slow money on the upbuilding, fast money in the<br> crack-up. Remember my words. Perhaps they may be of use to you<br> some day.’<br><br> ‘I do appreciate good advice so much,’ said Scarlett, with all the<br> sarcasm she could muster. ‘But I don't need your advice. Do you<br> think Pa is a pauper? He's got all the money I'll ever need and<br> then I have Charles' property besides.’<br><br> ‘I imagine the French aristocrats thought practically the same<br> thing until the very moment when they climbed into the tumbrils.’<br><br> <br><br> Frequently Rhett pointed out to Scarlett the inconsistency of her<br> wearing black mourning clothes when she was participating in all<br> social activities. He liked bright colors and Scarlett's funeral<br> dresses and the crepe veil that hung from her bonnet to her heels<br> both amused him and offended him. But she clung to her dull black<br> dresses and her veil, knowing that if she changed them for colors<br> without waiting several more years, the town would buzz even more<br> than it was already buzzing. And besides, how would she ever<br> explain to her mother?<br><br> Rhett said frankly that the crepe veil made her look like a crow<br> and the black dresses added ten years to her age. This ungallant<br> statement sent her flying to the mirror to see if she really did<br> look twenty-eight instead of eighteen.<br><br> ‘I should think you'd have more pride than to try to look like<br> Mrs. Merriwether,’ he taunted. ‘And better taste than to wear<br> that veil to advertise a grief I'm sure you never felt. I'll lay<br> a wager with you. I'll have that bonnet and veil off your head<br> and a Paris creation on it within two months.’<br><br> ‘Indeed, no, and don't let's discuss it any further,’ said<br> Scarlett, annoyed by his reference to Charles. Rhett, who was<br> preparing to leave for Wilmington for another trip abroad,<br> departed with a grin on his face.<br><br> One bright summer morning some weeks later, he reappeared with a<br> brightly trimmed hatbox in his hand and, after finding that<br> Scarlett was alone in the house, he opened it. Wrapped in layers<br> of tissue was a bonnet, a creation that made her cry: ‘Oh, the<br> darling thing!’ as she reached for it. Starved for the sight,<br> much less the touch, of new clothes, it seemed the loveliest<br> bonnet she had ever seen. It was of dark-green taffeta, lined<br> with water silk of a pale-jade color. The ribbons that tied under<br> the chin were as wide as her hand and they, too, were pale green.<br> And, curled about the brim of this confection was the perkiest of<br> green ostrich plumes.<br><br> ‘Put it on,’ said Rhett, smiling.<br><br> She flew across the room to the mirror and plopped it on her head,<br> pushing back her hair to show her earrings and tying the ribbon<br> under her chin.<br><br> ‘How do I look?’ she cried, pirouetting for his benefit and<br> tossing her head so that the plume danced. But she knew she<br> looked pretty even before she saw confirmation in his eyes. She<br> looked attractively saucy and the green of the lining made her<br> eyes dark emerald and sparkling.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, whose bonnet is it? I'll buy it. I'll give you every<br> cent I've got for it.’<br><br> ‘It's your bonnet,’ he said. ‘Who else could wear that shade of<br> green? Don't you think I carried the color of your eyes well in<br> my mind?’<br><br> ‘Did you really have it trimmed just for me?’<br><br> ‘Yes, and there's 'Rue de la Paix' on the box, if that means<br> anything to you.’<br><br> It meant nothing to her, smiling at her reflection in the mirror.<br> Just at this moment, nothing mattered to her except that she<br> looked utterly charming in the first pretty hat she had put on her<br> head in two years. What she couldn't do with this hat! And then<br> her smile faded.<br><br> ‘Don't you like it?’<br><br> ‘Oh, it's a dream but-- Oh, I do hate to have to cover this<br> lovely green with crepe and dye the feather black.’<br><br> He was beside her quickly and his deft fingers untied the wide bow<br> under her chin. In a moment the hat was back in its box.<br><br> ‘What are you doing? You said it was mine.’<br><br> ‘But not to change to a mourning bonnet. I shall find some other<br> charming lady with green eyes who appreciates my taste.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you shan't! I'll die if I don't have it! Oh, please, Rhett,<br> don't be mean! Let me have it.’<br><br> ‘And turn it into a fright like your other hats? No.’<br><br> She clutched at the box. That sweet thing that made her look so<br> young and enchanting to be given to some other girl? Oh, never!<br> For a moment she thought of the horror of Pitty and Melanie. She<br> thought of Ellen and what she would say, and she shivered. But<br> vanity was stronger.<br><br> ‘I won't change it. I promise. Now, do let me have it.’<br><br> He gave her the box with a slightly sardonic smile and watched her<br> while she put it on again and preened herself.<br><br> ‘How much is it?’ she asked suddenly, her face falling. ‘I have<br> only fifty dollars but next month--’<br><br> ‘It would cost about two thousand dollars, Confederate money,’ he<br> said with a grin at her woebegone expression.<br><br> ‘Oh, dear-- Well, suppose I give you the fifty now and then when<br> I get--’<br><br> ‘I don't want any money for it,’ he said. ‘It's a gift.’<br><br> Scarlett's mouth dropped open. The line was so closely, so<br> carefully drawn where gifts from men were concerned.<br><br> ‘Candy and flowers, dear,’ Ellen had said time and again, ‘and<br> perhaps a book of poetry or an album or a small bottle of Florida<br> water are the only things a lady may accept from a gentleman.<br> Never, never any expensive gift, even from your fiance. And never<br> any gift of jewelry or wearing apparel, not even gloves or<br> handkerchiefs. Should you accept such gifts, men would know you<br> were no lady and would try to take liberties.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear,’ thought Scarlett, looking first at herself in the<br> mirror and then at Rhett's unreadable face. ‘I simply can't tell<br> him I won't accept it. It's too darling. I'd--I'd almost rather<br> he took a liberty, if it was a very small one.’ Then she was<br> horrified at herself for having such a thought and she turned<br> pink.<br><br> ‘I'll--I'll give you the fifty dollars--’<br><br> ‘If you do I will throw it in the gutter. Or, better still buy<br> masses for your soul. I'm sure your soul could do with a few<br> masses.’<br><br> She laughed unwillingly, and the laughing reflection under the<br> green brim decided her instantly.<br><br> ‘Whatever are you trying to do to me?’<br><br> ‘I'm tempting you with fine gifts until your girlish ideals are<br> quite worn away and you are at my mercy,’ he said. ‘'Accept only<br> candy and flowers from gentlemen, dearie,'‘ he mimicked, and she<br> burst into a giggle.<br><br> ‘You are a clever, black-hearted wretch, Rhett Butler, and you<br> know very well this bonnet's too pretty to be refused.’<br><br> His eyes mocked her, even while they complimented her beauty.<br><br> ‘Of course, you can tell Miss Pitty that you gave me a sample of<br> taffeta and green silk and drew a picture of the bonnet and I<br> extorted fifty dollars from you for it.’<br><br> ‘No. I shall say one hundred dollars and she'll tell everybody in<br> town and everybody will be green with envy and talk about my<br> extravagance. But Rhett, you mustn't bring me anything else so<br> expensive. It's awfully kind of you, but I really couldn't accept<br> anything else.’<br><br> ‘Indeed? Well, I shall bring you presents so long as it pleases<br> me and so long as I see things that will enhance your charms. I<br> shall bring you dark-green watered silk for a frock to match the<br> bonnet. And I warn you that I am not kind. I am tempting you<br> with bonnets and bangles and leading you into a pit. Always<br> remember I never do anything without reason and I never give<br> anything without expecting something in return. I always get<br> paid.’<br><br> His black eyes sought her face and traveled to her lips.<br><br> Scarlett cast down her eyes, excitement filling her. Now, he was<br> going to try to take liberties, just as Ellen predicted. He was<br> going to kiss her, or try to kiss her, and she couldn't quite make<br> up her flurried mind which it should be. If she refused, he might<br> jerk the bonnet right off her head and give it to some other girl.<br> On the other hand, if she permitted one chaste peck, he might<br> bring her other lovely presents in the hope of getting another<br> kiss. Men set such a store by kisses, though Heaven alone knew<br> why. And lots of times, after one kiss they fell completely in<br> love with a girl and made most entertaining spectacles of<br> themselves, provided the girl was clever and withheld her kisses<br> after the first one. It would be exciting to have Rhett Butler in<br> love with her and admitting it and begging for a kiss or a smile.<br> Yes, she would let him kiss her.<br><br> But he made no move to kiss her. She gave him a sidelong glance<br> from under her lashes and murmured encouragingly.<br><br> ‘So you always get paid, do you? And what do you expect to get<br> from me?’<br><br> ‘That remains to be seen.’<br><br> ‘Well, if you think I'll marry you to pay for the bonnet, I<br> won't,’ she said daringly and gave her head a saucy flirt that set<br> the plume to bobbing.<br><br> His white teeth gleamed under his little mustache.<br><br> ‘Madam, you flatter yourself, I do not want to marry you or anyone<br> else. I am not a marrying man.’<br><br> ‘Indeed!’ she cried, taken aback and now determined that he should<br> take some liberty. ‘I don't even intend to kiss you, either.’<br><br> ‘Then why is your mouth all pursed up in that ridiculous way?’<br><br> ‘Oh!’ she cried as she caught a glimpse of herself and saw that<br> her red lips were indeed in the proper pose for a kiss. ‘Oh!’ she<br> cried again, losing her temper and stamping her foot. ‘You are<br> the horridest man I have ever seen and I don't care if I never lay<br> eyes on you again!’<br><br> ‘If you really felt that way, you'd stamp on the bonnet. My, what<br> a passion you are in and it's quite becoming, as you probably<br> know. Come, Scarlett, stamp on the bonnet to show me what you<br> think of me and my presents.’<br><br> ‘Don't you dare touch this bonnet,’ she said, clutching it by the<br> bow and retreating. He came after her, laughing softly and took<br> her hands in his.<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett, you are so young you wring my heart,’ he said.<br> ‘And I shall kiss you, as you seem to expect it,’ and leaning down<br> carelessly, his mustache just grazed her cheek. ‘Now, do you feel<br> that you must slap me to preserve the proprieties?’<br><br> Her lips mutinous, she looked up into his eyes and saw so much<br> amusement in their dark depths that she burst into laughter. What<br> a tease he was and how exasperating! If he didn't want to marry<br> her and didn't even want to kiss her, what did he want? If he<br> wasn't in love with her, why did he call so often and bring her<br> presents?<br><br> ‘That's better,’ he said. ‘Scarlett, I'm a bad influence on you<br> and if you have any sense you will send me packing--if you can.<br> I'm very hard to get rid of. But I'm bad for you.’<br><br> ‘Are you?’<br><br> ‘Can't you see it? Ever since I met you at the bazaar, your<br> career has been most shocking and I'm to blame for most of it.<br> Who encouraged you to dance? Who forced you to admit that you<br> thought our glorious Cause was neither glorious nor sacred? Who<br> goaded you into admitting that you thought men were fools to die<br> for high-sounding principles? Who has aided you in giving the old<br> ladies plenty to gossip about? Who is getting you out of mourning<br> several years too soon? And who, to end all this, has lured you<br> into accepting a gift which no lady can accept and still remain a<br> lady?’<br><br> ‘You flatter yourself, Captain Butler. I haven't done anything so<br> scandalous and I'd have done everything you mentioned without your<br> aid anyway.’<br><br> ‘I doubt that,’ he said and his face went suddenly quiet and<br> somber. ‘You'd still be the broken-hearted widow of Charles<br> Hamilton and famed for your good deeds among the wounded.<br> Eventually, however--’<br><br> But she was not listening, for she was regarding herself pleasedly<br> in the mirror again, thinking she would wear the bonnet to the<br> hospital this very afternoon and take flowers to the convalescent<br> officers.<br><br> That there was truth in his last words did not occur to her. She<br> did not see that Rhett had pried open the prison of her widowhood<br> and set her free to queen it over unmarried girls when her days as<br> a belle should have been long past. Nor did she see that under<br> his influence she had come a long way from Ellen's teachings. The<br> change had been so gradual, the flouting of one small convention<br> seeming to have no connection with the flouting of another, and<br> none of them any connection with Rhett. She did not realize that,<br> with his encouragement, she had disregarded many of the sternest<br> injunctions of her mother concerning the proprieties, forgotten<br> the difficult lessons in being a lady.<br><br> She only saw that the bonnet was the most becoming one she ever<br> had, that it had not cost her a penny and that Rhett must be in<br> love with her, whether he admitted it or not. And she certainly<br> intended to find a way to make him admit it.<br><br> <br><br> The next day, Scarlett was standing in front of the mirror with a<br> comb in her hand and her mouth full of hairpins, attempting a new<br> coiffure which Maybelle, fresh from a visit to her husband in<br> Richmond, had said was the rage at the Capital. It was called<br> ‘Cats, Rats and Mice’ and presented many difficulties. The hair<br> was parted in the middle and arranged in three rolls of graduating<br> size on each side of the head, the largest, nearest the part,<br> being the ‘cat.’ The ‘cat’ and the ‘rat’ were easy to fix but the<br> ‘mice’ kept slipping out of her hairpins in an exasperating<br> manner. However, she was determined to accomplish it, for Rhett<br> was coming to supper and he always noticed and commented upon any<br> innovation of dress or hair.<br><br> As she struggled with her bushy, obstinate locks, perspiration<br> beading her forehead, she heard light running feet in the<br> downstairs hall and knew that Melanie was home from the hospital.<br> As she heard her fly up the stairs, two at a time, she paused,<br> hairpin in mid-air, realizing that something must be wrong, for<br> Melanie always moved as decorously as a dowager. She went to the<br> door and threw it open, and Melanie ran in, her face flushed and<br> frightened, looking like a guilty child.<br><br> There were tears on her cheeks, her bonnet was hanging on her neck<br> by the ribbons and her hoops swaying violently. She was clutching<br> something in her hand, and the reek of heavy cheap perfume came<br> into the room with her.<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett!’ she cried, shutting the door and sinking on the<br> bed. ‘Is Auntie home yet? She isn't? Oh, thank the Lord!<br> Scarlett, I'm so mortified I could die! I nearly swooned and,<br> Scarlett, Uncle Peter is threatening to tell Aunt Pitty!’<br><br> ‘Tell what?’<br><br> ‘That I was talking to that--to Miss--Mrs.--’ Melanie fanned her<br> hot face with her handkerchief. ‘That woman with red hair, named<br> Belle Watling!’<br><br> ‘Why, Melly!’ cried Scarlett, so shocked she could only stare.<br><br> Belle Watling was the red-haired woman she had seen on the street<br> the first day she came to Atlanta and by now, she was easily the<br> most notorious woman in town. Many prostitutes had flocked into<br> Atlanta, following the soldiers, but Belle stood out above the<br> rest, due to her flaming hair and the gaudy, overly fashionable<br> dresses she wore. She was seldom seen on Peachtree Street or in<br> any nice neighborhood, but when she did appear respectable women<br> made haste to cross the street to remove themselves from her<br> vicinity. And Melanie had been talking with her. No wonder Uncle<br> Peter was outraged.<br><br> ‘I shall die if Aunt Pitty finds out! You know she'll cry and<br> tell everybody in town and I'll be disgraced,’ sobbed Melanie.<br> ‘And it wasn't my fault. I--I couldn't run away from her. It<br> would have been so rude. Scarlett, I--I felt sorry for her. Do<br> you think I'm bad for feeling that way?’<br><br> But Scarlett was not concerned with the ethics of the matter.<br> Like most innocent and well-bred young women, she had a devouring<br> curiosity about prostitutes.<br><br> ‘What did she want? What does she talk like?’<br><br> ‘Oh, she used awful grammar but I could see she was trying so hard<br> to be elegant, poor thing. I came out of the hospital and Uncle<br> Peter and the carriage weren't waiting, so I thought I'd walk<br> home. And when I went by the Emersons' yard, there she was hiding<br> behind the hedge! Oh, thank Heaven, the Emersons are in Macon!<br> And she said, 'Please, Mrs. Wilkes, do speak a minute with me.' I<br> don't know how she knew my name. I knew I ought to run as hard as<br> I could but--well, Scarlett, she looked so sad and--well, sort of<br> pleading. And she had on a black dress and black bonnet and no<br> paint and really looked decent but for that red hair. And before<br> I could answer she said. 'I know I shouldn't speak to you but I<br> tried to talk to that old peahen, Mrs. Elsing, and she ran me away<br> from the hospital.'‘<br><br> ‘Did she really call her a peahen?’ said Scarlett pleasedly and<br> laughed.<br><br> ‘Oh, don't laugh. It isn't funny. It seems that Miss--this<br> woman, wanted to do something for the hospital--can you imagine<br> it? She offered to nurse every morning and, of course, Mrs.<br> Elsing must have nearly died at the idea and ordered her out of<br> the hospital. And then she said, 'I want to do something, too.<br> Ain't I a Confedrut, good as you?' And, Scarlett, I was right<br> touched at her wanting to help. You know, she can't be all bad if<br> she wants to help the Cause. Do you think I'm bad to feel that<br> way?’<br><br> ‘For Heaven's sake, Melly, who cares if you're bad? What else did<br> she say?’<br><br> ‘She said she'd been watching the ladies go by to the hospital and<br> thought I had--a--a kind face and so she stopped me. She had some<br> money and she wanted me to take it and use it for the hospital and<br> not tell a soul where it came from. She said Mrs. Elsing wouldn't<br> let it be used if she knew what kind of money it was. What kind<br> of money! That's when I thought I'd swoon! And I was so upset<br> and anxious to get away, I just said: 'Oh, yes, indeed, how sweet<br> of you' or something idiotic, and she smiled and said: 'That's<br> right Christian of you' and shoved this dirty handkerchief into my<br> hand. Ugh, can you smell the perfume?’<br><br> Melanie held out a man's handkerchief, soiled and highly perfumed,<br> in which some coins were knotted.<br><br> ‘She was saying thank you and something about bringing me some<br> money every week and just then Uncle Peter drove up and saw me!’<br> Melly collapsed into tears and laid her head on the pillow. ‘And<br> when he saw who was with me, he--Scarlett, he HOLLERED at me!<br> Nobody has ever hollered at me before in my whole life. And he<br> said, 'You git in dis hyah cah'ige dis minute!' Of course, I did,<br> and all the way home he blessed me out and wouldn't let me explain<br> and said he was going to tell Aunt Pitty. Scarlett, do go down<br> and beg him not to tell her. Perhaps he will listen to you. It<br> will kill Auntie if she knows I ever even looked that woman in the<br> face. Will you?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I will. But let's see how much money is in here. It feels<br> heavy.’<br><br> She untied the knot and a handful of gold coins rolled out on the<br> bed.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, there's fifty dollars here! And in gold!’ cried<br> Melanie, awed, as she counted the bright pieces. ‘Tell me, do you<br> think it's all right to use this kind--well, money made--er--this<br> way for the boys? Don't you think that maybe God will understand<br> that she wanted to help and won't care if it is tainted? When I<br> think of how many things the hospital needs--’<br><br> But Scarlett was not listening. She was looking at the dirty<br> handkerchief, and humiliation and fury were filling her. There<br> was a monogram in the corner in which were the initials ‘R. K. B.’<br> In her top drawer was a handkerchief just like this, one that<br> Rhett Butler had lent her only yesterday to wrap about the stems<br> of wild flowers they had picked. She had planned to return it to<br> him when he came to supper tonight.<br><br> So Rhett consorted with that vile Watling creature and gave her<br> money. That was where the contribution to the hospital came from.<br> Blockade gold. And to think that Rhett would have the gall to<br> look a decent woman in the face after being with that creature!<br> And to think that she could have believed he was in love with her!<br> This proved he couldn't be.<br><br> Bad women and all they involved were mysterious and revolting<br> matters to her. She knew that men patronized these women for<br> purposes which no lady should mention--or, if she did mention<br> them, in whispers and by indirection and euphemism. She had<br> always thought that only common vulgar men visited such women.<br> Before this moment, it had never occurred to her that nice men--<br> that is, men she met at nice homes and with whom she danced--could<br> possibly do such things. It opened up an entirely new field of<br> thought and one that was horrifying. Perhaps all men did this!<br> It was bad enough that they forced their wives to go through such<br> indecent performances but to actually seek out low women and pay<br> them for such accommodation! Oh, men were so vile, and Rhett<br> Butler was the worst of them all!<br><br> She would take this handkerchief and fling it in his face and show<br> him the door and never, never speak to him again. But no, of<br> course she couldn't do that. She could never, never let him know<br> she even realized that bad women existed, much less that he<br> visited them. A lady could never do that.<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she thought in fury. ‘If I just wasn't a lady, what<br> wouldn't I tell that varmint!’<br><br> And, crumbling the handkerchief in her hand, she went down the<br> stairs to the kitchen in search of Uncle Peter. As she passed the<br> stove, she shoved the handkerchief into the flames and with<br> impotent anger watched it burn.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIV<br><br> <br> Hope was rolling high in every Southern heart as the summer of 1863<br> came in. Despite privation and hardships, despite food speculators<br> and kindred scourges, despite death and sickness and suffering<br> which had now left their mark on nearly every family, the South was<br> again saying ‘One more victory and the war is over,’ saying it with<br> even more happy assurance than in the summer before. The Yankees<br> were proving a hard nut to crack but they were cracking at last.<br><br> Christmas of 1862 had been a happy one for Atlanta, for the whole<br> South. The Confederacy had scored a smashing victory, at<br> Fredericksburg and the Yankee dead and wounded were counted in the<br> thousands. There was universal rejoicing in that holiday season,<br> rejoicing and thankfulness that the tide was turning. The army in<br> butternut were now seasoned fighters, their generals had proven<br> their mettle, and everyone knew that when the campaign reopened in<br> the spring, the Yankees would be crushed for good and all.<br><br> Spring came and the fighting recommenced. May came and the<br> Confederacy won another great victory at Chancellorsville. The<br> South roared with elation.<br><br> Closer at home, a Union cavalry dash into Georgia had been turned<br> into a Confederate triumph. Folks were still laughing and slapping<br> each other on the back and saying: ‘Yes, sir! When old Nathan<br> Bedford Forrest gets after them, they better git!’ Late in April,<br> Colonel Streight and eighteen hundred Yankee cavalry had made a<br> surprise raid into Georgia, aiming at Rome, only a little more than<br> sixty miles north of Atlanta. They had ambitious plans to cut the<br> vitally important railroad between Atlanta and Tennessee and then<br> swing southward into Atlanta to destroy the factories and the war<br> supplies concentrated there in that key city of the Confederacy.<br><br> It was a bold stroke and it would have cost the South dearly,<br> except for Forrest. With only one-third as many men--but what men<br> and what riders!--he had started after them, engaged them before<br> they even reached Rome, harassed them day and night and finally<br> captured the entire force!<br><br> The news reached Atlanta almost simultaneously with the news of the<br> victory at Chancellorsville, and the town fairly rocked with<br> exultation and with laughter. Chancellorsville might be a more<br> important victory but the capture of Streight's raiders made the<br> Yankees positively ridiculous.<br><br> ‘No, sir, they'd better not fool with old Forrest,’ Atlanta said<br> gleefully as the story was told over and over.<br><br> The tide of the Confederacy's fortune was running strong and full<br> now, sweeping the people jubilantly along on its flood. True, the<br> Yankees under Grant had been besieging Vicksburg since the middle<br> of May. True, the South had suffered a sickening loss when<br> Stonewall Jackson had been fatally wounded at Chancellorsville.<br> True, Georgia had lost one of her bravest and most brilliant sons<br> when General T. R. R. Cobb had been killed at Fredericksburg. But<br> the Yankees just couldn't stand any more defeats like Fredericksburg<br> and Chancellorsville. They'd have to give in, and then this cruel<br> war would be over.<br><br> The first days of July came and with them the rumor, later<br> confirmed by dispatches, that Lee was marching into Pennsylvania.<br> Lee in the enemy's territory! Lee forcing battle! This was the<br> last fight of the war!<br><br> Atlanta was wild with excitement, pleasure and a hot thirst for<br> vengeance. Now the Yankees would know what it meant to have the<br> war carried into their own country. Now they'd know what it meant<br> to have fertile fields stripped, horses and cattle stolen, houses<br> burned, old men and boys dragged off to prison and women and<br> children turned out to starve.<br><br> Everyone knew what the Yankees had done in Missouri, Kentucky,<br> Tennessee and Virginia. Even small children could recite with hate<br> and fear the horrors the Yankees had inflicted upon the conquered<br> territory. Already Atlanta was full of refugees from east<br> Tennessee, and the town had heard firsthand stories from them of<br> what suffering they had gone through. In that section, the<br> Confederate sympathizers were in the minority and the hand of war<br> fell heavily upon them, as it did on all the border states,<br> neighbor informing against neighbor and brother killing brother.<br> These refugees cried out to see Pennsylvania one solid sheet of<br> flame, and even the gentlest of old ladies wore expressions of grim<br> pleasure.<br><br> But when the news trickled back that Lee had issued orders that no<br> private property in Pennsylvania should be touched, that looting<br> would be punished by death and that the army would pay for every<br> article it requisitioned--then it needed all the reverence the<br> General had earned to save his popularity. Not turn the men loose<br> in the rich storehouses of that prosperous state? What was General<br> Lee thinking of? And our boys so hungry and needing shoes and<br> clothes and horses!<br><br> A hasty note from Darcy Meade to the doctor, the only first-hand<br> information Atlanta received during those first days of July, was<br> passed from hand to hand, with mounting indignation.<br><br> ‘Pa, could you manage to get me a pair of boots? I've been<br> barefooted for two weeks now and I don't see any prospects of<br> getting another pair. If I didn't have such big feet I could get<br> them off dead Yankees like the other boys, but I've never yet found<br> a Yankee whose feet were near as big as mine. If you can get me<br> some, don't mail them. Somebody would steal them on the way and I<br> wouldn't blame them. Put Phil on the train and send him up with<br> them. I'll write you soon, where we'll be. Right now I don't<br> know, except that we're marching north. We're in Maryland now and<br> everybody says we're going on into Pennsylvania. . . .<br><br> ‘Pa, I thought that we'd give the Yanks a taste of their own<br> medicine but the General says No, and personally I don't care to<br> get shot just for the pleasure of burning some Yank's house. Pa,<br> today we marched through the grandest cornfields you ever saw. We<br> don't have corn like this down home. Well, I must admit we did a<br> bit of private looting in that corn, for we were all pretty hungry<br> and what the General don't know won't hurt him. But that green<br> corn didn't do us a bit of good. All the boys have got dysentery<br> anyway, and that corn made it worse. It's easier to walk with a<br> leg wound than with dysentery. Pa, do try to manage some boots for<br> me. I'm a captain now and a captain ought to have boots, even if<br> he hasn't got a new uniform or epaulets.’<br><br> But the army was in Pennsylvania--that was all that mattered. One<br> more victory and the war would be over, and then Darcy Meade could<br> have all the boots he wanted, and the boys would come marching home<br> and everybody would be happy again. Mrs. Meade's eyes grew wet as<br> she pictured her soldier son home at last, home to stay.<br><br> On the third of July, a sudden silence fell on the wires from the<br> north, a silence that lasted till midday of the fourth when<br> fragmentary and garbled reports began to trickle into headquarters<br> in Atlanta. There had been hard fighting in Pennsylvania, near a<br> little town named Gettysburg, a great battle with all Lee's army<br> massed. The news was uncertain, slow in coming, for the battle had<br> been fought in the enemy's territory and the reports came first<br> through Maryland, were relayed to Richmond and then to Atlanta.<br><br> Suspense grew and the beginnings of dread slowly crawled over the<br> town. Nothing was so bad as not knowing what was happening.<br> Families with sons at the front prayed fervently that their boys<br> were not in Pennsylvania, but those who knew their relatives were<br> in the same regiment with Darcy Meade clamped their teeth and said<br> it was an honor for them to be in the big fight that would lick the<br> Yankees for good and all.<br><br> In Aunt Pitty's house, the three women looked into one another's<br> eyes with fear they could not conceal. Ashley was in Darcy's<br> regiment.<br><br> On the fifth came evil tidings, not from the North but from the<br> West. Vicksburg had fallen, fallen after a long and bitter siege,<br> and practically all the Mississippi River, from St. Louis to New<br> Orleans was in the hands of the Yankees. The Confederacy had been<br> cut in two. At any other time, the news of this disaster would<br> have brought fear and lamentation to Atlanta. But now they could<br> give little thought to Vicksburg. They were thinking of Lee in<br> Pennsylvania, forcing battle. Vicksburg's loss would be no<br> catastrophe if Lee won in the East. There lay Philadelphia, New<br> York, Washington. Their capture would paralyze the North and more<br> than cancel off the defeat on the Mississippi.<br><br> The hours dragged by and the black shadow of calamity brooded over<br> the town, obscuring the hot sun until people looked up startled<br> into the sky as if incredulous that it was clear and blue instead<br> of murky and heavy with scudding clouds. Everywhere, women<br> gathered in knots, huddled in groups on front porches, on<br> sidewalks, even in the middle of the streets, telling each other<br> that no news is good news, trying to comfort each other, trying to<br> present a brave appearance. But hideous rumors that Lee was<br> killed, the battle lost, and enormous casualty lists coming in,<br> fled up and down the quiet streets like darting bats. Though they<br> tried not to believe, whole neighborhoods, swayed by panic, rushed<br> to town, to the newspapers, to headquarters, pleading for news, any<br> news, even bad news.<br><br> Crowds formed at the depot, hoping for news from incoming trains,<br> at the telegraph office, in front of the harried headquarters,<br> before the locked doors of the newspapers. They were oddly still<br> crowds, crowds that quietly grew larger and larger. There was no<br> talking. Occasionally an old man's treble voice begged for news,<br> and instead of inciting the crowd to babbling it only intensified<br> the hush as they heard the oft-repeated: ‘Nothing on the wires yet<br> from the North except that there's been fighting.’ The fringe of<br> women on foot and in carriages grew greater and greater, and the<br> heat of the close-packed bodies and dust rising from restless feet<br> were suffocating. The women did not speak, but their pale set<br> faces pleaded with a mute eloquence that was louder than wailing.<br><br> There was hardly a house in town that had not sent away a son, a<br> brother, a father, a lover, a husband, to this battle. They all<br> waited to hear the news that death had come to their homes. They<br> expected death. They did not expect defeat. That thought they<br> dismissed. Their men might be dying, even now, on the sun-parched<br> grass of the Pennsylvania hills. Even now the Southern ranks might<br> be falling like grain before a hailstorm, but the Cause for which<br> they fought could never fall. They might be dying in thousands<br> but, like the fruit of the dragon's teeth, thousands of fresh men<br> in gray and butternut with the Rebel yell on their lips would<br> spring up from the earth to take their places. Where these men<br> would come from, no one knew. They only knew, as surely as they<br> knew there was a just and jealous God in Heaven, that Lee was<br> miraculous and the Army of Virginia invincible.<br><br> <br><br> Scarlett, Melanie and Miss Pittypat sat in front of the Daily<br> Examiner office in the carriage with the top back, sheltered<br> beneath their parasols. Scarlett's hands shook so that her parasol<br> wobbled above her head, Pitty was so excited her nose quivered in<br> her round face like a rabbit's, but Melanie sat as though carved of<br> stone, her dark eyes growing larger and larger as time went by.<br> She made only one remark in two hours, as she took a vial of<br> smelling salts from her reticule and handed it to her aunt, the<br> only time she had ever spoken to her, in her whole life, with<br> anything but tenderest affection.<br><br> ‘Take this, Auntie, and use it if you feel faint. I warn you if<br> you do faint you'll just have to faint and let Uncle Peter take you<br> home, for I'm not going to leave this place till I hear about--till<br> I hear. And I'm not going to let Scarlett leave me, either.’<br><br> Scarlett had no intention of leaving, no intention of placing<br> herself where she could not have the first news of Ashley. No,<br> even if Miss Pitty died, she wouldn't leave this spot. Somewhere,<br> Ashley was fighting, perhaps dying, and the newspaper office was<br> the only place where she could learn the truth.<br><br> She looked about the crowd, picking out friends and neighbors, Mrs.<br> Meade with her bonnet askew and her arm through that of fifteen-<br> year-old Phil; the Misses McLure trying to make their trembling<br> upper lips cover their buck teeth; Mrs. Elsing, erect as a Spartan<br> mother, betraying her inner turmoil only by the straggling gray<br> locks that hung from her chignon; and Fanny Elsing white as a<br> ghost. (Surely Fanny wouldn't be so worried about her brother<br> Hugh. Had she a real beau at the front that no one suspected?)<br> Mrs. Merriwether sat in her carriage patting Maybelle's hand.<br> Maybelle looked so very pregnant it was a disgrace for her to be<br> out in public, even if she did have her shawl carefully draped over<br> her. Why should she be so worried? Nobody had heard that the<br> Louisiana troops were in Pennsylvania. Probably her hairy little<br> Zouave was safe in Richmond this very minute.<br><br> There was a movement on the outskirts of the crowd and those on<br> foot gave way as Rhett Butler carefully edged his horse toward Aunt<br> Pitty's carriage. Scarlett thought: He's got courage, coming here<br> at this time when it wouldn't take anything to make this mob tear<br> him to pieces because he isn't in uniform. As he came nearer, she<br> thought she might be the first to rend him. How dared he sit there<br> on that fine horse, in shining boots and handsome white linen suit,<br> so sleek and well fed, smoking an expensive cigar, when Ashley and<br> all the other boys were fighting the Yankees, barefooted,<br> sweltering in the heat, hungry, their bellies rotten with disease?<br><br> Bitter looks were thrown at him as he came slowly through the<br> press. Old men growled in their beards, and Mrs. Merriwether who<br> feared nothing rose slightly in her carriage and said clearly:<br> ‘Speculator!’ in a tone that made the word the foulest and most<br> venomous of epithets. He paid no heed to anyone but raised his hat<br> to Melly and Aunt Pitty and, riding to Scarlett's side, leaned down<br> and whispered: ‘Don't you think this would be the time for Dr.<br> Meade to give us his familiar speech about victory perching like a<br> screaming eagle on our banners?’<br><br> Her nerves taut with suspense, she turned on him as swiftly as an<br> angry cat, hot words bubbling to her lips, but he stopped them with<br> a gesture.<br><br> ‘I came to tell you ladies,’ he said loudly, ‘that I have been to<br> headquarters and the first casualty lists are coming in.’<br><br> At these words a hum rose among those near enough to hear his<br> remark, and the crowd surged, ready to turn and run down Whitehall<br> Street toward headquarters.<br><br> ‘Don't go,’ he called, rising in his saddle and holding up his<br> hand. ‘The lists have been sent to both newspapers and are now<br> being printed. Stay where you are!’<br><br> ‘Oh, Captain Butler,’ cried Melly, turning to him with tears in her<br> eyes. ‘How kind of you to come and tell us! When will they be<br> posted?’<br><br> ‘They should be out any minute, Madam. The reports have been in<br> the offices for half an hour now. The major in charge didn't want<br> to let that out until the printing was done, for fear the crowd<br> would wreck the offices trying to get news. Ah! Look!’<br><br> The side window of the newspaper office opened and a hand was<br> extended, bearing a sheaf of long narrow galley proofs, smeared<br> with fresh ink and thick with names closely printed. The crowd<br> fought for them, tearing the slips in half, those obtaining them<br> trying to back out through the crowd to read, those behind pushing<br> forward, crying: ‘Let me through!’<br><br> ‘Hold the reins,’ said Rhett shortly, swinging to the ground and<br> tossing the bridle to Uncle Peter. They saw his heavy shoulders<br> towering above the crowd as he went through, brutally pushing and<br> shoving. In a while he was back, with half a dozen in his hands.<br> He tossed one to Melanie and distributed the others among the<br> ladies in the nearest carriages, the Misses McLure, Mrs. Meade,<br> Mrs. Merriwether, Mrs. Elsing.<br><br> ‘Quick, Melly,’ cried Scarlett, her heart in her throat,<br> exasperation sweeping her as she saw that Melly's hands were<br> shaking so that it was impossible for her to read.<br><br> ‘Take it,’ whispered Melly, and Scarlett snatched it from her. The<br> Ws. Where were the Ws? Oh, there they were at the bottom and all<br> smeared up. ‘White,’ she read and her voice shook, ‘Wilkens . . .<br> Winn . . . Zebulon . . . Oh, Melly, he's not on it! He's not on<br> it! Oh, for God's sake, Auntie, Melly, pick up the salts! Hold<br> her up, Melly.’<br><br> Melly, weeping openly with happiness, steadied Miss Pitty's rolling<br> head and held the smelling salts under her nose. Scarlett braced<br> the fat old lady on the other side, her heart singing with joy.<br> Ashley was alive. He wasn't even wounded. How good God was to<br> pass him by! How--<br><br> She heard a low moan and, turning, saw Fanny Elsing lay her head on<br> her mother's bosom, saw the casualty list flutter to the floor of<br> the carriage, saw Mrs. Elsing's thin lips quiver as she gathered<br> her daughter in her arms and said quietly to the coachman: ‘Home.<br> Quickly.’ Scarlett took a quick glance at the lists. Hugh Elsing<br> was not listed. Fanny must have had a beau and now he was dead.<br> The crowd made way in sympathetic silence for the Elsings'<br> carriage, and after them followed the little wicker pony cart of<br> the McLure girls. Miss Faith was driving, her face like a rock,<br> and for once, her teeth were covered by her lips. Miss Hope, death<br> in her face, sat erect beside her, holding her sister's skirt in a<br> tight grasp. They looked like very old women. Their young brother<br> Dallas was their darling and the only relative the maiden ladies<br> had in the world. Dallas was gone.<br><br> ‘Melly! Melly!’ cried Maybelle, joy in her voice, ‘Rene is safe!<br> And Ashley, too! Oh, thank God!’ The shawl had slipped from her<br> shoulders and her condition was most obvious but, for once, neither<br> she nor Mrs. Merriwether cared. ‘Oh, Mrs. Meade! Rene--’ Her<br> voice changed, swiftly, ‘Melly, look!--Mrs. Meade, please! Darcy<br> isn't--?’<br><br> Mrs. Meade was looking down into her lap and she did not raise her<br> head when her name was called, but the face of little Phil beside<br> her was an open book that all might read.<br><br> ‘There, there, Mother,’ he said, helplessly. Mrs. Meade looked up,<br> meeting Melanie's eyes.<br><br> ‘He won't need those boots now,’ she said.<br><br> ‘Oh, darling!’ cried Melly, beginning to sob, as she shoved Aunt<br> Pitty onto Scarlett's shoulder and scrambled out of the carriage<br> and toward that of the doctor's wife.<br><br> ‘Mother, you've still got me,’ said Phil, in a forlorn effort at<br> comforting the white-faced woman beside him. ‘And if you'll just<br> let me, I'll go kill all the Yank--’<br><br> Mrs. Meade clutched his arm as if she would never let it go, said<br> ‘No!’ in a strangled voice and seemed to choke.<br><br> ‘Phil Meade, you hush your mouth!’ hissed Melanie, climbing in<br> beside Mrs. Meade and taking her in her arms. ‘Do you think it'll<br> help your mother to have you off getting shot too? I never heard<br> anything so silly. Drive us home, quick!’<br><br> She turned to Scarlett as Phil picked up the reins.<br><br> ‘As soon as you take Auntie home, come over to Mrs. Meade's.<br> Captain Butler, can you get word to the doctor? He's at the<br> hospital.’<br><br> The carriage moved off through the dispersing crowd. Some of the<br> women were weeping with joy, but most looked too stunned to realize<br> the heavy blows that had fallen upon them. Scarlett bent her head<br> over the blurred lists, reading rapidly, to find names of friends.<br> Now that Ashley was safe she could think of other people. Oh, how<br> long the list was! How heavy the toll from Atlanta, from all of<br> Georgia.<br><br> Good Heavens! ‘Calvert--Raiford, Lieutenant.’ Raif! Suddenly she<br> remembered the day, so long ago, when they had run away together<br> but decided to come home at nightfall because they were hungry and<br> afraid of the dark.<br><br> ‘Fontaine--Joseph K., private.’ Little bad-tempered Joe! And<br> Sally hardly over having her baby!<br><br> ‘Munroe--LaFayette, Captain.’ And Lafe had been engaged to<br> Cathleen Calvert. Poor Cathleen! Hers had been a double loss, a<br> brother and a sweetheart. But Sally's loss was greater--a brother<br> and a husband.<br><br> Oh, this was too terrible. She was almost afraid to read further.<br> Aunt Pitty was heaving and sighing on her shoulder and, with small<br> ceremony, Scarlett pushed her over into a corner of the carriage<br> and continued her reading.<br><br> Surely, surely--there couldn't be three ‘Tarleton’ names on that<br> list. Perhaps--perhaps the hurried printer had repeated the name<br> by error. But no. There they were. ‘Tarleton--Brenton,<br> Lieutenant.’ ‘Tarleton--Stuart, Corporal.’ ‘Tarleton--Thomas,<br> private.’ And Boyd, dead the first year of the war, was buried God<br> knew where in Virginia. All the Tarleton boys gone. Tom and the<br> lazy long-legged twins with their love of gossip and their absurd<br> practical jokes and Boyd who had the grace of a dancing master and<br> the tongue of a wasp.<br><br> She could not read any more. She could not know if any other of<br> those boys with whom she had grown up, danced, flirted, kissed were<br> on that list. She wished that she could cry, do something to ease<br> the iron fingers that were digging into her throat.<br><br> ‘I'm sorry, Scarlett,’ said Rhett. She looked up at him. She had<br> forgotten he was still there. ‘Many of your friends?’<br><br> She nodded and struggled to speak: ‘About every family in the<br> County--and all--all three of the Tarleton boys.’<br><br> His face was quiet, almost somber, and there was no mocking in his<br> eyes.<br><br> ‘And the end is not yet,’ he said. ‘These are just the first lists<br> and they're incomplete. There'll be a longer list tomorrow.’ He<br> lowered his voice so that those in the near-by carriages could not<br> hear. ‘Scarlett, General Lee must have lost the battle. I heard<br> at headquarters that he had retreated back into Maryland.’<br><br> She raised frightened eyes to his, but her fear did not spring from<br> Lee's defeat. Longer casualty lists tomorrow! Tomorrow. She had<br> not thought of tomorrow, so happy was she at first that Ashley's<br> name was not on that list. Tomorrow. Why, right this minute he<br> might be dead and she would not know it until tomorrow, or perhaps<br> a week from tomorrow.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, why do there have to be wars? It would have been so<br> much better for the Yankees to pay for the darkies--or even for us<br> to give them the darkies free of charge than to have this happen.’<br><br> ‘It isn't the darkies, Scarlett. They're just the excuse.<br> There'll always be wars because men love wars. Women don't, but<br> men do--yea, passing the love of women.’<br><br> His mouth twisted in his old smile and the seriousness was gone<br> from his face. He lifted his wide Panama hat.<br><br> ‘Good-by. I'm going to find Dr. Meade. I imagine the irony of me<br> being the one to tell him of his son's death will be lost on him,<br> just now. But later, he'll probably hate to think that a<br> speculator brought the news of a hero's death.’<br><br> <br><br> Scarlett put Miss Pitty to bed with a toddy, left Prissy and Cookie<br> in attendance and went down the street to the Meade house. Mrs.<br> Meade was upstairs with Phil, waiting her husband's return, and<br> Melanie sat in the parlor, talking in a low voice to a group of<br> sympathetic neighbors. She was busy with needle and scissors,<br> altering a mourning dress that Mrs. Elsing had lent to Mrs. Meade.<br> Already the house was full of the acrid smell of clothes boiling in<br> homemade black dye for, in the kitchen, the sobbing cook was<br> stirring all of Mrs. Meade's dresses in the huge wash pot.<br><br> ‘How is she?’ questioned Scarlett softly.<br><br> ‘Not a tear,’ said Melanie. ‘It's terrible when women can't cry.<br> I don't know how men stand things without crying. I guess it's<br> because they're stronger and braver than women. She says she's<br> going to Pennsylvania by herself to bring him home. The doctor<br> can't leave the hospital.’<br><br> ‘It will be dreadful for her! Why can't Phil go?’<br><br> ‘She's afraid he'll join the army if he gets out of her sight. You<br> know he's so big for his age and they're taking them at sixteen<br> now.’<br><br> One by one the neighbors slipped away, reluctant to be present when<br> the doctor came home, and Scarlett and Melanie were left alone,<br> sewing in the parlor. Melanie looked sad but tranquil, though<br> tears dropped down on the cloth she held in her hands. Evidently<br> she had not thought that the battle might still be going on and<br> Ashley perhaps dead at this very moment. With panic in her heart,<br> Scarlett did not know whether to tell Melanie of Rhett's words and<br> have the dubious comfort of her misery or keep it to herself.<br> Finally she decided to remain quiet. It would never do for Melanie<br> to think her too worried about Ashley. She thanked God that<br> everyone, Melly and Pitty included, had been too engrossed in her<br> own worries that morning to notice her conduct.<br><br> After an interval of silent sewing, they heard sounds outside and,<br> peering through the curtains, they saw Dr. Meade alighting from his<br> horse. His shoulders were sagging and his head bowed until his<br> gray beard spread out fanlike on his chest. He came slowly into<br> the house and, laying down his hat and bag, kissed both the girls<br> silently. Then he went tiredly up the stairs. In a moment Phil<br> came down, all long legs and arms and awkwardness. The two girls<br> looked an invitation to join them, but he went onto the front porch<br> and, seating himself on the top step, dropped his head on his<br> cupped palm.<br><br> Melly sighed.<br><br> ‘He's mad because they won't let him go fight the Yankees. Fifteen<br> years old! Oh, Scarlett, it would be Heaven to have a son like<br> that!’<br><br> ‘And have him get killed,’ said Scarlett shortly, thinking of<br> Darcy.<br><br> ‘It would be better to have a son even if he did get killed than to<br> never have one,’ said Melanie and gulped. ‘You can't understand,<br> Scarlett, because you've got little Wade, but I-- Oh, Scarlett, I<br> want a baby so bad! I know you think I'm horrid to say it right<br> out, but it's true and only what every woman wants and you know<br> it.’<br><br> Scarlett restrained herself from sniffing.<br><br> ‘If God should will that Ashley should be--taken, I suppose I could<br> bear it, though I'd rather die if he died. But God would give me<br> strength to bear it. But I could not bear having him dead and not<br> having--not having a child of his to comfort me. Oh, Scarlett, how<br> lucky you are! Though you lost Charlie, you have his son. And if<br> Ashley goes, I'll have nothing. Scarlett, forgive me, but<br> sometimes I've been so jealous of you--’<br><br> ‘Jealous--of me?’ cried Scarlett, stricken with guilt.<br><br> ‘Because you have a son and I haven't. I've even pretended<br> sometimes that Wade was mine because it's so awful not to have a<br> child.’<br><br> ‘Fiddle-dee-dee!’ said Scarlett in relief. She cast a quick glance<br> at the slight figure with blushing face bent over the sewing.<br> Melanie might want children but she certainly did not have the<br> figure for bearing them. She was hardly taller than a twelve-year-<br> old child, her hips were as narrow as a child's and her breasts<br> were very flat. The very thought of Melanie having a child was<br> repellent to Scarlett. It brought up too many thoughts she<br> couldn't bear thinking. If Melanie should have a child of<br> Ashley's, it would be as though something were taken from Scarlett<br> that was her own.<br><br> ‘Do forgive me for saying that about Wade. You know I love him so.<br> You aren't mad at me, are you?’<br><br> ‘Don't be silly,’ said Scarlett shortly. ‘And go out on the porch<br> and do something for Phil. He's crying.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XV<br><br> <br> The army, driven back into Virginia, went into winter quarters on<br> the Rapidan--a tired, depleted army since the defeat at Gettysburg--<br> and as the Christmas season approached, Ashley came home on<br> furlough. Scarlett, seeing him for the first time in more than two<br> years, was frightened by the violence of her feelings. When she<br> had stood in the parlor at Twelve Oaks and seen him married to<br> Melanie, she had thought she could never love him with a more<br> heartbreaking intensity than she did at that moment. But now she<br> knew her feelings of that long-past night were those of a spoiled<br> child thwarted of a toy. Now, her emotions were sharpened by her<br> long dreams of him, heightened by the repression she had been<br> forced to put on her tongue.<br><br> This Ashley Wilkes in his faded, patched uniform, his blond hair<br> bleached tow by summer suns, was a different man from the easy-<br> going, drowsy-eyed boy she had loved to desperation before the war.<br> And he was a thousand times more thrilling. He was bronzed and<br> lean now, where he had once been fair and slender, and the long<br> golden mustache drooping about his mouth, cavalry style, was the<br> last touch needed to make him the perfect picture of a soldier.<br><br> He stood with military straightness in his old uniform, his pistol<br> in its worn holster, his battered scabbard smartly slapping his<br> high boots, his tarnished spurs dully gleaming--Major Ashley<br> Wilkes, C.S.A. The habit of command sat upon him now, a quiet air<br> of self-reliance and authority, and grim lines were beginning to<br> emerge about his mouth. There was something new and strange about<br> the square set of his shoulders and the cool bright gleam of his<br> eyes. Where he had once been lounging and indolent, he was now as<br> alert as a prowling cat, with the tense alertness of one whose<br> nerves are perpetually drawn as tight as the strings of a violin.<br> In his eyes, there was a fagged, haunted look, and the sunburned<br> skin was tight across the fine bones of his face--her same handsome<br> Ashley, yet so very different.<br><br> Scarlett had made her plans to spend Christmas at Tara, but after<br> Ashley's telegram came no power on earth, not even a direct command<br> from the disappointed Ellen, could drag her away from Atlanta. Had<br> Ashley intended going to Twelve Oaks, she would have hastened to<br> Tara to be near him; but he had written his family to join him in<br> Atlanta, and Mr. Wilkes and Honey and India were already in town.<br> Go home to Tara and miss seeing him, after two long years? Miss<br> the heart-quickening sound of his voice, miss reading in his eyes<br> that he had not forgotten her? Never! Not for all the mothers in<br> the world.<br><br> Ashley came home four days before Christmas, with a group of the<br> County boys also on furlough, a sadly diminished group since<br> Gettysburg. Cade Calvert was among them, a thin, gaunt Cade, who<br> coughed continually, two of the Munroe boys, bubbling with the<br> excitement of their first leave since 1861, and Alex and Tony<br> Fontaine, splendidly drunk, boisterous and quarrelsome. The group<br> had two hours to wait between trains and, as it was taxing the<br> diplomacy of the sober members of the party to keep the Fontaines<br> from fighting each other and perfect strangers in the depot, Ashley<br> brought them all home to Aunt Pittypat's.<br><br> ‘You'd think they'd had enough fighting in Virginia,’ said Cade<br> bitterly, as he watched the two bristle like game-cocks over who<br> should be the first to kiss the fluttering and flattered Aunt<br> Pitty. ‘But no. They've been drunk and picking fights ever since<br> we got to Richmond. The provost guard took them up there and if it<br> hadn't been for Ashley's slick tongue, they'd have spent Christmas<br> in jail.’<br><br> But Scarlett hardly heard a word he said, so enraptured was she at<br> being in the same room with Ashley again. How could she have<br> thought during these two years that other men were nice or handsome<br> or exciting? How could she have even endured hearing them make<br> love to her when Ashley was in the world? He was home again,<br> separated from her only by the width of the parlor rug, and it took<br> all her strength not to dissolve in happy tears every time she<br> looked at him sitting there on the sofa with Melly on one side and<br> India on the other and Honey hanging over his shoulder. If only<br> she had the right to sit there beside him, her arm through his! If<br> only she could pat his sleeve every few minutes to make sure he was<br> really there, hold his hand and use his handkerchief to wipe away<br> her tears of joy. For Melanie was doing all these things,<br> unashamedly. Too happy to be shy and reserved, she hung on her<br> husband's arm and adored him openly with her eyes, with her smiles,<br> her tears. And Scarlett was too happy to resent this, too glad to<br> be jealous. Ashley was home at last!<br><br> Now and then she put her hand up to her cheek where he had kissed<br> her and felt again the thrill of his lips and smiled at him. He<br> had not kissed her first, of course. Melly had hurled herself into<br> his arms crying incoherently, holding him as though she would never<br> let him go. And then, India and Honey had hugged him, fairly<br> tearing him from Melanie's arms. Then he had kissed his father,<br> with a dignified affectionate embrace that showed the strong quiet<br> feeling that lay between them. And then Aunt Pitty, who was<br> jumping up and down on her inadequate little feet with excitement.<br> Finally he turned to her, surrounded by all the boys who were<br> claiming their kisses, and said: ‘Oh, Scarlett! You pretty,<br> pretty thing!’ and kissed her on the cheek.<br><br> With that kiss, everything she had intended to say in welcome took<br> wings. Not until hours later did she recall that he had not kissed<br> her on the lips. Then she wondered feverishly if he would have<br> done it had she met him alone, bending his tall body over hers,<br> pulling her up on tiptoe, holding her for a long, long time. And<br> because it made her happy to think so, she believed that he would.<br> But there would be time for all things, a whole week! Surely she<br> could maneuver to get him alone and say: ‘Do you remember those<br> rides we used to take down our secret bridle paths?’ ‘Do you<br> remember how the moon looked that night when we sat on the steps at<br> Tara and you quoted that poem?’ (Good Heavens! What was the name<br> of that poem, anyway?) ‘Do you remember that afternoon when I<br> sprained my ankle and you carried me home in your arms in the<br> twilight?’<br><br> Oh, there were so many things she would preface with ‘Do you<br> remember?’ So many dear memories that would bring back to him<br> those lovely days when they roamed the County like care-free<br> children, so many things that would call to mind the days before<br> Melanie Hamilton entered on the scene. And while they talked she<br> could perhaps read in his eyes some quickening of emotion, some<br> hint that behind the barrier of husbandly affection for Melanie he<br> still cared, cared as passionately as on that day of the barbecue<br> when he burst forth with the truth. It did not occur to her to<br> plan just what they would do if Ashley should declare his love for<br> her in unmistakable words. It would be enough to know that he did<br> care. . . . Yes, she could wait, could let Melanie have her happy<br> hour of squeezing his arm and crying. Her time would come. After<br> all, what did a girl like Melanie know of love?<br><br> ‘Darling, you look like a ragamuffin,’ said Melanie when the first<br> excitement of homecoming was over. ‘Who did mend your uniform and<br> why did they use blue patches?’<br><br> ‘I thought I looked perfectly dashing,’ said Ashley, considering<br> his appearance. ‘Just compare me with those rag-tags over there<br> and you'll appreciate me more. Mose mended the uniform and I<br> thought he did very well, considering that he'd never had a needle<br> in his hand before the war. About the blue cloth, when it comes to<br> a choice between having holes in your britches or patching them<br> with pieces of a captured Yankee uniform--well, there just isn't<br> any choice. And as for looking like a ragamuffin, you should thank<br> your stars your husband didn't come home barefooted. Last week my<br> old boots wore completely out, and I would have come home with<br> sacks tied on my feet if we hadn't had the good luck to shoot two<br> Yankee scouts. The boots of one of them fitted me perfectly.’<br><br> He stretched out his long legs in their scarred high boots for them<br> to admire.<br><br> ‘And the boots of the other scout didn't fit me,’ said Cade.<br> ‘They're two sizes too small and they're killing me this minute.<br> But I'm going home in style just the same.’<br><br> ‘And the selfish swine won't give them to either of us,’ said Tony.<br> ‘And they'd fit our small, aristocratic Fontaine feet perfectly.<br> Hell's afire, I'm ashamed to face Mother in these brogans. Before<br> the war she wouldn't have let one of our darkies wear them.’<br><br> ‘Don't worry,’ said Alex, eyeing Cade's boots. ‘We'll take them<br> off of him on the train going home. I don't mind facing Mother but<br> I'm da--I mean I don't intend for Dimity Munroe to see my toes<br> sticking out.’<br><br> ‘Why, they're my boots. I claimed them first,’ said Tony,<br> beginning to scowl at his brother; and Melanie, fluttering with<br> fear at the possibility of one of the famous Fontaine quarrels,<br> interposed and made peace.<br><br> ‘I had a full beard to show you girls,’ said Ashley, ruefully<br> rubbing his face where half-healed razor nicks still showed. ‘It<br> was a beautiful beard and if I do say it myself, neither Jeb Stuart<br> nor Nathan Bedford Forrest had a handsomer one. But when we got to<br> Richmond, those two scoundrels,’ indicating the Fontaines, ‘decided<br> that as they were shaving their beards, mine should come off too.<br> They got me down and shaved me, and it's a wonder my head didn't<br> come off along with the beard. It was only by the intervention of<br> Evan and Cade that my mustache was saved.’<br><br> ‘Snakes, Mrs. Wilkes! You ought to thank me. You'd never have<br> recognized him and wouldn't have let him in the door,’ said Alex.<br> ‘We did it to show our appreciation of his talking the provost<br> guard out of putting us in jail. If you say the word, we'll take<br> the mustache off for you, right now.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no, thank you!’ said Melanie hastily, clutching Ashley in a<br> frightened way, for the two swarthy little men looked capable of<br> any violence. ‘I think it's perfectly lovely.’<br><br> ‘That's love,’ said the Fontaines, nodding gravely at each other.<br><br> When Ashley went into the cold to see the boys off to the depot in<br> Aunt Pitty's carriage, Melanie caught Scarlett's arm.<br><br> ‘Isn't his uniform dreadful? Won't my coat be a surprise? Oh, if<br> only I had enough cloth for britches too!’<br><br> That coat for Ashley was a sore subject with Scarlett, for she<br> wished so ardently that she and not Melanie were bestowing it as a<br> Christmas gift. Gray wool for uniforms was now almost literally<br> more priceless than rubies, and Ashley was wearing the familiar<br> homespun. Even butternut was now none too plentiful, and many of<br> the soldiers were dressed in captured Yankee uniforms which had<br> been turned a dark-brown color with walnut-shell dye. But Melanie,<br> by rare luck, had come into possession of enough gray broadcloth to<br> make a coat--a rather short coat but a coat just the same. She had<br> nursed a Charleston boy in the hospital and when he died had<br> clipped a lock of his hair and sent it to his mother, along with<br> the scant contents of his pockets and a comforting account of his<br> last hours which made no mention of the torment in which he died.<br> A correspondence had sprung up between them and, learning that<br> Melanie had a husband at the front, the mother had sent her the<br> length of gray cloth and brass buttons which she had bought for her<br> dead son. It was a beautiful piece of material, thick and warm and<br> with a dull sheen to it, undoubtedly blockade goods and undoubtedly<br> very expensive. It was now in the hands of the tailor and Melanie<br> was hurrying him to have it ready by Christmas morning. Scarlett<br> would have given anything to be able to provide the rest of the<br> uniform, but the necessary materials were simply not to be had in<br> Atlanta.<br><br> She had a Christmas present for Ashley, but it paled in<br> insignificance beside the glory of Melanie's gray coat. It was a<br> small ‘housewife,’ made of flannel, containing the whole precious<br> pack of needles Rhett had brought her from Nassau, three of her<br> linen handkerchiefs, obtained from the same source, two spools of<br> thread and a small pair of scissors. But she wanted to give him<br> something more personal, something a wife could give a husband, a<br> shirt, a pair of gauntlets, a hat. Oh, yes, a hat by all means.<br> That little flat-topped forage cap Ashley was wearing looked<br> ridiculous. Scarlett had always hated them. What if Stonewall<br> Jackson had worn one in preference to a slouch felt? That didn't<br> make them any more dignified looking. But the only hats obtainable<br> in Atlanta were crudely made wool hats, and they were tackier than<br> the monkey-hat forage caps.<br><br> When she thought of hats, she thought of Rhett Butler. He had so<br> many hats, wide Panamas for summer, tall beavers for formal<br> occasions, hunting hats, slouch hats of tan and black and blue.<br> What need had he for so many when her darling Ashley rode in the<br> rain with moisture dripping down his collar from the back of his<br> cap?<br><br> ‘I'll make Rhett give me that new black felt of his,’ she decided.<br> ‘And I'll put a gray ribbon around the brim and sew Ashley's wreath<br> on it and it will look lovely.’<br><br> She paused and thought it might be difficult to get the hat without<br> some explanation. She simply could not tell Rhett she wanted it<br> for Ashley. He would raise his brows in that nasty way he always<br> had when she even mentioned Ashley's name and, like as not, would<br> refuse to give her the hat. Well, she'd make up some pitiful story<br> about a soldier in the hospital who needed it and Rhett need never<br> know the truth.<br><br> All that afternoon, she maneuvered to be alone with Ashley, even<br> for a few minutes, but Melanie was beside him constantly, and India<br> and Honey, their pale lashless eyes glowing, followed him about the<br> house. Even John Wilkes, visibly proud of his son, had no<br> opportunity for quiet conversation with him.<br><br> It was the same at supper where they all plied him with questions<br> about the war. The war! Who cared about the war? Scarlett didn't<br> think Ashley cared very much for that subject either. He talked at<br> length, laughed frequently and dominated the conversation more<br> completely than she had ever seen him do before, but he seemed to<br> say very little. He told them jokes and funny stories about<br> friends, talked gaily about makeshifts, making light of hunger and<br> long marches in the rain, and described in detail how General Lee<br> had looked when he rode by on the retreat from Gettysburg and<br> questioned: ‘Gentlemen, are you Georgia troops? Well, we can't<br> get along without you Georgians!’<br><br> It seemed to Scarlett that he was talking fervishly to keep them<br> from asking questions he did not want to answer. When she saw his<br> eyes falter and drop before the long, troubled gaze of his father,<br> a faint worry and bewilderment rose in her as to what was hidden in<br> Ashley's heart. But it soon passed, for there was no room in her<br> mind for anything except a radiant happiness and a driving desire<br> to be alone with him.<br><br> That radiance lasted until everyone in the circle about the open<br> fire began to yawn, and Mr. Wilkes and the girls took their<br> departure for the hotel. Then as Ashley and Melanie and Pittypat<br> and Scarlett mounted the stairs, lighted by Uncle Peter, a chill<br> fell on her spirit. Until that moment when they stood in the<br> upstairs hall, Ashley had been hers, only hers, even if she had not<br> had a private word with him that whole afternoon. But now, as she<br> said good night, she saw that Melanie's cheeks were suddenly<br> crimson and she was trembling. Her eyes were on the carpet and,<br> though she seemed overcome with some frightening emotion, she<br> seemed shyly happy. Melanie did not even look up when Ashley<br> opened the bedroom door, but sped inside. Ashley said good night<br> abruptly, and he did not meet Scarlett's eyes either.<br><br> The door closed behind them, leaving Scarlett open mouthed and<br> suddenly desolate. Ashley was no longer hers. He was Melanie's.<br> And as long as Melanie lived, she could go into rooms with Ashley<br> and close the door--and close out the rest of the world.<br><br> Now Ashley was going away, back to Virginia, back to the long<br> marches in the sleet, to hungry bivouacs in the snow, to pain and<br> hardship and to the risk of all the bright beauty of his golden<br> head and proud slender body being blotted out in an instant, like<br> an ant beneath a careless heel. The past week with its shimmering,<br> dreamlike beauty, its crowded hours of happiness, was gone.<br><br> The week had passed swiftly, like a dream, a dream fragrant with<br> the smell of pine boughs and Christmas trees, bright with little<br> candles and home-made tinsel, a dream where minutes flew as rapidly<br> as heartbeats. Such a breathless week when something within her<br> drove Scarlett with mingled pain and pleasure to pack and cram<br> every minute with incidents to remember after he was gone,<br> happenings which she could examine at leisure in the long months<br> ahead, extracting every morsel of comfort from them--dance, sing,<br> laugh, fetch and carry for Ashley, anticipate his wants, smile when<br> he smiles, be silent when he talks, follow him with your eyes so<br> that each line of his erect body, each lift of his eyebrows, each<br> quirk of his mouth, will be indelibly printed on your mind--for a<br> week goes by so fast and the war goes on forever.<br><br> She sat on the divan in the parlor, holding her going-away gift for<br> him in her lap, waiting while he said good-by to Melanie, praying<br> that when he did come down the stairs he would be alone and she<br> might be granted by Heaven a few moments alone with him. Her ears<br> strained for sounds from upstairs, but the house was oddly still,<br> so still that even the sound of her breathing seemed loud. Aunt<br> Pittypat was crying into her pillows in her room, for Ashley had<br> told her good-by half an hour before. No sounds of murmuring<br> voices or of tears came from behind the closed door of Melanie's<br> bedroom. It seemed to Scarlett that he had been in that room for<br> hours, and she resented bitterly each moment that he stayed, saying<br> good-by to his wife, for the moments were slipping by so fast and<br> his time was so short.<br><br> She thought of all the things she had intended to say to him during<br> this week. But there had been no opportunity to say them, and she<br> knew now that perhaps she would never have the chance to say them.<br><br> Such foolish little things, some of them: ‘Ashley, you will be<br> careful, won't you?’ ‘Please don't get your feet wet. You take<br> cold so easily.’ ‘Don't forget to put a newspaper across your<br> chest under your shirt. It keeps out the wind so well.’ But there<br> were other things, more important things she had wanted to say,<br> much more important things she had wanted to hear him say, things<br> she had wanted to read in his eyes, even if he did not speak them.<br><br> So many things to say and now there was no time! Even the few<br> minutes that remained might be snatched away from her if Melanie<br> followed him to the door, to the carriage block. Why hadn't she<br> made the opportunity during this last week? But always, Melanie<br> was at his side, her eyes caressing him adoringly, always friends<br> and neighbors and relatives were in the house and, from morning<br> till night, Ashley was never alone. Then, at night, the door of<br> the bedroom closed and he was alone with Melanie. Never once<br> during these last days had he betrayed to Scarlett by one look, one<br> word, anything but the affection a brother might show a sister or a<br> friend, a lifelong friend. She could not let him go away, perhaps<br> forever, without knowing whether he still loved her. Then, even if<br> he died, she could nurse the warm comfort of his secret love to the<br> end of her days.<br><br> After what seemed an eternity of waiting, she heard the sound of<br> his boots in the bedroom above and the door opening and closing.<br> She heard him coming down the steps. Alone! Thank God for that!<br> Melanie must be too overcome by the grief of parting to leave her<br> room. Now she would have him for herself for a few precious<br> minutes.<br><br> He came down the steps slowly, his spurs clinking, and she could<br> hear the slap-slap of his saber against his high boots. When he<br> came into the parlor, his eyes were somber. He was trying to smile<br> but his face was as white and drawn as a man bleeding from an<br> internal wound. She rose as he entered, thinking with proprietary<br> pride that he was the handsomest soldier she had ever seen. His<br> long holster and belt glistened and his silver spurs and scabbard<br> gleamed, from the industrious polishing Uncle Peter had given them.<br> His new coat did not fit very well, for the tailor had been hurried<br> and some of the seams were awry. The bright new sheen of the gray<br> coat was sadly at variance with the worn and patched butternut<br> trousers and the scarred boots, but if he had been clothed in<br> silver armor he could not have looked more the shining knight to<br> her.<br><br> ‘Ashley,’ she begged abruptly, ‘may I go to the train with you?’<br><br> ‘Please don't. Father and the girls will be there. And anyway,<br> I'd rather remember you saying good-by to me here than shivering at<br> the depot. There's so much to memories.’<br><br> Instantly she abandoned her plan. If India and Honey who disliked<br> her so much were to be present at the leave taking, she would have<br> no chance for a private word.<br><br> ‘Then I won't go,’ she said. ‘See, Ashley! I've another present<br> for you.’<br><br> A little shy, now that the time had come to give it to him, she<br> unrolled the package. It was a long yellow sash, made of thick<br> China silk and edged with heavy fringe. Rhett Butler had brought<br> her a yellow shawl from Havana several months before, a shawl<br> gaudily embroidered with birds and flowers in magenta and blue.<br> During this last week, she had patiently picked out all the<br> embroidery and cut up the square of silk and stitched it into a<br> sash length.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, it's beautiful! Did you make it yourself? Then I'll<br> value it all the more. Put it on me, my dear. The boys will be<br> green with envy when they see me in the glory of my new coat and<br> sash.’<br><br> She wrapped the bright lengths about his slender waist, above his<br> belt, and tied the ends in a lover's knot. Melanie might have<br> given him his new coat but this sash was her gift, her own secret<br> guerdon for him to wear into battle, something that would make him<br> remember her every time he looked at it. She stood back and viewed<br> him with pride, thinking that even Jeb Stuart with his flaunting<br> sash and plume could not look so dashing as her cavalier.<br><br> ‘It's beautiful,’ he repeated, fingering the fringe. ‘But I know<br> you've cut up a dress or a shawl to make it. You shouldn't have<br> done it, Scarlett. Pretty things are too hard to get these days.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, I'd--’<br><br> She had started to say: ‘I'd cut up my heart for you to wear if<br> you wanted it,’ but she finished, ‘I'd do anything for you!’<br><br> ‘Would you?’ he questioned and some of the somberness lifted from<br> his face. ‘Then, there's something you can do for me, Scarlett,<br> something that will make my mind easier when I'm away.’<br><br> ‘What is it?’ she asked joyfully, ready to promise prodigies.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, will you look after Melanie for me?’<br><br> ‘Look after Melly?’<br><br> Her heart sank with bitter disappointment. So this was something<br> beautiful, something spectacular! And then anger flared. This<br> moment was her moment with Ashley, hers alone. And yet, though<br> Melanie was absent, her pale shadow lay between them. How could he<br> bring up her name in their moment of farewell? How could he ask<br> such a thing of her?<br><br> He did not notice the disappointment on her face. As of old, his<br> eyes were looking through her and beyond her, at something else,<br> not seeing her at all.<br><br> ‘Yes, keep an eye on her, take care of her. She's so frail and she<br> doesn't realize it. She'll wear herself out nursing and sewing.<br> And she's so gentle and timid. Except for Aunt Pittypat and Uncle<br> Henry and you, she hasn't a close relative in the world, except the<br> Burrs in Macon and they're third cousins. And Aunt Pitty--<br> Scarlett, you know she's like a child. And Uncle Henry is an old<br> man. Melanie loves you so much, not just because you were<br> Charlie's wife, but because--well, because you're you and she loves<br> you like a sister. Scarlett, I have nightmares when I think what<br> might happen to her if I were killed and she had no one to turn to.<br> Will you promise?’<br><br> She did not even hear his last request, so terrified was she by<br> those ill-omened words, ‘if I were killed.’<br><br> Every day she had read the casualty lists, read them with her heart<br> in her throat, knowing that the world would end if anything should<br> happen to him. But always, always, she had an inner feeling that<br> even if the Confederate Army were entirely wiped out, Ashley would<br> be spared. And now he had spoken the frightful words! Goose bumps<br> came out all over her and fear swamped her, a superstitious fear<br> she could not combat with reason. She was Irish enough to believe<br> in second sight, especially where death premonitions were<br> concerned, and in his wide gray eyes she saw some deep sadness<br> which she could only interpret as that of a man who has felt the<br> cold finger on his shoulder, has heard the wail of the Banshee.<br><br> ‘You mustn't say it! You mustn't even think it. It's bad luck to<br> speak of death! Oh, say a prayer, quickly!’<br><br> ‘You say it for me and light some candles, too,’ he said, smiling<br> at the frightened urgency in her voice.<br><br> But she could not answer, so stricken was she by the pictures her<br> mind was drawing, Ashley lying dead in the snows of Virginia, so<br> far away from her. He went on speaking and there was a quality in<br> his voice, a sadness, a resignation, that increased her fear until<br> every vestige of anger and disappointment was blotted out.<br><br> ‘I'm asking you for this reason, Scarlett. I cannot tell what will<br> happen to me or what will happen to any of us. But when the end<br> comes, I shall be far away from here, even if I am alive, too far<br> away to look out for Melanie.’<br><br> ‘The--the end?’<br><br> ‘The end of the war--and the end of the world.’<br><br> ‘But Ashley, surely you can't think the Yankees will beat us? All<br> this week you've talked about how strong General Lee--’<br><br> ‘All this week I've talked lies, like all men talk when they're on<br> furlough. Why should I frighten Melanie and Aunt Pitty before<br> there's any need for them to be frightened? Yes, Scarlett, I think<br> the Yankees have us. Gettysburg was the beginning of the end. The<br> people back home don't know it yet. They can't realize how things<br> stand with us, but--Scarlett, some of my men are barefooted now and<br> the snow is deep in Virginia. And when I see their poor frozen<br> feet, wrapped in rags and old sacks, and I see the blood prints<br> they leave in the snow, and know that I've got a whole pair of<br> boots--well, I feel like I should give mine away and be barefooted<br> too.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, promise me you won't give them away!’<br><br> ‘When I see things like that and then look at the Yankees--then I<br> see the end of everything. Why Scarlett, the Yankees are buying<br> soldiers from Europe by the thousands! Most of the prisoners we've<br> taken recently can't even speak English. They're Germans and Poles<br> and wild Irishmen who talk Gaelic. But when we lose a man, he<br> can't be replaced. When our shoes wear out, there are no more<br> shoes. We're bottled up, Scarlett. And we can't fight the whole<br> world.’<br><br> She thought wildly: Let the whole Confederacy crumble in the dust.<br> Let the world end, but you must not die! I couldn't live if you<br> were dead!<br><br> ‘I hope you will not repeat what I have said, Scarlett. I do not<br> want to alarm the others. And, my dear, I would not have alarmed<br> you by saying these things, were it not that I had to explain why I<br> ask you to look after Melanie. She's so frail and weak and you're<br> so strong, Scarlett. It will be a comfort to me to know that you<br> are together if anything happens to me. You will promise, won't<br> you?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes!’ she cried, for at that moment, seeing death at his<br> elbow, she would have promised anything. ‘Ashley, Ashley! I can't<br> let you go away! I simply can't be brave about it!’<br><br> ‘You must be brave,’ he said, and his voice changed subtly. It was<br> resonant, deeper, and his words fell swiftly as though hurried with<br> some inner urgency. ‘You must be brave. For how else can I stand<br> it?’<br><br> Her eyes sought his face quickly and with joy, wondering if he<br> meant that leaving her was breaking his heart, even as it was<br> breaking hers. His face was as drawn as when he came down from<br> bidding Melanie good-by, but she could read nothing in his eyes.<br> He leaned down, took her face in his hands, and kissed her lightly<br> on the forehead.<br><br> ‘Scarlett! Scarlett! You are so fine and strong and good. So<br> beautiful, not just your sweet face, my dear, but all of you, your<br> body and your mind and your soul.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley,’ she whispered happily, thrilling at his words and his<br> touch on her face. ‘Nobody else but you ever--’<br><br> ‘I like to think that perhaps I know you better than most people<br> and that I can see beautiful things buried deep in you that others<br> are too careless and too hurried to notice.’<br><br> He stopped speaking and his hands dropped from her face, but his<br> eyes still clung to her eyes. She waited a moment, breathless for<br> him to continue, a-tiptoe to hear him say the magic three words.<br> But they did not come. She searched his face frantically, her lips<br> quivering, for she saw he had finished speaking.<br><br> This second blighting of her hopes was more than heart could bear<br> and she cried ‘Oh!’ in a childish whisper and sat down, tears<br> stinging her eyes. Then she heard an ominous sound in the<br> driveway, outside the window, a sound that brought home to her even<br> more sharply the imminence of Ashley's departure. A pagan hearing<br> the lapping of the waters around Charon's boat could not have felt<br> more desolate. Uncle Peter, muffled in a quilt, was bringing out<br> the carriage to take Ashley to the train.<br><br> Ashley said ‘Good-by,’ very softly, caught up from the table the<br> wide felt hat she had inveigled from Rhett and walked into the dark<br> front hall. His hand on the doorknob, he turned and looked at her,<br> a long, desperate look, as if he wanted to carry away with him<br> every detail of her face and figure. Through a blinding mist of<br> tears she saw his face and with a strangling pain in her throat she<br> knew that he was going away, away from her care, away from the safe<br> haven of this house, and out of her life, perhaps forever, without<br> having spoken the words she so yearned to hear. Time was going by<br> like a mill race, and now it was too late. She ran stumbling<br> across the parlor and into the hall and clutched the ends of his<br> sash.<br><br> ‘Kiss me,’ she whispered. ‘Kiss me good-by.’<br><br> His arms went around her gently, and he bent his head to her face.<br> At the first touch of his lips on hers, her arms were about his<br> neck in a strangling grip. For a fleeting immeasurable instant, he<br> pressed her body close to his. Then she felt a sudden tensing of<br> all his muscles. Swiftly, he dropped the hat to the floor and,<br> reaching up, detached her arms from his neck.<br><br> ‘No, Scarlett, no,’ he said in a low voice, holding her crossed<br> wrists in a grip that hurt.<br><br> ‘I love you,’ she said choking. ‘I've always loved you. I've<br> never loved anybody else. I just married Charlie to--to try to<br> hurt you. Oh, Ashley, I love you so much I'd walk every step of<br> the way to Virginia just to be near you! And I'd cook for you and<br> polish your boots and groom your horse--Ashley, say you love me!<br> I'll live on it for the rest of my life!’<br><br> He bent suddenly to retrieve his hat and she had one glimpse of his<br> face. It was the unhappiest face she was ever to see, a face from<br> which all aloofness had fled. Written on it were his love for and<br> joy that she loved him, but battling them both were shame and<br> despair.<br><br> ‘Good-by,’ he said hoarsely.<br><br> The door clicked open and a gust of cold wind swept the house,<br> fluttering the curtains. Scarlett shivered as she watched him run<br> down the walk to the carriage, his saber glinting in the feeble<br> winter sunlight, the fringe of his sash dancing jauntily.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XVI<br><br> <br> January and February of 1864 passed, full of cold rains and wild<br> winds, clouded by pervasive gloom and depression. In addition to<br> the defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the center of the Southern<br> line had caved. After hard fighting, nearly all of Tennessee was<br> now held by the Union troops. But even with this loss on the top<br> of the others, the South's spirit was not broken. True, grim<br> determination had taken the place of high-hearted hopes, but people<br> could still find a silver lining in the cloud. For one thing, the<br> Yankees had been stoutly repulsed in September when they had tried<br> to follow up their victories in Tennessee by an advance into<br> Georgia.<br><br> Here in the northwesternmost corner of the state, at Chickamauga,<br> serious fighting had occurred on Georgia soil for the first time<br> since the war began. The Yankees had taken Chattanooga and then<br> had marched through the mountain passes into Georgia, but they had<br> been driven back with heavy losses.<br><br> Atlanta and its railroads had played a big part in making<br> Chickamauga a great victory for the South. Over the railroads that<br> led down from Virginia to Atlanta and then northward to Tennessee,<br> General Longstreet's corps had been rushed to the scene of the<br> battle. Along the entire route of several hundred miles, the<br> tracks had been cleared and all the available rolling stock in the<br> Southeast had been assembled for the movement.<br><br> Atlanta had watched while train after train rolled through the<br> town, hour after hour, passenger coaches, box cars, flat cars,<br> filled with shouting men. They had come without food or sleep,<br> without their horses, ambulances or supply trains and, without<br> waiting for the rest, they had leaped from the trains and into the<br> battle. And the Yankees had been driven out of Georgia, back into<br> Tennessee.<br><br> It was the greatest feat of the war, and Atlanta took pride and<br> personal satisfaction in the thought that its railroads had made<br> the victory possible.<br><br> But the South had needed the cheering news from Chickamauga to<br> strengthen its morale through the winter. No one denied now that<br> the Yankees were good fighters and, at last, they had good<br> generals. Grant was a butcher who did not care how many men he<br> slaughtered for a victory, but victory he would have. Sheridan was<br> a name to bring dread to Southern hearts. And, then, there was a<br> man named Sherman who was being mentioned more and more often. He<br> had risen to prominence in the campaigns in Tennessee and the West,<br> and his reputation as a determined and ruthless fighter was<br> growing.<br><br> None of them, of course, compared with General Lee. Faith in the<br> General and the army was still strong. Confidence in ultimate<br> victory never wavered. But the war was dragging out so long.<br> There were so many dead, so many wounded and maimed for life, so<br> many widowed, so many orphaned. And there was still a long<br> struggle ahead, which meant more dead, more wounded, more widows<br> and orphans.<br><br> To make matters worse, a vague distrust of those in high places had<br> begun to creep over the civilian population. Many newspapers were<br> outspoken in their denunciation of President Davis himself and the<br> manner in which he prosecuted the war. There were dissensions<br> within the Confederate cabinet, disagreements between President<br> Davis and his generals. The currency was falling rapidly. Shoes<br> and clothing for the army were scarce, ordnance supplies and drugs<br> were scarcer. The railroads needed new cars to take the place of<br> old ones and new iron rails to replace those torn up by the<br> Yankees. The generals in the field were crying out for fresh<br> troops, and there were fewer and fewer fresh troops to be had.<br> Worst of all, some of the state governors, Governor Brown of<br> Georgia among them, were refusing to send state militia troops and<br> arms out of their borders. There were thousands of able-bodied men<br> in the state troops for whom the army was frantic, but the<br> government pleaded for them in vain.<br><br> With the new fall of currency, prices soared again. Beef, pork and<br> butter cost thirty-five dollars a pound, flour fourteen hundred<br> dollars a barrel, soda one hundred dollars a pound, tea five<br> hundred dollars a pound. Warm clothing, when it was obtainable at<br> all, had risen to such prohibitive prices that Atlanta ladies were<br> lining their old dresses with rags and reinforcing them with<br> newspapers to keep out the wind. Shoes cost from two hundred to<br> eight hundred dollars a pair, depending on whether they were made<br> of ‘cardboard’ or real leather. Ladies now wore gaiters made of<br> their old wool shawls and cut-up carpets. The soles were made of<br> wood.<br><br> The truth was that the North was holding the South in a virtual<br> state of siege, though many did not realize it. The Yankee<br> gunboats had tightened the mesh at the ports and very few ships<br> were now able to slip past the blockade.<br><br> The South had always lived by selling cotton and buying the things<br> it did not produce, but now it could neither sell nor buy. Gerald<br> O'Hara had three years' crops of cotton stored under the shed near<br> the gin house at Tara, but little good it did him. In Liverpool it<br> would bring one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, but there was<br> no hope of getting it to Liverpool. Gerald had changed from a<br> wealthy man to a man who was wondering how he would feed his family<br> and his negroes through the winter.<br><br> Throughout the South, most of the cotton planters were in the same<br> fix. With the blockade closing tighter and tighter, there was no<br> way to get the South's money crop to its market in England, no way<br> to bring in the necessaries which cotton money had brought in years<br> gone by. And the agricultural South, waging war with the<br> industrial North, was needing so many things now, things it had<br> never thought of buying in times of peace.<br><br> It was a situation made to order for speculators and profiteers,<br> and men were not lacking to take advantage of it. As food and<br> clothing grew scarcer and prices rose higher and higher, the public<br> outcry against the speculators grew louder and more venomous. In<br> those early days of 1864, no newspaper could be opened that did not<br> carry scathing editorials denouncing the speculators as vultures<br> and bloodsucking leeches and calling upon the government to put<br> them down with a hard hand. The government did its best, but the<br> efforts came to nothing, for the government was harried by many<br> things.<br><br> Against no one was feeling more bitter than against Rhett Butler.<br> He had sold his boats when blockading grew too hazardous, and he<br> was now openly engaged in food speculation. The stories about him<br> that came back to Atlanta from Richmond and Wilmington made those<br> who had received him in other days writhe with shame.<br><br> In spite of all these trials and tribulations, Atlanta's ten<br> thousand population had grown to double that number during the war.<br> Even the blockade had added to Atlanta's prestige. From time<br> immemorial, the coast cities had dominated the South, commercially<br> and otherwise. But now with the ports closed and many of the port<br> cities captured or besieged, the South's salvation depended upon<br> itself. The interior section was what counted, if the South was<br> going to win the war, and Atlanta was now the center of things.<br> The people of the town were suffering hardship, privation, sickness<br> and death as severely as the rest of the Confederacy; but Atlanta,<br> the city, had gained rather than lost as a result of the war.<br> Atlanta, the heart of the Confederacy, was still beating full and<br> strong, the railroads that were its arteries throbbing with the<br> never-ending flow of men, munitions and supplies.<br><br> <br><br> In other days, Scarlett would have been bitter about her shabby<br> dresses and patched shoes but now she did not care, for the one<br> person who mattered was not there to see her. She was happy those<br> two months, happier than she had been in years. Had she not felt<br> the start of Ashley's heart when her arms went round his neck? seen<br> that despairing look on his face which was more open an avowal than<br> any words could be? He loved her. She was sure of that now, and<br> this conviction was so pleasant she could even be kinder to<br> Melanie. She could be sorry for Melanie now, sorry with a faint<br> contempt for her blindness, her stupidity.<br><br> ‘When the war is over!’ she thought. ‘When it's over--then . . .’<br><br> Sometimes she thought with a small dart of fear: ‘What then?’ But<br> she put the thought from her mind. When the war was over,<br> everything would be settled, somehow. If Ashley loved her, he<br> simply couldn't go on living with Melanie.<br><br> But then, a divorce was unthinkable; and Ellen and Gerald, staunch<br> Catholics that they were, would never permit her to marry a<br> divorced man. It would mean leaving the Church! Scarlett thought<br> it over and decided that, in a choice between the Church and<br> Ashley, she would choose Ashley. But, oh, it would make such a<br> scandal! Divorced people were under the ban not only of the Church<br> but of society. No divorced person was received. However, she<br> would dare even that for Ashley. She would sacrifice anything for<br> Ashley.<br><br> Somehow it would come out all right when the war was over. If<br> Ashley loved her so much, he'd find a way. She'd make him find a<br> way. And with every day that passed, she became more sure in her<br> own mind of his devotion, more certain he would arrange matters<br> satisfactorily when the Yankees were finally beaten. Of course, he<br> had said the Yankees ‘had’ them. Scarlett thought that was just<br> foolishness. He had been tired and upset when he said it. But she<br> hardly cared whether the Yankees won or not. The thing that<br> mattered was for the war to finish quickly and for Ashley to come<br> home.<br><br> Then, when the sleets of March were keeping everyone indoors, the<br> hideous blow fell. Melanie, her eyes shining with joy, her head<br> ducked with embarrassed pride, told her she was going to have a<br> baby.<br><br> ‘Dr. Meade says it will be here in late August or September,’ she<br> said. ‘I've thought--but I wasn't sure till today. Oh, Scarlett,<br> isn't it wonderful? I've so envied you Wade and so wanted a baby.<br> And I was so afraid that maybe I wasn't ever going to have one and,<br> darling, I want a dozen!’<br><br> Scarlett had been combing her hair, preparing for bed, when Melanie<br> spoke and she stopped, the comb in mid-air.<br><br> ‘Dear God!’ she said and, for a moment, realization did not come.<br> Then there suddenly leaped to her mind the closed door of Melanie's<br> bedroom and a knifelike pain went through her, a pain as fierce as<br> though Ashley had been her own husband and had been unfaithful to<br> her. A baby. Ashley's baby. Oh, how could he, when he loved her<br> and not Melanie?<br><br> ‘I know you're surprised,’ Melanie rattled on, breathlessly. ‘And<br> isn't it too wonderful? Oh, Scarlett, I don't know how I shall<br> ever write Ashley! It wouldn't be so embarrassing if I could tell<br> him or--or--well, not say anything and just let him notice<br> gradually, you know--’<br><br> ‘Dear God!’ said Scarlett, almost sobbing, as she dropped the comb<br> and caught at the marble top of the dresser for support.<br><br> ‘Darling, don't look like that! You know having a baby isn't so<br> bad. You said so yourself. And you mustn't worry about me, though<br> you are sweet to be so upset. Of course, Dr. Meade said I was--<br> was,’ Melanie blushed, ‘quite narrow but that perhaps I shouldn't<br> have any trouble and--Scarlett, did you write Charlie and tell him<br> when you found out about Wade, or did your mother do it or maybe<br> Mr. O'Hara? Oh, dear, if I only had a mother to do it! I just<br> don't see how--’<br><br> ‘Hush!’ said Scarlett, violently. ‘Hush!’<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett, I'm so stupid! I'm sorry. I guess all happy people<br> are selfish. I forgot about Charlie, just for the moment--’<br><br> ‘Hush!’ said Scarlett again, fighting to control her face and make<br> her emotions quiet. Never, never must Melanie see or suspect how<br> she felt.<br><br> Melanie, the most tactful of women, had tears in her eyes at her<br> own cruelty. How could she have brought back to Scarlett the<br> terrible memories of Wade being born months after poor Charlie was<br> dead? How could she have been so thoughtless?<br><br> ‘Let me help you undress, dearest,’ she said humbly. ‘And I'll rub<br> your head for you.’<br><br> ‘You leave me alone,’ said Scarlett, her face like stone. And<br> Melanie, bursting into tears of self-condemnation, fled the room,<br> leaving Scarlett to a tearless bed, with wounded pride,<br> disillusionment and jealousy for bedfellows.<br><br> She thought that she could not live any longer in the same house<br> with the woman who was carrying Ashley's child, thought that she<br> would go home to Tara, home, where she belonged. She did not see<br> how she could ever look at Melanie again and not have her secret<br> read in her face. And she arose the next morning with the fixed<br> intention of packing her trunk immediately after breakfast. But,<br> as they sat at the table, Scarlett silent and gloomy, Pitty<br> bewildered and Melanie miserable, a telegram came.<br><br> It was to Melanie from Ashley's body servant, Mose.<br><br> ‘I have looked everywhere and I can't find him. Must I come home?’<br><br> No one knew what it meant but the eyes of the three women went to<br> one another, wide with terror, and Scarlett forgot all thoughts of<br> going home. Without finishing their breakfasts they drove down to<br> telegraph Ashley's colonel, but even as they entered the office,<br> there was a telegram from him.<br><br> ‘Regret to inform you Major Wilkes missing since scouting<br> expedition three days ago. Will keep you informed.’<br><br> It was a ghastly trip home, with Aunt Pitty crying into her<br> handkerchief, Melanie sitting erect and white and Scarlett slumped,<br> stunned in the corner of the carriage. Once in the house, Scarlett<br> stumbled up the stairs to her bedroom and, clutching her Rosary<br> from the table, dropped to her knees and tried to pray. But the<br> prayers would not come. There only fell on her an abysmal fear, a<br> certain knowledge that God had turned His face from her for her<br> sin. She had loved a married man and tried to take him from his<br> wife, and God had punished her by killing him. She wanted to pray<br> but she could not raise her eyes to Heaven. She wanted to cry but<br> the tears would not come. They seemed to flood her chest, and they<br> were hot tears that burned under her bosom, but they would not<br> flow.<br><br> Her door opened and Melanie entered. Her face was like a heart cut<br> from white paper, framed against black hair, and her eyes were<br> wide, like those of a frightened child lost in the dark.<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ she said, putting out her hands. ‘You must forgive me<br> for what I said yesterday, for you're--all I've got now. Oh,<br> Scarlett, I know my darling is dead!’<br><br> Somehow, she was in Scarlett's arms, her small breasts heaving with<br> sobs, and somehow they were lying on the bed, holding each other<br> close, and Scarlett was crying too, crying with her face pressed<br> close against Melanie's, the tears of one wetting the cheeks of the<br> other. It hurt so terribly to cry, but not so much as not being<br> able to cry. Ashley is dead--dead, she thought, and I have killed<br> him by loving him! Fresh sobs broke from her, and Melanie somehow<br> feeling comfort in her tears tightened her arms about her neck.<br><br> ‘At least,’ she whispered, ‘at least--I've got his baby.’<br><br> ‘And I,’ thought Scarlett, too stricken now for anything so petty<br> as jealousy, ‘I've got nothing--nothing--nothing except the look on<br> his face when he told me good-by.’<br><br> <br><br> The first reports were ‘Missing--believed killed’ and so they<br> appeared on the casualty list. Melanie telegraphed Colonel Sloan a<br> dozen times and finally a letter arrived, full of sympathy,<br> explaining that Ashley and a squad had ridden out on a scouting<br> expedition and had not returned. There had been reports of a<br> slight skirmish within the Yankee lines and Mose, frantic with<br> grief, had risked his own life to search for Ashley's body but had<br> found nothing. Melanie, strangely calm now, telegraphed him money<br> and instructions to come home.<br><br> When ‘Missing--believed captured’ appeared on the casualty lists,<br> joy and hope reanimated the sad household. Melanie could hardly be<br> dragged away from the telegraph office and she met every train<br> hoping for letters. She was sick now, her pregnancy making itself<br> felt in many unpleasant ways, but she refused to obey Dr. Meade's<br> commands and stay in bed. A feverish energy possessed her and<br> would not let her be still; and at night, long after Scarlett had<br> gone to bed, she could hear her walking the floor in the next room.<br><br> One afternoon, she came home from town, driven by the frightened<br> Uncle Peter and supported by Rhett Butler. She had fainted at the<br> telegraph office and Rhett, passing by and observing the<br> excitement, had escorted her home. He carried her up the stairs to<br> her bedroom and while the alarmed household fled hither and yon for<br> hot bricks, blankets and whisky, he propped her on the pillows of<br> her bed.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Wilkes,’ he questioned abruptly, ‘you are going to have a<br> baby, are you not?’<br><br> Had Melanie not been so faint, so sick, so heartsore, she would<br> have collapsed at his question. Even with women friends she was<br> embarrassed by any mention of her condition, while visits to Dr.<br> Meade were agonizing experiences. And for a man, especially Rhett<br> Butler, to ask such a question was unthinkable. But lying weak and<br> forlorn in the bed, she could only nod. After she had nodded, it<br> did not seem so dreadful, for he looked so kind and so concerned.<br><br> ‘Then you must take better care of yourself. All this running<br> about and worry won't help you and may harm the baby. If you will<br> permit me, Mrs. Wilkes, I will use what influence I have in<br> Washington to learn about Mr. Wilkes' fate. If he is a prisoner,<br> he will be on the Federal lists, and if he isn't--well, there's<br> nothing worse than uncertainty. But I must have your promise.<br> Take care of yourself or, before God, I won't turn a hand.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you are so kind,’ cried Melanie. ‘How can people say such<br> dreadful things about you?’ Then overcome with the knowledge of<br> her tactlessness and also with horror at having discussed her<br> condition with a man, she began to cry weakly. And Scarlett,<br> flying up the stairs with a hot brick wrapped in flannel, found<br> Rhett patting her hand.<br><br> He was as good as his word. They never knew what wires he pulled.<br> They feared to ask, knowing it might involve an admission of his<br> too close affiliations with the Yankees. It was a month before he<br> had news, news that raised them to the heights when they first<br> heard it, but later created a gnawing anxiety in their hearts.<br><br> Ashley was not dead! He had been wounded and taken prisoner, and<br> the records showed that he was at Rock Island, a prison camp in<br> Illinois. In their first joy, they could think of nothing except<br> that he was alive. But, when calmness began to return, they looked<br> at one another and said ‘Rock Island!’ in the same voice they would<br> have said ‘In Hell!’ For even as Andersonville was a name that<br> stank in the North, so was Rock Island one to bring terror to the<br> heart of any Southerner who had relatives imprisoned there.<br><br> When Lincoln refused to exchange prisoners, believing it would<br> hasten the end of the war to burden the Confederacy with the<br> feeding and guarding of Union prisoners, there were thousands of<br> bluecoats at Andersonville, Georgia. The Confederates were on<br> scant rations and practically without drugs or bandages for their<br> own sick and wounded. They had little to share with the prisoners.<br> They fed their prisoners on what the soldiers in the field were<br> eating, fat pork and dried peas, and on this diet the Yankees died<br> like flies, sometimes a hundred a day. Inflamed by the reports,<br> the North resorted to harsher treatment of Confederate prisoners<br> and at no place were conditions worse than at Rock Island. Food<br> was scanty, one blanket for three men, and the ravages of smallpox,<br> pneumonia and typhoid gave the place the name of a pest-house.<br> Three-fourths of all the men sent there never came out alive.<br><br> And Ashley was in that horrible place! Ashley was alive but he was<br> wounded and at Rock Island, and the snow must have been deep in<br> Illinois when he was taken there. Had he died of his wound, since<br> Rhett had learned his news? Had he fallen victim to smallpox? Was<br> he delirious with pneumonia and no blanket to cover him?<br><br> ‘Oh, Captain Butler, isn't there some way-- Can't you use your<br> influence and have him exchanged?’ cried Melanie.<br><br> ‘Mr. Lincoln, the merciful and just, who cries large tears over<br> Mrs. Bixby's five boys, hasn't any tears to shed about the<br> thousands of Yankees dying at Andersonville,’ said Rhett, his mouth<br> twisting. ‘He doesn't care if they all die. The order is out. No<br> exchanges. I--I hadn't told you before, Mrs. Wilkes, but your<br> husband had a chance to get out and refused it.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no!’ cried Melanie in disbelief.<br><br> ‘Yes, indeed. The Yankees are recruiting men for frontier service<br> to fight the Indians, recruiting them from among Confederate<br> prisoners. Any prisoner who will take the oath of allegiance and<br> enlist for Indian service for two years will be released and sent<br> West. Mr. Wilkes refused.’<br><br> ‘Oh, how could he?’ cried Scarlett. ‘Why didn't he take the oath<br> and then desert and come home as soon as he got out of jail?’<br><br> Melanie turned on her like a small fury.<br><br> ‘How can you even suggest that he would do such a thing? Betray<br> his own Confederacy by taking that vile oath and then betray his<br> word to the Yankees! I would rather know he was dead at Rock<br> Island than hear he had taken that oath. I'd be proud of him if he<br> died in prison. But if he did THAT, I would never look on his face<br> again. Never! Of course, he refused.’<br><br> When Scarlett was seeing Rhett to the door, she asked indignantly:<br> ‘If it were you, wouldn't you enlist with the Yankees to keep from<br> dying in that place and then desert?’<br><br> ‘Of course,’ said Rhett, his teeth showing beneath his mustache.<br><br> ‘Then why didn't Ashley do it?’<br><br> ‘He's a gentleman,’ said Rhett, and Scarlett wondered how it was<br> possible to convey such cynicism and contempt in that one honorable<br> word.</p><br>PART THREE<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XVII<br><br> <br> May of 1864 came--a hot dry May that wilted the flowers in the<br> buds--and the Yankees under General Sherman were in Georgia again,<br> above Dalton, one hundred miles northwest of Atlanta. Rumor had it<br> that there would be heavy fighting up there near the boundary<br> between Georgia and Tennessee. The Yankees were massing for an<br> attack on the Western and Atlantic Railroad, the line which<br> connected Atlanta with Tennessee and the West, the same line over<br> which the Southern troops had been rushed last fall to win the<br> victory at Chickamauga.<br><br> But, for the most part, Atlanta was not disturbed by the prospect<br> of fighting near Dalton. The place where the Yankees were<br> concentrating was only a few miles southeast of the battle field of<br> Chickamauga. They had been driven back once when they had tried to<br> break through the mountain passes of that region, and they would be<br> driven back again.<br><br> Atlanta--and all of Georgia--knew that the state was far too<br> important to the Confederacy for General Joe Johnston to let the<br> Yankees remain inside the state's borders for long. Old Joe and<br> his army would not let even one Yankee get south of Dalton, for too<br> much depended on the undisturbed functioning of Georgia. The<br> unravaged state was a vast granary, machine shop and storehouse for<br> the Confederacy. It manufactured much of the powder and arms used<br> by the army and most of the cotton and woolen goods. Lying between<br> Atlanta and Dalton was the city of Rome with its cannon foundry and<br> its other industries, and Etowah and Allatoona with the largest<br> ironworks south of Richmond. And, in Atlanta, were not only the<br> factories for making pistols and saddles, tents and ammunition, but<br> also the most extensive rolling mills in the South, the shops of<br> the principal railroads and the enormous hospitals. And in Atlanta<br> was the junction of the four railroads on which the very life of<br> the Confederacy depended.<br><br> So no one worried particularly. After all, Dalton was a long way<br> off, up near the Tennessee line. There had been fighting in<br> Tennessee for three years and people were accustomed to the thought<br> of that state as a far-away battle field, almost as far away as<br> Virginia or the Mississippi River. Moreover, Old Joe and his men<br> were between the Yankees and Atlanta, and everyone knew that, next<br> to General Lee himself, there was no greater general than Johnston,<br> now that Stonewall Jackson was dead.<br><br> Dr. Meade summed up the civilian point of view on the matter, one<br> warm May evening on the veranda of Aunt Pitty's house, when he said<br> that Atlanta had nothing to fear, for General Johnston was standing<br> in the mountains like an iron rampart. His audience heard him with<br> varying emotions, for all who sat there rocking quietly in the<br> fading twilight, watching the first fireflies of the season moving<br> magically through the dusk, had weighty matters on their minds.<br> Mrs. Meade, her hand upon Phil's arm, was hoping the doctor was<br> right. If the war came closer, she knew that Phil would have to<br> go. He was sixteen now and in the Home Guard. Fanny Elsing, pale<br> and hollow eyed since Gettysburg, was trying to keep her mind from<br> the torturing picture which had worn a groove in her tired mind<br> these past several months--Lieutenant Dallas McLure dying in a<br> jolting ox cart in the rain on the long, terrible retreat into<br> Maryland.<br><br> Captain Carey Ashburn's useless arm was hurting him again and<br> moreover he was depressed by the thought that his courtship of<br> Scarlett was at a standstill. That had been the situation ever<br> since the news of Ashley Wilkes' capture, though the connection<br> between the two events did not occur to him. Scarlett and Melanie<br> both were thinking of Ashley, as they always did when urgent tasks<br> or the necessity of carrying on a conversation did not divert them.<br> Scarlett was thinking bitterly, sorrowfully: He must be dead or<br> else we would have heard. Melanie, stemming the tide of fear again<br> and again, through endless hours, was telling herself: ‘He can't<br> be dead. I'd know it--I'd feel it if he were dead.’ Rhett Butler<br> lounged in the shadows, his long legs in their elegant boots<br> crossed negligently, his dark face an unreadable blank. In his<br> arms Wade slept contentedly, a cleanly picked wishbone in his small<br> hand. Scarlett always permitted Wade to sit up late when Rhett<br> called because the shy child was fond of him, and Rhett oddly<br> enough seemed to be fond of Wade. Generally Scarlett was annoyed<br> by the child's presence, but he always behaved nicely in Rhett's<br> arms. As for Aunt Pitty, she was nervously trying to stifle a<br> belch, for the rooster they had had for supper was a tough old<br> bird.<br><br> That morning Aunt Pitty had reached the regretful decision that she<br> had better kill the patriarch before he died of old age and pining<br> for his harem which had long since been eaten. For days he had<br> drooped about the empty chicken run, too dispirited to crow. After<br> Uncle Peter had wrung his neck, Aunt Pitty had been beset by<br> conscience at the thought of enjoying him, en famille, when so many<br> of her friends had not tasted chicken for weeks, so she suggested<br> company for dinner. Melanie, who was now in her fifth month, had<br> not been out in public or received guests for weeks, and she was<br> appalled at the idea. But Aunt Pitty, for once, was firm. It<br> would be selfish to eat the rooster alone, and if Melanie would<br> only move her top hoop a little higher no one would notice anything<br> and she was so flat in the bust anyway.<br><br> ‘Oh, but Auntie I don't want to see people when Ashley--’<br><br> ‘It isn't as if Ashley were--had passed away,’ said Aunt Pitty, her<br> voice quavering, for in her heart she was certain Ashley was dead.<br> ‘He's just as much alive as you are and it will do you good to have<br> company. And I'm going to ask Fanny Elsing, too. Mrs. Elsing<br> begged me to try to do something to arouse her and make her see<br> people--’<br><br> ‘Oh, but Auntie, it's cruel to force her when poor Dallas has only<br> been dead--’<br><br> ‘Now, Melly, I shall cry with vexation if you argue with me. I<br> guess I'm your auntie and I know what's what. And I want a party.’<br><br> So Aunt Pitty had her party, and, at the last minute, a guest she<br> did not expect, or desire, arrived. Just when the smell of roast<br> rooster was filling the house, Rhett Butler, back from one of his<br> mysterious trips, knocked at the door, with a large box of bonbons<br> packed in paper lace under his arm and a mouthful of two-edged<br> compliments for her. There was nothing to do but invite him to<br> stay, although Aunt Pitty knew how the doctor and Mrs. Meade felt<br> about him and how bitter Fanny was against any man not in uniform.<br> Neither the Meades nor the Elsings would have spoken to him on the<br> street, but in a friend's home they would, of course, have to be<br> polite to him. Besides, he was now more firmly than ever under the<br> protection of the fragile Melanie. After he had intervened for her<br> to get the news about Ashley, she had announced publicly that her<br> home was open to him as long as he lived and no matter what other<br> people might say about him.<br><br> Aunt Pitty's apprehensions quieted when she saw that Rhett was on<br> his best behavior. He devoted himself to Fanny with such<br> sympathetic deference she even smiled at him, and the meal went<br> well. It was a princely feast. Carey Ashburn had brought a little<br> tea, which he had found in the tobacco pouch of a captured Yankee<br> en route to Andersonville, and everyone had a cup, faintly flavored<br> with tobacco. There was a nibble of the tough old bird for each,<br> an adequate amount of dressing made of corn meal and seasoned with<br> onions, a bowl of dried peas, and plenty of rice and gravy, the<br> latter somewhat watery, for there was no flour with which to<br> thicken it. For dessert, there was a sweet potato pie followed by<br> Rhett's bonbons, and when Rhett produced real Havana cigars for the<br> gentlemen to enjoy over their glass of blackberry wine, everyone<br> agreed it was indeed a Lucullan banquet.<br><br> When the gentlemen joined the ladies on the front porch, the talk<br> turned to war. Talk always turned to war now, all conversations on<br> any topic led from war or back to war--sometimes sad, often gay,<br> but always war. War romances, war weddings, deaths in hospitals<br> and on the field, incidents of camp and battle and march,<br> gallantry, cowardice, humor, sadness, deprivation and hope.<br> Always, always hope. Hope firm, unshaken despite the defeats of<br> the summer before.<br><br> When Captain Ashburn announced he had applied for and been granted<br> transfer from Atlanta to the army at Dalton, the ladies kissed his<br> stiffened arm with their eyes and covered their emotions of pride<br> by declaring he couldn't go, for then who would beau them about?<br><br> Young Carey looked confused and pleased at hearing such statements<br> from settled matrons and spinsters like Mrs. Meade and Melanie and<br> Aunt Pitty and Fanny, and tried to hope that Scarlett really meant<br> it.<br><br> ‘Why, he'll be back in no time,’ said the doctor, throwing an arm<br> over Carey's shoulder. ‘There'll be just one brief skirmish and<br> the Yankees will skedaddle back into Tennessee. And when they get<br> there, General Forrest will take care of them. You ladies need<br> have no alarm about the proximity of the Yankees, for General<br> Johnston and his army stands there in the mountains like an iron<br> rampart. Yes, an iron rampart,’ he repeated, relishing his phrase.<br> ‘Sherman will never pass. He'll never dislodge Old Joe.’<br><br> The ladies smiled approvingly, for his lightest utterance was<br> regarded as incontrovertible truth. After all, men understood<br> these matters much better than women, and if he said General<br> Johnston was an iron rampart, he must be one. Only Rhett spoke.<br> He had been silent since supper and had sat in the twilight<br> listening to the war talk with a down-twisted mouth, holding the<br> sleeping child against his shoulder.<br><br> ‘I believe that rumor has it that Sherman has over one hundred<br> thousand men, now that his reinforcements have come up?’<br><br> The doctor answered him shortly. He had been under considerable<br> strain ever since he first arrived and found that one of his fellow<br> diners was this man whom he disliked so heartily. Only the respect<br> due Miss Pittypat and his presence under her roof as a guest had<br> restrained him from showing his feelings more obviously.<br><br> ‘Well, sir?’ the doctor barked in reply.<br><br> ‘I believe Captain Ashburn said just a while ago that General<br> Johnston had only about forty thousand, counting the deserters who<br> were encouraged to come back to the colors by the last victory.’<br><br> ‘Sir,’ said Mrs. Meade indignantly. ‘There are no deserters in the<br> Confederate army.’<br><br> ‘I beg your pardon,’ said Rhett with mock humility. ‘I meant those<br> thousands on furlough who forgot to rejoin their regiments and<br> those who have been over their wounds for six months but who remain<br> at home, going about their usual business or doing the spring<br> plowing.’<br><br> His eyes gleamed and Mrs. Meade bit her lip in a huff. Scarlett<br> wanted to giggle at her discomfiture, for Rhett had caught her<br> fairly. There were hundreds of men skulking in the swamps and the<br> mountains, defying the provost guard to drag them back to the army.<br> They were the ones who declared it was a ‘rich man's war and a poor<br> man's fight’ and they had had enough of it. But outnumbering these<br> by far were men who, though carried on company rolls as deserters,<br> had no intention of deserting permanently. They were the ones who<br> had waited three years in vain for furloughs and while they waited<br> received ill-spelled letters from home: ‘We air hungry’ ‘There<br> won't be no crop this year--there ain't nobody to plow.’ ‘We air<br> hungry.’ ‘The commissary took the shoats, and we ain't had no<br> money from you in months. We air livin' on dried peas.’<br><br> Always the rising chorus swelled: ‘We are hungry, your wife, your<br> babies, your parents. When will it be over? When will you come<br> home? We are hungry, hungry.’ When furloughs from the rapidly<br> thinning army were denied, these soldiers went home without them,<br> to plow their land and plant their crops, repair their houses and<br> build up their fences. When regimental officers, understanding the<br> situation, saw a hard fight ahead, they wrote these men, telling<br> them to rejoin their companies and no questions would be asked.<br> Usually the men returned when they saw that hunger at home would be<br> held at bay for a few months longer. ‘Plow furloughs’ were not<br> looked upon in the same light as desertion in the face of the<br> enemy, but they weakened the army just the same.<br><br> Dr. Meade hastily bridged over the uncomfortable pause, his voice<br> cold: ‘Captain Butler, the numerical difference between our troops<br> and those of the Yankees has never mattered. One Confederate is<br> worth a dozen Yankees.’<br><br> The ladies nodded. Everyone knew that.<br><br> ‘That was true at the first of the war,’ said Rhett. ‘Perhaps it's<br> still true, provided the Confederate soldier has bullets for his<br> gun and shoes on his feet and food in his stomach. Eh, Captain<br> Ashburn?’<br><br> His voice was still soft and filled with specious humility. Carey<br> Ashburn looked unhappy, for it was obvious that he, too, disliked<br> Rhett intensely. He gladly would have sided with the doctor but he<br> could not lie. The reason he had applied for transfer to the<br> front, despite his useless arm, was that he realized, as the<br> civilian population did not, the seriousness of the situation.<br> There were many other men, stumping on wooden pegs, blind in one<br> eye, fingers blown away, one arm gone, who were quietly transferring<br> from the commissariat, hospital duties, mail and railroad service<br> back to their old fighting units. They knew Old Joe needed every<br> man.<br><br> He did not speak and Dr. Meade thundered, losing his temper: ‘Our<br> men have fought without shoes before and without food and won<br> victories. And they will fight again and win! I tell you General<br> Johnston cannot be dislodged! The mountain fastnesses have always<br> been the refuge and the strong forts of invaded peoples from<br> ancient times. Think of--think of Thermopylae!’<br><br> Scarlett thought hard but Thermopylae meant nothing to her.<br><br> ‘They died to the last man at Thermopylae, didn't they, Doctor?’<br> Rhett asked, and his lips twitched with suppressed laughter.<br><br> ‘Are you being insulting, young man?’<br><br> ‘Doctor! I beg of you! You misunderstood me! I merely asked for<br> information. My memory of ancient history is poor.’<br><br> ‘If need be, our army will die to the last man before they permit<br> the Yankees to advance farther into Georgia,’ snapped the doctor.<br> ‘But it will not be. They will drive them out of Georgia in one<br> skirmish.’<br><br> Aunt Pittypat rose hastily and asked Scarlett to favor them with a<br> piano selection and a song. She saw that the conversation was<br> rapidly getting into deep and stormy water. She had known very<br> well there would be trouble if she invited Rhett to supper. There<br> was always trouble when he was present. Just how he started it,<br> she never exactly understood. Dear! Dear! What did Scarlett see<br> in the man? And how could dear Melly defend him?<br><br> As Scarlett went obediently into the parlor, a silence fell on the<br> porch, a silence that pulsed with resentment toward Rhett. How<br> could anyone not believe with heart and soul in the invincibility<br> of General Johnston and his men? Believing was a sacred duty. And<br> those who were so traitorous as not to believe should, at least,<br> have the decency to keep their mouths shut.<br><br> Scarlett struck a few chords and her voice floated out to them from<br> the parlor, sweetly, sadly, in the words of a popular song:<br><br> <br> ‘Into a ward of whitewashed walls<br> Where the dead and dying lay--<br> Wounded with bayonets, shells and balls--<br> Somebody's darling was borne one day.<br><br> ‘Somebody's darling! so young and so brave!<br> Wearing still on his pale, sweet face--<br> Soon to be hid by the dust of the grave--<br> The lingering light of his boyhood's grace.’<br><br> <br> ‘Matted and damp are the curls of gold,’ mourned Scarlett's faulty<br> soprano, and Fanny half rose and said in a faint, strangled voice:<br> ‘Sing something else!’<br><br> The piano was suddenly silent as Scarlett was overtaken with<br> surprise and embarrassment. Then she hastily blundered into the<br> opening bars of ‘Jacket of Gray’ and stopped with a discord as she<br> remembered how heartrending that selection was too. The piano was<br> silent again for she was utterly at a loss. All the songs had to<br> do with death and parting and sorrow.<br><br> Rhett rose swiftly, deposited Wade in Fanny's lap, and went into<br> the parlor.<br><br> ‘Play 'My Old Kentucky Home,'‘ he suggested smoothly, and Scarlett<br> gratefully plunged into it. Her voice was joined by Rhett's<br> excellent bass, and as they went into the second verse those on the<br> porch breathed more easily, though Heaven knew it was none too<br> cheery a song, either.<br><br> <br> ‘Just a few more days for to tote the weary load!<br> No matter, 'twill never be light!<br> Just a few more days, till we totter in the road!<br> Then, my old Kentucky home, good night!’<br><br> <br><br> Dr. Meade's prediction was right--as far as it went. Johnston did<br> stand like an iron rampart in the mountains above Dalton, one<br> hundred miles away. So firmly did he stand and so bitterly did he<br> contest Sherman's desire to pass down the valley toward Atlanta<br> that finally the Yankees drew back and took counsel with<br> themselves. They could not break the gray lines by direct assault<br> and so, under cover of night, they marched through the mountain<br> passes in a semicircle, hoping to come upon Johnston's rear and cut<br> the railroad behind him at Resaca, fifteen miles below Dalton.<br><br> With those precious twin lines of iron in danger, the Confederates<br> left their desperately defended rifle pits and, under the<br> starlight, made a forced march to Resaca by the short, direct road.<br> When the Yankees, swarming out of the hills, came upon them, the<br> Southern troops were waiting for them, entrenched behind<br> breastworks, batteries planted, bayonets gleaming, even as they had<br> been at Dalton.<br><br> When the wounded from Dalton brought in garbled accounts of Old<br> Joe's retreat to Resaca, Atlanta was surprised and a little<br> disturbed. It was as though a small, dark cloud had appeared in<br> the northwest, the first cloud of a summer storm. What was the<br> General thinking about, letting the Yankees penetrate eighteen<br> miles farther into Georgia? The mountains were natural fortresses,<br> even as Dr. Meade had said. Why hadn't Old Joe held the Yankees<br> there?<br><br> Johnston fought desperately at Resaca and repulsed the Yankees<br> again, but Sherman, employing the same flanking movement, swung his<br> vast army in another semicircle, crossed the Oostanaula River and<br> again struck at the railroad in the Confederate rear. Again the<br> gray lines were summoned swiftly from their red ditches to defend<br> the railroad, and, weary for sleep, exhausted from marching and<br> fighting, and hungry, always hungry, they made another rapid march<br> down the valley. They reached the little town of Calhoun, six<br> miles below Resaca, ahead of the Yankees, entrenched and were again<br> ready for the attack when the Yankees came up. The attack came,<br> there was fierce skirmishing and the Yankees were beaten back.<br> Wearily the Confederates lay on their arms and prayed for respite<br> and rest. But there was no rest. Sherman inexorably advanced,<br> step by step, swinging his army about them in a wide curve, forcing<br> another retreat to defend the railroad at their back.<br><br> The Confederates marched in their sleep, too tired to think for the<br> most part. But when they did think, they trusted old Joe. They<br> knew they were retreating but they knew they had not been beaten.<br> They just didn't have enough men to hold their entrenchments and<br> defeat Sherman's flanking movements, too. They could and did lick<br> the Yankees every time the Yankees would stand and fight. What<br> would be the end of this retreat, they did not know. But Old Joe<br> knew what he was doing and that was enough for them. He had<br> conducted the retreat in masterly fashion, for they had lost few<br> men and the Yankees killed and captured ran high. They hadn't lost<br> a single wagon and only four guns. And they hadn't lost the<br> railroad at their back, either. Sherman hadn't laid a finger on it<br> for all his frontal attacks, cavalry dashes and flank movements.<br><br> The railroad. It was still theirs, that slender iron line winding<br> through the sunny valley toward Atlanta. Men lay down to sleep<br> where they could see the rails gleaming faintly in the starlight.<br> Men lay down to die, and the last sight that met their puzzled eyes<br> was the rails shining in the merciless sun, heat shimmering along<br> them.<br><br> As they fell back down the valley, an army of refugees fell back<br> before them. Planters and Crackers, rich and poor, black and<br> white, women and children, the old, the dying, the crippled, the<br> wounded, the women far gone in pregnancy, crowded the road to<br> Atlanta on trains, afoot, on horseback, in carriages and wagons<br> piled high with trunks and household goods. Five miles ahead of<br> the retreating army went the refugees, halting at Resaca, at<br> Calhoun, at Kingston, hoping at each stop to hear that the Yankees<br> had been driven back so they could return to their homes. But<br> there was no retracing that sunny road. The gray troops passed by<br> empty mansions, deserted farms, lonely cabins with doors ajar.<br> Here and there some lone woman remained with a few frightened<br> slaves, and they came to the road to cheer the soldiers, to bring<br> buckets of well water for the thirsty men, to bind up the wounds<br> and bury the dead in their own family burying grounds. But for the<br> most part the sunny valley was abandoned and desolate and the<br> untended crops stood in parching fields.<br><br> Flanked again at Calhoun, Johnston fell back to Adairsville, where<br> there was sharp skirmishing, then to Cassville, then south of<br> Cartersville. And the enemy had now advanced fifty-five miles from<br> Dalton. At New Hope Church, fifteen miles farther along the hotly<br> fought way, the gray ranks dug in for a determined stand. On came<br> the blue lines, relentlessly, like a monster serpent, coiling,<br> striking venomously, drawing its injured lengths back, but always<br> striking again. There was desperate fighting at New Hope Church,<br> eleven days of continuous fighting, with every Yankee assault<br> bloodily repulsed. Then Johnston, flanked again, withdrew his<br> thinning lines a few miles farther.<br><br> The Confederate dead and wounded at New Hope Church ran high. The<br> wounded flooded Atlanta in train-loads and the town was appalled.<br> Never, even after the battle of Chickamauga, had the town seen so<br> many wounded. The hospitals overflowed and wounded lay on the<br> floors of empty stores and upon cotton bales in the warehouses.<br> Every hotel, boarding house and private residence was crowded with<br> sufferers. Aunt Pitty had her share, although she protested that<br> it was most unbecoming to have strange men in the house when<br> Melanie was in a delicate condition and when gruesome sights might<br> bring on premature birth. But Melanie reefed up her top hoop a<br> little higher to hide her thickening figure and the wounded invaded<br> the brick house. There was endless cooking and lifting and turning<br> and fanning, endless hours of washing and rerolling bandages and<br> picking lint, and endless warm nights made sleepless by the<br> babbling delirium of men in the next room. Finally the choked town<br> could take care of no more and the overflow of wounded was sent on<br> to the hospitals at Macon and Augusta.<br><br> With this backwash of wounded bearing conflicting reports and the<br> increase of frightened refugees crowding into the already crowded<br> town, Atlanta was in an uproar. The small cloud on the horizon had<br> blown up swiftly into a large, sullen storm cloud and it was as<br> though a faint, chilling wind blew from it.<br><br> No one had lost faith in the invincibility of the troops but<br> everyone, the civilians at least, had lost faith in the General.<br> New Hope Church was only thirty-five miles from Atlanta! The<br> General had let the Yankees push him back sixty-five miles in three<br> weeks! Why didn't he hold the Yankees instead of everlastingly<br> retreating? He was a fool and worse than a fool. Graybeards in<br> the Home Guard and members of the state militia, safe in Atlanta,<br> insisted they could have managed the campaign better and drew maps<br> on tablecloths to prove their contentions. As his lines grew<br> thinner and he was forced back farther, the General called<br> desperately on Governor Brown for these very men, but the state<br> troops felt reasonably safe. After all, the Governor had defied<br> Jeff Davis' demand for them. Why should he accede to General<br> Johnston?<br><br> Fight and fall back! Fight and fall back! For seventy miles and<br> twenty-five days the Confederates had fought almost daily. New<br> Hope Church was behind the gray troops now, a memory in a mad haze<br> of like memories, heat, dust, hunger, weariness, tramp-tramp on the<br> red rutted roads, slop-slop through the red mud, retreat, entrench,<br> fight--retreat, entrench, fight. New Hope Church was a nightmare<br> of another life and so was Big Shanty, where they turned and fought<br> the Yankees like demons. But, fight the Yankees till the fields<br> were blue with dead, there were always more Yankees, fresh Yankees;<br> there was always that sinister southeast curving of the blue lines<br> toward the Confederate rear, toward the railroad--and toward<br> Atlanta!<br><br> From Big Shanty, the weary sleepless lines retreated down the road<br> to Kennesaw Mountain, near the little town of Marietta, and here<br> they spread their lines in a ten-mile curve. On the steep sides of<br> the mountain they dug their rifle pits and on the towering heights<br> they planted their batteries. Swearing, sweating men hauled the<br> heavy guns up the precipitous slopes, for mules could not climb the<br> hillsides. Couriers and wounded coming into Atlanta gave<br> reassuring reports to the frightened townspeople. The heights of<br> Kennesaw were impregnable. So were Pine Mountain and Lost Mountain<br> near by which were also fortified. The Yankees couldn't dislodge<br> Old Joe's men and they could hardly flank them now for the<br> batteries on the mountain tops commanded all the roads for miles.<br> Atlanta breathed more easily, but--<br><br> But Kennesaw Mountain was only twenty-two miles away!<br><br> On the day when the first wounded from Kennesaw Mountain were<br> coming in, Mrs. Merriwether's carriage was at Aunt Pitty's house at<br> the unheard-of hour of seven in the morning, and black Uncle Levi<br> sent up word that Scarlett must dress immediately and come to the<br> hospital. Fanny Elsing and the Bonnell girls, roused early from<br> slumber, were yawning on the back seat and the Elsings' mammy sat<br> grumpily on the box, a basket of freshly laundered bandages on her<br> lap. Off Scarlett went, unwillingly for she had danced till dawn<br> the night before at the Home Guard's party and her feet were tired.<br> She silently cursed the efficient and indefatigable Mrs.<br> Merriwether, the wounded and the whole Southern Confederacy, as<br> Prissy buttoned her in her oldest and raggedest calico frock which<br> she used for hospital work. Gulping down the bitter brew of<br> parched corn and dried sweet potatoes that passed for coffee, she<br> went out to join the girls.<br><br> She was sick of all this nursing. This very day she would tell<br> Mrs. Merriwether that Ellen had written her to come home for a<br> visit. Much good this did her, for that worthy matron, her sleeves<br> rolled up, her stout figure swathed in a large apron, gave her one<br> sharp look and said: ‘Don't let me hear any more such foolishness,<br> Scarlett Hamilton. I'll write your mother today and tell her how<br> much we need you, and I'm sure she'll understand and let you stay.<br> Now, put on your apron and trot over to Dr. Meade. He needs<br> someone to help with the dressings.’<br><br> ‘Oh, God,’ thought Scarlett drearily, ‘that's just the trouble.<br> Mother will make me stay here and I shall die if I have to smell<br> these stinks any longer! I wish I was an old lady so I could bully<br> the young ones, instead of getting bullied--and tell old cats like<br> Mrs. Merriwether to go to Halifax!’<br><br> Yes, she was sick of the hospital, the foul smells, the lice, the<br> aching, unwashed bodies. If there had ever been any novelty and<br> romance about nursing, that had worn off a year ago. Besides,<br> these men wounded in the retreat were not so attractive as the<br> earlier ones had been. They didn't show the slightest interest in<br> her and they had very little to say beyond: ‘How's the fightin'<br> goin'? What's Old Joe doin' now? Mighty clever fellow, Old Joe.’<br> She didn't think Old Joe a mighty clever fellow. All he had done<br> was let the Yankees penetrate eighty-eight miles into Georgia. No,<br> they were not an attractive lot. Moreover, many of them were<br> dying, dying swiftly, silently, having little strength left to<br> combat the blood poisoning, gangrene, typhoid and pneumonia which<br> had set in before they could reach Atlanta and a doctor.<br><br> The day was hot and the flies came in the open windows in swarms,<br> fat lazy flies that broke the spirits of the men as pain could not.<br> The tide of smells and pain rose and rose about her. Perspiration<br> soaked through her freshly starched dress as she followed Dr. Meade<br> about, a basin in her hand.<br><br> Oh, the nausea of standing by the doctor, trying not to vomit when<br> his bright knife cut into mortifying flesh! And oh, the horror of<br> hearing the screams from the operating ward where amputations were<br> going on! And the sick, helpless sense of pity at the sight of<br> tense, white faces of mangled men waiting for the doctor to get to<br> them, men whose ears were filled with screams, men waiting for the<br> dreadful words: ‘I'm sorry, my boy, but that hand will have to<br> come off. Yes, yes, I know; but look, see those red streaks?<br> It'll have to come off.’<br><br> Chloroform was so scarce now it was used only for the worst<br> amputations and opium was a precious thing, used only to ease the<br> dying out of life, not the living out of pain. There was no<br> quinine and no iodine at all. Yes, Scarlett was sick of it all,<br> and that morning she wished that she, like Melanie, had the excuse<br> of pregnancy to offer. That was about the only excuse that was<br> socially acceptable for not nursing these days.<br><br> When noon came, she put off her apron and sneaked away from the<br> hospital while Mrs. Merriwether was busy writing a letter for a<br> gangling, illiterate mountaineer. Scarlett felt that she could<br> stand it no longer. It was an imposition on her and she knew that<br> when the wounded came in on the noon train there would be enough<br> work to keep her busy until night-fall--and probably without<br> anything to eat.<br><br> She went hastily up the two short blocks to Peachtree Street,<br> breathing the unfouled air in as deep gulps as her tightly laced<br> corset would permit. She was standing on the corner, uncertain as<br> to what she would do next, ashamed to go home to Aunt Pitty's but<br> determined not to go back to the hospital, when Rhett Butler drove<br> by.<br><br> ‘You look like the ragpicker's child,’ he observed, his eyes taking<br> in the mended lavender calico, streaked with perspiration and<br> splotched here and there with water which had slopped from the<br> basin. Scarlett was furious with embarrassment and indignation.<br> Why did he always notice women's clothing and why was he so rude as<br> to remark upon her present untidiness?<br><br> ‘I don't want to hear a word out of you. You get out and help me<br> in and drive me somewhere where nobody will see me. I won't go<br> back to the hospital if they hang me! My goodness, I didn't start<br> this war and I don't see any reason why I should be worked to death<br> and--’<br><br> ‘A traitor to Our Glorious Cause!’<br><br> ‘The pot's calling the kettle black. You help me in. I don't care<br> where you were going. You're going to take me riding now.’<br><br> He swung himself out of the carriage to the ground and she suddenly<br> thought how nice it was to see a man who was whole, who was not<br> minus eyes or limbs, or white with pain or yellow with malaria, and<br> who looked well fed and healthy. He was so well dressed too. His<br> coat and trousers were actually of the same material and they<br> fitted him, instead of hanging in folds or being almost too tight<br> for movement. And they were new, not ragged, with dirty bare flesh<br> and hairy legs showing through. He looked as if he had not a care<br> in the world and that in itself was startling these days, when<br> other men wore such worried, preoccupied, grim looks. His brown<br> face was bland and his mouth, red lipped, clear cut as a woman's,<br> frankly sensual, smiled carelessly as he lifted her into the<br> carriage.<br><br> The muscles of his big body rippled against his well-tailored<br> clothes, as he got in beside her, and, as always, the sense of his<br> great physical power struck her like a blow. She watched the swell<br> of his powerful shoulders against the cloth with a fascination that<br> was disturbing, a little frightening. His body seemed so tough and<br> hard, as tough and hard as his keen mind. His was such an easy,<br> graceful strength, lazy as a panther stretching in the sun, alert<br> as a panther to spring and strike.<br><br> ‘You little fraud,’ he said, clucking to the horse. ‘You dance all<br> night with the soldiers and give them roses and ribbons and tell<br> them how you'd die for the Cause, and when it comes to bandaging a<br> few wounds and picking off a few lice, you decamp hastily.’<br><br> ‘Can't you talk about something else and drive faster? It would be<br> just my luck for Grandpa Merriwether to come out of his store and<br> see me and tell old lady--I mean, Mrs. Merriwether.’<br><br> He touched up the mare with the whip and she trotted briskly across<br> Five Points and across the railroad tracks that cut the town in<br> two. The train bearing the wounded had already come in and the<br> litter bearers were working swiftly in the hot sun, transferring<br> wounded into ambulances and covered ordnance wagons. Scarlett had<br> no qualm of conscience as she watched them but only a feeling of<br> vast relief that she had made her escape.<br><br> ‘I'm just sick and tired of that old hospital,’ she said, settling<br> her billowing skirts and tying her bonnet bow more firmly under her<br> chin. ‘And every day more and more wounded come in. It's all<br> General Johnston's fault. If he'd just stood up to the Yankees at<br> Dalton, they'd have--’<br><br> ‘But he did stand up to the Yankees, you ignorant child. And if<br> he'd kept on standing there, Sherman would have flanked him and<br> crushed him between the two wings of his army. And he'd have lost<br> the railroad and the railroad is what Johnston is fighting for.’<br><br> ‘Oh, well,’ said Scarlett, on whom military strategy was utterly<br> lost. ‘It's his fault anyway. He ought to have done something<br> about it and I think he ought to be removed. Why doesn't he stand<br> and fight instead of retreating?’<br><br> ‘You are like everyone else, screaming 'Off with his head' because<br> he can't do the impossible. He was Jesus the Savior at Dalton, and<br> now he's Judas the Betrayer at Kennesaw Mountain, all in six weeks.<br> Yet, just let him drive the Yankees back twenty miles and he'll be<br> Jesus again. My child, Sherman has twice as many men as Johnston,<br> and he can afford to lose two men for every one of our gallant<br> laddies. And Johnston can't afford to lose a single man. He needs<br> reinforcements badly and what is he getting? 'Joe Brown's Pets.'<br> What a help they'll be!’<br><br> ‘Is the militia really going to be called out? The Home Guard,<br> too? I hadn't heard. How do you know?’<br><br> ‘There's a rumor floating about to that effect. The rumor arrived<br> on the train from Milledgeville this morning. Both the militia and<br> the Home Guards are going to be sent in to reinforce General<br> Johnston. Yes, Governor Brown's darlings are likely to smell<br> powder at last, and I imagine most of them will be much surprised.<br> Certainly they never expected to see action. The Governor as good<br> as promised them they wouldn't. Well, that's a good joke on them.<br> They thought they had bomb proofs because the Governor stood up to<br> even Jeff Davis and refused to send them to Virginia. Said they<br> were needed for the defense of their state. Who'd have ever<br> thought the war would come to their own back yard and they'd really<br> have to defend their state?’<br><br> ‘Oh, how can you laugh, you cruel thing! Think of the old<br> gentlemen and the little boys in the Home Guard! Why, little Phil<br> Meade will have to go and Grandpa Merriwether and Uncle Henry<br> Hamilton.’<br><br> ‘I'm not talking about the little boys and the Mexican War<br> veterans. I'm talking about brave young men like Willie Guinan who<br> like to wear pretty uniforms and wave swords--’<br><br> ‘And yourself!’<br><br> ‘My dear, that didn't hurt a bit! I wear no uniform and wave no<br> sword and the fortunes of the Confederacy mean nothing at all to<br> me. Moreover, I wouldn't be caught dead in the Home Guard or in<br> any army, for that matter. I had enough of things military at West<br> Point to do me the rest of my life. . . . Well, I wish Old Joe<br> luck. General Lee can't send him any help because the Yankees are<br> keeping him busy in Virginia. So the Georgia state troops are the<br> only reinforcements Johnston can get. He deserves better, for he's<br> a great strategist. He always manages to get places before the<br> Yankees do. But he'll have to keep falling back if he wants to<br> protect the railroad; and mark my words, when they push him out of<br> the mountains and onto the flatter land around here, he's going to<br> be butchered.’<br><br> ‘Around here?’ cried Scarlett. ‘You know mighty well the Yankees<br> will never get this far!’<br><br> ‘Kennesaw is only twenty-two miles away and I'll wager you--’<br><br> ‘Rhett, look, down the street! That crowd of men! They aren't<br> soldiers. What on earth . . . ? Why, they're darkies!’<br><br> There was a great cloud of red dust coming up the street and from<br> the cloud came the sound of the tramping of many feet and a hundred<br> or more negro voices, deep throated, careless, singing a hymn.<br> Rhett pulled the carriage over to the curb, and Scarlett looked<br> curiously at the sweating black men, picks and shovels over their<br> shoulders, shepherded along by an officer and a squad of men<br> wearing the insignia of the engineering corps.<br><br> ‘What on earth . . . ?’ she began again.<br><br> Then her eyes lighted on a singing black buck in the front rank.<br> He stood nearly six and a half feet tall, a giant of a man, ebony<br> black, stepping along with the lithe grace of a powerful animal,<br> his white teeth flashing as he led the gang in ‘Go Down, Moses.’<br> Surely there wasn't a negro on earth as tall and loud voiced as<br> this one except Big Sam, the foreman of Tara. But what was Big Sam<br> doing here, so far away from home, especially now that there was no<br> overseer on the plantation and he was Gerald's right-hand man?<br><br> As she half rose from her seat to look closer, the giant caught<br> sight of her and his black face split in a grin of delighted<br> recognition. He halted, dropped his shovel and started toward her,<br> calling to the negroes nearest him: ‘Gawdlmighty! It's Miss<br> Scarlett! You, 'Lige! 'Postle! Prophet! Dar's Miss Scarlett!’<br><br> There was confusion in the ranks. The crowd halted uncertainly,<br> grinning, and Big Sam, followed by three other large negroes, ran<br> across the road to the carriage, closely followed by the harried,<br> shouting officer.<br><br> ‘Get back in line, you fellows! Get back, I tell you or I'll--<br> Why it's Mrs. Hamilton. Good morning, Ma'm, and you, too, sir.<br> What are you up to inciting mutiny and insubordination? God knows,<br> I've had trouble enough with these boys this morning.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Captain Randall, don't scold them! They are our people. This<br> is Big Sam our foreman, and Elijah and Apostle and Prophet from<br> Tara. Of course, they had to speak to me. How are you, boys?’<br><br> She shook hands all around, her small white hand disappearing into<br> their huge black paws and the four capered with delight at the<br> meeting and with pride at displaying before their comrades what a<br> pretty Young Miss they had.<br><br> ‘What are you boys doing so far from Tara? You've run away, I'll<br> be bound. Don't you know the patterollers will get you sure?’<br><br> They bellowed pleasedly at the badinage.<br><br> ‘Runned away?’ answered Big Sam. ‘No'm, us ain' runned away. Dey<br> done sont an' tuck us, kase us wuz de fo' bigges' an' stronges'<br> han's at Tara.’ His white teeth showed proudly. ‘Dey specially<br> sont fer me, kase Ah could sing so good. Yas'm, Mist' Frank<br> Kennedy, he come by an' tuck us.’<br><br> ‘But why, Big Sam?’<br><br> ‘Lawd, Miss Scarlett! Ain' you heerd? Us is ter dig de ditches<br> fer de wite gempmums ter hide in w'en de Yankees comes.’<br><br> Captain Randall and the occupants of the carriage smothered smiles<br> at this naive explanation of rifle pits.<br><br> ‘Cose, Mis' Gerald might' nigh had a fit w'en dey tuck me, an' he<br> say he kain run de place widout me. But Miss Ellen she say: 'Tek<br> him, Mist' Kennedy. De Confedrutsy need Big Sam mo' dan us do.'<br> An' she gib me a dollar an' tell me ter do jes' whut de w'ite<br> gempmums tell me. So hyah us is.’<br><br> ‘What does it all mean, Captain Randall?’<br><br> ‘Oh, it's quite simple. We have to strengthen the fortifications<br> of Atlanta with more miles of rifle pits, and the General can't<br> spare any men from the front to do it. So we've been impressing<br> the strongest bucks in the countryside for the work.’<br><br> ‘But--’<br><br> A cold little fear was beginning to throb in Scarlett's breast.<br> More miles of rifle pits! Why should they need more? Within the<br> last year, a series of huge earth redoubts with battery<br> emplacements had been built all around Atlanta, one mile from the<br> center of town. These great earth-works were connected with rifle<br> pits and they ran, mile after mile, completely encircling the city.<br> More rifle pits!<br><br> ‘But--why should we be fortified any more than we are already<br> fortified? We won't need what we've got. Surely, the General<br> won't let--’<br><br> ‘Our present fortifications are only a mile from town,’ said<br> Captain Randall shortly. ‘And that's too close for comfort--or<br> safety. These new ones are going to be farther away. You see,<br> another retreat may bring our men into Atlanta.’<br><br> Immediately he regretted his last remark, as her eyes widened with<br> fear.<br><br> ‘But, of course there won't be another retreat,’ he added hastily.<br> ‘The lines around Kennesaw Mountain are impregnable. The batteries<br> are planted all up the mountain sides and they command the roads,<br> and the Yankees can't possibly get by.’<br><br> But Scarlett saw him drop his eyes before the lazy, penetrating<br> look Rhett gave him, and she was frightened. She remembered<br> Rhett's remark: ‘When the Yankees push him out of the mountains<br> and onto the flatter land, he'll be butchered.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Captain, do you think--’<br><br> ‘Why, of course not! Don't fret your mind one minute. Old Joe<br> just believes in taking precautions. That's the only reason we're<br> digging more entrenchments. . . . But I must be going now. It's<br> been pleasant, talking to you. . . . Say good-by to your mistress,<br> boys, and let's get going.’<br><br> ‘Good-by, boys. Now, if you get sick or hurt or in trouble, let me<br> know. I live right down Peachtree Street, down there in almost the<br> last house at the end of town. Wait a minute--’ She fumbled in<br> her reticule. ‘Oh, dear, I haven't a cent. Rhett, give me a few<br> shinplasters. Here, Big Sam, buy some tobacco for yourself and the<br> boys. And be good and do what Captain Randall tells you.’<br><br> The straggling line re-formed, the dust arose again in a red cloud<br> as they moved off and Big Sam started up the singing again.<br><br> <br> ‘Go do-ow, Mos-es! Waaa-ay, do-own, in Eeejup laa-an!<br> An' te-el O-le Faa-ro-o<br> Ter let mah--peee-pul go!’<br><br> <br> ‘Rhett, Captain Randall was lying to me, just like all the men do--<br> trying to keep the truth from us women for fear we'll faint. Or<br> was he lying? Oh, Rhett, if there's no danger, why are they<br> digging these new breastworks? Is the army so short of men they've<br> got to use darkies?’<br><br> Rhett clucked to the mare.<br><br> ‘The army is damned short of men. Why else would the Home Guard be<br> called out? And as for the entrenchments, well, fortifications are<br> supposed to be of some value in case of a siege. The General is<br> preparing to make his final stand here.’<br><br> ‘A siege! Oh, turn the horse around. I'm going home, back home to<br> Tara, right away.’<br><br> ‘What ails you?’<br><br> ‘A siege! Name of God, a siege! I've heard about sieges! Pa was<br> in one or maybe it was his Pa, and Pa told me--’<br><br> ‘What siege?’<br><br> ‘The siege at Drogheda when Cromwell had the Irish, and they didn't<br> have anything to eat and Pa said they starved and died in the<br> streets and finally they ate all the cats and rats and even things<br> like cockroaches. And he said they ate each other too, before they<br> surrendered, though I never did know whether to believe that or<br> not. And when Cromwell took the town all the women were-- A<br> siege! Mother of God!’<br><br> ‘You are the most barbarously ignorant young person I ever saw.<br> Drogheda was in sixteen hundred and something and Mr. O'Hara<br> couldn't possibly have been alive then. Besides, Sherman isn't<br> Cromwell.’<br><br> ‘No, but he's worse! They say--’<br><br> ‘And as for the exotic viands the Irish ate at the siege--<br> personally I'd as soon eat a nice juicy rat as some of the victuals<br> they've been serving me recently at the hotel. I think I shall<br> have to go back to Richmond. They have good food there, if you<br> have the money to pay for it.’ His eyes mocked the fear in her<br> face.<br><br> Annoyed that she had shown her trepidation, she cried: ‘I don't<br> see why you've stayed here this long! All you think about is being<br> comfortable and eating and--and things like that.’<br><br> ‘I know no more pleasant way to pass the time than in eating and<br> er--things like that,’ he said. ‘And as for why I stay here--well,<br> I've read a good deal about sieges, beleaguered cities and the<br> like, but I've never seen one. So I think I'll stay here and<br> watch. I won't get hurt because I'm a noncombatant and besides I<br> want the experience. Never pass up new experiences, Scarlett.<br> They enrich the mind.’<br><br> ‘My mind's rich enough.’<br><br> ‘Perhaps you know best about that, but I should say-- But that<br> would be ungallant. And perhaps, I'm staying here to rescue you<br> when the siege does come. I've never rescued a maiden in distress.<br> That would be a new experience, too.’<br><br> She knew he was teasing her but she sensed a seriousness behind his<br> words. She tossed her head.<br><br> ‘I won't need you to rescue me. I can take care of myself, thank<br> you.’<br><br> ‘Don't say that, Scarlett! Think of it, if you like, but never,<br> never say it to a man. That's the trouble with Yankee girls.<br> They'd be most charming if they weren't always telling you that<br> they can take care of themselves, thank you. Generally they are<br> telling the truth, God help them. And so men let them take care of<br> themselves.’<br><br> ‘How you do run on,’ she said coldly, for there was no insult worse<br> than being likened to a Yankee girl. ‘I believe you're lying about<br> a siege. You know the Yankees will never get to Atlanta.’<br><br> ‘I'll bet you they will be here within the month. I'll bet you a<br> box of bonbons against--’ His dark eyes wandered to her lips.<br> ‘Against a kiss.’<br><br> For a last brief moment, fear of a Yankee invasion clutched her<br> heart but at the word ‘kiss,’ she forgot about it. This was<br> familiar ground and far more interesting than military operations.<br> With difficulty she restrained a smile of glee. Since the day when<br> he gave her the green bonnet, Rhett had made no advances which<br> could in any way be construed as those of a lover. He could never<br> be inveigled into personal conversations, try though she might, but<br> now with no angling on her part, he was talking about kissing.<br><br> ‘I don't care for such personal conversation,’ she said coolly and<br> managed a frown. ‘Besides, I'd just as soon kiss a pig.’<br><br> ‘There's no accounting for tastes and I've always heard the Irish<br> were partial to pigs--kept them under their beds, in fact. But,<br> Scarlett, you need kissing badly. That's what's wrong with you.<br> All your beaux have respected you too much, though God knows why,<br> or they have been too afraid of you to really do right by you. The<br> result is that you are unendurably uppity. You should be kissed<br> and by someone who knows how.’<br><br> The conversation was not going the way she wanted it. It never did<br> when she was with him. Always, it was a duel in which she was<br> worsted.<br><br> ‘And I suppose you think you are the proper person?’ she asked with<br> sarcasm, holding her temper in check with difficulty.<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, if I cared to take the trouble,’ he said carelessly.<br> ‘They say I kiss very well.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she began, indignant at the slight to her charms. ‘Why,<br> you . . .’ But her eyes fell in sudden confusion. He was smiling,<br> but in the dark depths of his eyes a tiny light flickered for a<br> brief moment, like a small raw flame.<br><br> ‘Of course, you've probably wondered why I never tried to follow up<br> that chaste peck I gave you, the day I brought you that bonnet--’<br><br> ‘I have never--’<br><br> ‘Then you aren't a nice girl, Scarlett, and I'm sorry to hear it.<br> All really nice girls wonder when men don't try to kiss them. They<br> know they shouldn't want them to and they know they must act<br> insulted if they do, but just the same, they wish the men would<br> try. . . . Well, my dear, take heart. Some day, I will kiss you<br> and you will like it. But not now, so I beg you not to be too<br> impatient.’<br><br> She knew he was teasing but, as always, his teasing maddened her.<br> There was always too much truth in the things he said. Well, this<br> finished him. If ever, ever he should be so ill bred as to try to<br> take any liberties with her, she would show him.<br><br> ‘Will you kindly turn the horse around, Captain Butler? I wish to<br> go back to the hospital.’<br><br> ‘Do you indeed, my ministering angel? Then lice and slops are<br> preferable to my conversation? Well, far be it from me to keep a<br> pair of willing hands from laboring for Our Glorious Cause.’ He<br> turned the horse's head and they started back toward Five Points.<br><br> ‘As to why I have made no further advances,’ he pursued blandly, as<br> though she had not signified that the conversation was at an end,<br> ‘I'm waiting for you to grow up a little more. You see, it<br> wouldn't be much fun for me to kiss you now and I'm quite selfish<br> about my pleasures. I never fancied kissing children.’<br><br> He smothered a grin, as from the corner of his eye he saw her bosom<br> heave with silent wrath.<br><br> ‘And then, too,’ he continued softly, ‘I was waiting for the memory<br> of the estimable Ashley Wilkes to fade.’<br><br> At the mention of Ashley's name, sudden pain went through her,<br> sudden hot tears stung her lids. Fade? The memory of Ashley would<br> never fade, not if he were dead a thousand years. She thought of<br> Ashley wounded, dying in a far-off Yankee prison, with no blankets<br> over him, with no one who loved him to hold his hand, and she was<br> filled with hate for the well-fed man who sat beside her, jeers<br> just beneath the surface of his drawling voice.<br><br> She was too angry to speak and they rode along in silence for some<br> while.<br><br> ‘I understand practically everything about you and Ashley, now,’<br> Rhett resumed. ‘I began with your inelegant scene at Twelve Oaks<br> and, since then, I've picked up many things by keeping my eyes<br> open. What things? Oh, that you still cherish a romantic<br> schoolgirl passion for him which he reciprocates as well as his<br> honorable nature will permit him. And that Mrs. Wilkes knows<br> nothing and that, between the two of you, you've done her a pretty<br> trick. I understand practically everything, except one thing that<br> piques my curiosity. Did the honorable Ashley ever jeopardize his<br> immortal soul by kissing you?’<br><br> A stony silence and an averted head were his answers.<br><br> ‘Ah, well, so he did kiss you. I suppose it was when he was here<br> on furlough. And now that he's probably dead you are cherishing it<br> to your heart. But I'm sure you'll get over it and when you've<br> forgotten his kiss, I'll--’<br><br> She turned in fury.<br><br> ‘You go to--Halifax,’ she said tensely, her green eyes slits of<br> rage. ‘And let me out of this carriage before I jump over the<br> wheels. And I don't ever want to speak to you again.’<br><br> He stopped the carriage, but before he could alight and assist her<br> she sprang down. Her hoop caught on the wheel and for a moment the<br> crowd at Five Points had a flashing view of petticoats and<br> pantalets. Then Rhett leaned over and swiftly released it. She<br> flounced off without a word, without even a backward look, and he<br> laughed softly and clicked to the horse.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XVIII<br><br> <br> For the first time since the war began, Atlanta could hear the<br> sound of battle. In the early morning hours before the noises of<br> the town awoke, the cannon at Kennesaw Mountain could be heard<br> faintly, far away, a low dim booming that might have passed for<br> summer thunder. Occasionally it was loud enough to be heard even<br> above the rattle of traffic at noon. People tried not to listen to<br> it, tried to talk, to laugh, to carry on their business, just as<br> though the Yankees were not there, twenty-two miles away, but<br> always ears were strained for the sound. The town wore a<br> preoccupied look, for no matter what occupied their hands, all were<br> listening, listening, their hearts leaping suddenly a hundred times<br> a day. Was the booming louder? Or did they only think it was<br> louder? Would General Johnston hold them this time? Would he?<br><br> Panic lay just beneath the surface. Nerves which had been<br> stretched tighter and tighter each day of the retreat began to<br> reach the breaking point. No one spoke of fears. That subject was<br> taboo, but strained nerves found expression in loud criticism of<br> the General. Public feeling was at fever heat. Sherman was at the<br> very doors of Atlanta. Another retreat might bring the<br> Confederates into the town.<br><br> Give us a general who won't retreat! Give us a man who will stand<br> and fight!<br><br> With the far-off rumbling of cannon in their ears, the state<br> militia, ‘Joe Brown's Pets,’ and the Home Guard marched out of<br> Atlanta, to defend the bridges and ferries of the Chattahoochee<br> River at Johnston's back. It was a gray, overcast day and, as they<br> marched through Five Points and out the Marietta road, a fine rain<br> began to fall. The whole town had turned out to see them off and<br> they stood, close packed, under the wooden awnings of the stores on<br> Peachtree Street and tried to cheer.<br><br> Scarlett and Maybelle Merriwether Picard had been given permission<br> to leave the hospital and watch the men go out, because Uncle Henry<br> Hamilton and Grandpa Merriwether were in the Home Guard, and they<br> stood with Mrs. Meade, pressed in the crowd, tiptoeing to get a<br> better view. Scarlett, though filled with the universal Southern<br> desire to believe only the pleasantest and most reassuring things<br> about the progress of the fighting, felt cold as she watched the<br> motley ranks go by. Surely, things must be in a desperate pass if<br> this rabble of bombproofers, old men and little boys were being<br> called out! To be sure there were young and able-bodied men in the<br> passing lines, tricked out in the bright uniforms of socially<br> select militia units, plumes waving, sashes dancing. But there<br> were so many old men and young boys, and the sight of them made her<br> heart contract with pity and with fear. There were graybeards<br> older than her father trying to step jauntily along in the needle-<br> fine rain to the rhythm of the fife and drum corps. Grandpa<br> Merriwether, with Mrs. Merriwether's best plaid shawl laid across<br> his shoulders to keep out the rain, was in the first rank and he<br> saluted the girls with a grin. They waved their handkerchiefs and<br> cried gay good-bys to him; but Maybelle, gripping Scarlett's arm,<br> whispered: ‘Oh, the poor old darling! A real good rainstorm will<br> just about finish him! His lumbago--’<br><br> Uncle Henry Hamilton marched in the rank behind Grandpa<br> Merriwether, the collar of his long black coat turned up about his<br> ears, two Mexican War pistols in his belt and a small carpetbag in<br> his hand. Beside him marched his black valet who was nearly as old<br> as Uncle Henry, with an open umbrella held over them both.<br> Shoulder to shoulder with their elders came the young boys, none of<br> them looking over sixteen. Many of them had run away from school<br> to join the army, and here and there were clumps of them in the<br> cadet uniforms of military academies, the black cock feathers on<br> their tight gray caps wet with rain, the clean white canvas straps<br> crossing their chests sodden. Phil Meade was among them, proudly<br> wearing his dead brother's saber and horse pistols, his hat bravely<br> pinned up on one side. Mrs. Meade managed to smile and wave until<br> he had passed and then she leaned her head on the back of<br> Scarlett's shoulder for a moment as though her strength had<br> suddenly left her.<br><br> Many of the men were totally unarmed, for the Confederacy had<br> neither rifles nor ammunition to issue to them. These men hoped to<br> equip themselves from killed and captured Yankees. Many carried<br> bowie knives in their boots and bore in their hands long thick<br> poles with iron-pointed tips known as ‘Joe Brown pikes.’ The lucky<br> ones had old flintlock muskets slung over their shoulders and<br> powder-horns at their belts.<br><br> Johnston had lost around ten thousand men in his retreat. He<br> needed ten thousand more fresh troops. And this, thought Scarlett<br> frightened, is what he is getting!<br><br> As the artillery rumbled by, splashing mud into the watching<br> crowds, a negro on a mule, riding close to a cannon caught her eye.<br> He was a young, saddle-colored negro with a serious face, and when<br> Scarlett saw him she cried: ‘It's Mose! Ashley's Mose! Whatever<br> is he doing here?’ She fought her way through the crowd to the<br> curb and called: ‘Mose! Stop!’<br><br> The boy seeing her, drew rein, smiled delightedly and started to<br> dismount. A soaking sergeant, riding behind him, called: ‘Stay on<br> that mule, boy, or I'll light a fire under you! We got to git to<br> the mountain some time.’<br><br> Uncertainly, Mose looked from the sergeant to Scarlett and she,<br> splashing through the mud, close to the passing wheels, caught at<br> Moses' stirrup strap.<br><br> ‘Oh, just a minute, Sergeant! Don't get down, Mose. What on earth<br> are you doing here?’<br><br> ‘Ah's off ter de war, agin, Miss Scarlett. Dis time wid Ole Mist'<br> John 'stead ob Mist' Ashley.’<br><br> ‘Mr. Wilkes!’ Scarlett was stunned. Mr. Wilkes was nearly seventy.<br> ‘Where is he?’<br><br> ‘Back wid de las' cannon, Miss Scarlett. Back dar!’<br><br> ‘Sorry, lady. Move on, boy!’<br><br> Scarlett stood for a moment, ankle deep in mud as the guns lurched<br> by. Oh, no! She thought. It can't be. He's too old. And he<br> doesn't like war any more than Ashley did! She retreated back a<br> few paces toward the curb and scanned each face that passed. Then,<br> as the last cannon and limber chest came groaning and splashing up,<br> she saw him, slender, erect, his long silver hair wet upon his<br> neck, riding easily upon a little strawberry mare that picked her<br> way as daintily through the mud holes as a lady in a satin dress.<br> Why--that mare was Nellie! Mrs. Tarleton's Nellie! Beatrice<br> Tarleton's treasured darling!<br><br> When he saw her standing in the mud, Mr. Wilkes drew rein with a<br> smile of pleasure and, dismounting, came toward her.<br><br> ‘I had hoped to see you, Scarlett. I was charged with so many<br> messages from your people. But there was no time. We just got in<br> this morning and they are rushing us out immediately, as you see.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Mr. Wilkes,’ she cried desperately, holding his hand. ‘Don't<br> go! Why must you go?’<br><br> ‘Ah, so you think I'm too old!’ he smiled, and it was Ashley's<br> smile in an older face. ‘Perhaps I am too old to march but not to<br> ride and shoot. And Mrs. Tarleton so kindly lent me Nellie, so I<br> am well mounted. I hope nothing happens to Nellie, for if<br> something should happen to her, I could never go home and face Mrs.<br> Tarleton. Nellie was the last horse she had left.’ He was<br> laughing now, turning away her fears. ‘Your mother and father and<br> the girls are well and they sent you their love. Your father<br> nearly came up with us today!’<br><br> ‘Oh, not Pa!’ cried Scarlett in terror. ‘Not Pa! He isn't going<br> to the war, is he?’<br><br> ‘No, but he was. Of course, he can't walk far with his stiff knee,<br> but he was all for riding away with us. Your mother agreed,<br> providing he was able to jump the pasture fence, for, she said,<br> there would be a lot of rough riding to be done in the army. Your<br> father thought that easy, but--would you believe it? When his<br> horse came to the fence, he stopped dead and over his head went<br> your father! It's a wonder it didn't break his neck! You know how<br> obstinate he is. He got right up and tried it again. Well,<br> Scarlett, he came off three times before Mrs. O'Hara and Pork<br> assisted him to bed. He was in a taking about it, swearing that<br> your mother had 'spoken a wee word in the beast's ear.' He just<br> isn't up to active service, Scarlett. You need have no shame about<br> it. After all, someone must stay home and raise crops for the<br> army.’<br><br> Scarlett had no shame at all, only an active feeling of relief.<br><br> ‘I've sent India and Honey to Macon to stay with the Burrs and Mr.<br> O'Hara is looking after Twelve Oaks as well as Tara. . . . I must<br> go, my dear. Let me kiss your pretty face.’<br><br> Scarlett turned up her lips and there was a choking pain in her<br> throat. She was so fond of Mr. Wilkes. Once, long ago, she had<br> hoped to be his daughter-in-law.<br><br> ‘And you must deliver this kiss to Pittypat and this to Melanie,’<br> he said, kissing her lightly two more times. ‘And how is Melanie?’<br><br> ‘She is well.’<br><br> ‘Ah!’ His eyes looked at her but through her, past her as Ashley's<br> had done, remote gray eyes looking on another world. ‘I should<br> have liked to see my first grandchild. Good-by, my dear.’<br><br> He swung onto Nellie and cantered off, his hat in his hand, his<br> silver hair bare to the rain. Scarlett had rejoined Maybelle and<br> Mrs. Meade before the import of his last words broke upon her.<br> Then in superstitious terror she crossed herself and tried to say a<br> prayer. He had spoken of death, just as Ashley had done, and now<br> Ashley-- No one should ever speak of death! It was tempting<br> Providence to mention death. As the three women started silently<br> back to the hospital in the rain, Scarlett was praying: ‘Not him,<br> too, God. Not him and Ashley, too!’<br><br> The retreat from Dalton to Kennesaw Mountain had taken from early<br> May to mid-June and as the hot rainy days of June passed and<br> Sherman failed to dislodge the Confederates from the steep slippery<br> slopes, hope again raised its head. Everyone grew more cheerful<br> and spoke more kindly of General Johnston. As wet June days passed<br> into a wetter July and the Confederates, fighting desperately<br> around the entrenched heights, still held Sherman at bay, a wild<br> gaiety took hold of Atlanta. Hope went to their heads like<br> champagne. Hurrah! Hurrah! We're holding them! An epidemic of<br> parties and dances broke out. Whenever groups of men from the<br> fighting were in town for the night, dinners were given for them<br> and afterwards there was dancing and the girls, outnumbering the<br> men ten to one, made much of them and fought to dance with them.<br><br> Atlanta was crowded with visitors, refugees, families of wounded<br> men in the hospitals, wives and mothers of soldiers fighting at the<br> mountain who wished to be near them in case of wounds. In<br> addition, bevies of belles from the country districts, where all<br> remaining men were under sixteen or over sixty, descended upon the<br> town. Aunt Pitty disapproved highly of these last, for she felt<br> they had come to Atlanta for no reason at all except to catch<br> husbands, and the shamelessness of it made her wonder what the<br> world was coming to. Scarlett disapproved, too. She did not care<br> for the eager competition furnished by the sixteen-year-olds whose<br> fresh cheeks and bright smiles made one forget their twice-turned<br> frocks and patched shoes. Her own clothes were prettier and newer<br> than most, thanks to the material Rhett Butler had brought her on<br> the last boat he ran in, but, after all, she was nineteen and<br> getting along and men had a way of chasing silly young things.<br><br> A widow with a child was at a disadvantage with these pretty<br> minxes, she thought. But in these exciting days her widowhood and<br> her motherhood weighed less heavily upon her than ever before.<br> Between hospital duties in the day time and parties at night, she<br> hardly ever saw Wade. Sometimes she actually forgot, for long<br> stretches, that she had a child.<br><br> In the warm wet summer nights, Atlanta's homes stood open to the<br> soldiers, the town's defenders. The big houses from Washington<br> Street to Peachtree Street blazed with lights, as the muddy<br> fighters in from the rifle pits were entertained, and the sound of<br> banjo and fiddle and the scrape of dancing feet and light laughter<br> carried far on the night air. Groups hung over pianos and voices<br> sang lustily the sad words of ‘Your Letter Came but Came Too Late’<br> while ragged gallants looked meaningly at girls who laughed from<br> behind turkey-tail fans, begging them not to wait until it was too<br> late. None of the girls waited, if they could help it. With the<br> tide of hysterical gaiety and excitement flooding the city, they<br> rushed into matrimony. There were so many marriages that month<br> while Johnston was holding the enemy at Kennesaw Mountain,<br> marriages with the bride turned out in blushing happiness and the<br> hastily borrowed finery of a dozen friends and the groom with saber<br> banging at patched knees. So much excitement, so many parties, so<br> many thrills! Hurrah! Johnston is holding the Yanks twenty-two<br> miles away!<br><br> <br><br> Yes, the lines around Kennesaw Mountain were impregnable. After<br> twenty-five days of fighting, even General Sherman was convinced of<br> this, for his losses were enormous. Instead of continuing the<br> direct assault, he swung his army in a wide circle again and tried<br> to come between the Confederates and Atlanta. Again, the strategy<br> worked. Johnston was forced to abandon the heights he had held so<br> well, in order to protect his rear. He had lost a third of his men<br> in that fight and the remainder slogged tiredly through the rain<br> across the country toward the Chattahoochee River. The<br> Confederates could expect no more reinforcements, whereas the<br> railroad, which the Yankees now held from Tennessee south to the<br> battle line, brought Sherman fresh troops and supplies daily. So<br> the gray lines went back through the muddy fields, back toward<br> Atlanta.<br><br> With the loss of the supposedly unconquerable position, a fresh<br> wave of terror swept the town. For twenty-five wild, happy days,<br> everyone had assured everyone else that this could not possibly<br> happen. And now it had happened! But surely the General would<br> hold the Yankees on the opposite bank of the river. Though God<br> knows the river was close enough, only seven miles away!<br><br> But Sherman flanked them again, crossing the stream above them, and<br> the weary gray files were forced to hurry across the yellow water<br> and throw themselves again between the invaders and Atlanta. They<br> dug in hastily in shallow pits to the north of the town in the<br> valley of Peachtree Creek. Atlanta was in agony and panic.<br><br> Fight and fall back! Fight and fall back! And every retreat was<br> bringing the Yankees closer to the town. Peachtree Creek was only<br> five miles away! What was the General thinking about?<br><br> The cries of ‘Give us a man who will stand and fight!’ penetrated<br> even to Richmond. Richmond knew that if Atlanta was lost, the war<br> was lost, and after the army had crossed the Chattahoochee, General<br> Johnston was removed from command. General Hood, one of his corps<br> commanders, took over the army, and the town breathed a little<br> easier. Hood wouldn't retreat. Not that tall Kentuckian, with his<br> flowing beard and flashing eye! He had the reputation of a<br> bulldog. He'd drive the Yankees back from the creek, yes, back<br> across the river and on up the road every step of the way back to<br> Dalton. But the army cried: ‘Give us back Old Joe!’ for they had<br> been with Old Joe all the weary miles from Dalton and they knew, as<br> the civilians could not know, the odds that had opposed them.<br><br> Sherman did not wait for Hood to get himself in readiness to<br> attack. On the day after the change in command, the Yankee general<br> struck swiftly at the little town of Decatur, six miles beyond<br> Atlanta, captured it and cut the railroad there. This was the<br> railroad connecting Atlanta with Augusta, with Charleston, and<br> Wilmington and with Virginia. Sherman had dealt the Confederacy a<br> crippling blow. The time had come for action! Atlanta screamed<br> for action!<br><br> Then, on a July afternoon of steaming heat, Atlanta had its wish.<br> General Hood did more than stand and fight. He assaulted the<br> Yankees fiercely at Peachtree Creek, hurling his men from their<br> rifle pits against the blue lines where Sherman's men outnumbered<br> him more than two to one.<br><br> Frightened, praying that Hood's attack would drive the Yankees<br> back, everyone listened to the sound of booming cannon and the<br> crackling of thousands of rifles which, though five miles away from<br> the center of town, were so loud as to seem almost in the next<br> block. They could hear the rumblings of the batteries, see the<br> smoke which rolled like low-hanging clouds above the trees, but for<br> hours no one knew how the battle was going.<br><br> By late afternoon the first news came, but it was uncertain,<br> contradictory, frightening, brought as it was by men wounded in the<br> early hours of the battle. These men began straggling in, singly<br> and in groups, the less seriously wounded supporting those who<br> limped and staggered. Soon a steady stream of them was<br> established, making their painful way into town toward the<br> hospitals, their faces black as negroes' from powder stains, dust<br> and sweat, their wounds unbandaged, blood drying, flies swarming<br> about them.<br><br> Aunt Pitty's was one of the first houses which the wounded reached<br> as they struggled in from the north of the town, and one after<br> another, they tottered to the gate, sank down on the green lawn and<br> croaked:<br><br> ‘Water!’<br><br> All that burning afternoon, Aunt Pitty and her family, black and<br> white, stood in the sun with buckets of water and bandages, ladling<br> drinks, binding wounds until the bandages gave out and even the<br> torn sheets and towels were exhausted. Aunt Pitty completely<br> forgot that the sight of blood always made her faint and she worked<br> until her little feet in their too small shoes swelled and would no<br> longer support her. Even Melanie, now great with child, forgot her<br> modesty and worked feverishly side by side with Prissy, Cookie and<br> Scarlett, her face as tense as any of the wounded. When at last<br> she fainted, there was no place to lay her except on the kitchen<br> table, as every bed, chair and sofa in the house was filled with<br> wounded.<br><br> Forgotten in the tumult, little Wade crouched behind the banisters<br> on the front porch, peering out onto the lawn like a caged,<br> frightened rabbit, his eyes wide with terror, sucking his thumb and<br> hiccoughing. Once Scarlett saw him and cried sharply: ‘Go play in<br> the back yard, Wade Hampton!’ but he was too terrified, too<br> fascinated by the mad scene before him to obey.<br><br> The lawn was covered with prostrate men, too tired to walk farther,<br> too weak from wounds to move. These Uncle Peter loaded into the<br> carriage and drove to the hospital, making trip after trip until<br> the old horse was lathered. Mrs. Meade and Mrs. Merriwether sent<br> their carriages and they, too, drove off, springs sagging beneath<br> the weight of the wounded.<br><br> Later, in the long, hot summer twilight, the ambulances came<br> rumbling down the road from the battle field and commissary wagons,<br> covered with muddy canvas. Then farm wagons, ox carts and even<br> private carriages commandeered by the medical corps. They passed<br> Aunt Pitty's house, jolting over the bumpy road, packed with<br> wounded and dying men, dripping blood into the red dust. At the<br> sight of the women with buckets and dippers, the conveyances halted<br> and the chorus went up in cries, in whispers:<br><br> ‘Water!’<br><br> Scarlett held wobbling heads that parched lips might drink, poured<br> buckets of water over dusty, feverish bodies and into open wounds<br> that the men might enjoy a brief moment's relief. She tiptoed to<br> hand dippers to ambulance drivers and of each she questioned, her<br> heart in her throat: ‘What news? What news?’<br><br> From all came back the answer: ‘Don't know fer sartin, lady. It's<br> too soon to tell.’<br><br> Night came and it was sultry. No air moved and the flaring pine<br> knots the negroes held made the air hotter. Dust clogged<br> Scarlett's nostrils and dried her lips. Her lavender calico dress,<br> so freshly clean and starched that morning, was streaked with<br> blood, dirt and sweat. This, then, was what Ashley had meant when<br> he wrote that war was not glory but dirt and misery.<br><br> Fatigue gave an unreal, nightmarish cast to the whole scene. It<br> couldn't be real--or it was real, then the world had gone mad. If<br> not, why should she be standing here in Aunt Pitty's peaceful front<br> yard, amid wavering lights, pouring water over dying beaux? For so<br> many of them were her beaux and they tried to smile when they saw<br> her. There were so many men jolting down this dark, dusty road<br> whom she knew so well, so many men dying here before her eyes,<br> mosquitoes and gnats swarming their bloody faces, men with whom she<br> had danced and laughed, for whom she had played music and sung<br> songs, teased, comforted and loved--a little.<br><br> She found Carey Ashburn on the bottom layer of wounded in an ox<br> cart, barely alive from a bullet wound in his head. But she could<br> not extricate him without disturbing six other wounded men, so she<br> let him go on to the hospital. Later she heard he had died before<br> a doctor ever saw him and was buried somewhere, no one knew<br> exactly. So many men had been buried that month, in shallow,<br> hastily dug graves at Oakland Cemetery. Melanie felt it keenly<br> that they had not been able to get a lock of Carey's hair to send<br> to his mother in Alabama.<br><br> As the hot night wore on and their backs were aching and their<br> knees buckling from weariness, Scarlett and Pitty cried to man<br> after man: ‘What news? What news?’<br><br> And as the long hours dragged past, they had their answer, an<br> answer that made them look whitely into each other's eyes.<br><br> ‘We're falling back.’ ‘We've got to fall back.’ ‘They outnumber<br> us by thousands.’ ‘The Yankees have got Wheeler's cavalry cut off<br> near Decatur. We got to reenforce them.’ ‘Our boys will all be in<br> town soon.’<br><br> Scarlett and Pitty clutched each other's arms for support.<br><br> ‘Are--are the Yankees coming?’<br><br> ‘Yes'm, they're comin' all right but they ain't goin' ter git fer,<br> lady.’ ‘Don't fret, Miss, they can't take Atlanta.’ ‘No, Ma'm, we<br> got a million miles of breastworks 'round this town.’ ‘I heard Old<br> Joe say it myself: 'I can hold Atlanta forever.'‘ ‘But we ain't<br> got Old Joe. We got--’ ‘Shut up, you fool! Do you want to scare<br> the ladies?’ ‘The Yankees will never take this place, Ma'm.’<br> ‘Whyn't you ladies go ter Macon or somewheres that's safer? Ain't<br> you got no kinfolks there?’ ‘The Yankees ain't goin' ter take<br> Atlanta but still it ain't goin' ter be so healthy for ladies<br> whilst they're tryin' it.’ ‘There's goin' ter be a powerful lot of<br> shellin'.’<br><br> In a warm steaming rain the next day, the defeated army poured<br> though Atlanta by thousands, exhausted by hunger and weariness,<br> depleted by seventy-six days of battle and retreat, their horses<br> starved scarecrows, their cannon and caissons harnessed with odds<br> and ends of rope and strips of rawhide. But they did not come in<br> as disorderly rabble, in full rout. They marched in good order,<br> jaunty for all their rags, their torn red battle flags flying in<br> the rain. They had learned retreating under Old Joe, who had made<br> it as great a feat of strategy as advancing. The bearded, shabby<br> files swung down Peachtree Street to the tune of ‘Maryland! My<br> Maryland!’ and all the town turned out to cheer them. In victory<br> or defeat, they were their boys.<br><br> The state militia who had gone out so short a time before,<br> resplendent in new uniforms, could hardly be distinguished from the<br> seasoned troops, so dirty and unkempt were they. There was a new<br> look in their eyes. Three years of apologizing, of explaining why<br> they were not at the front was behind them now. They had traded<br> security behind the lines for the hardships of battle. Many of<br> their number had traded easy living for hard death. They were<br> veterans now, veterans of brief service, but veterans just the<br> same, and they had acquitted themselves well. They searched out<br> the faces of friends in the crowd and stared at them proudly,<br> defiantly. They could hold up their heads now.<br><br> The old men and boys of the Home Guard marched by, the graybeards<br> almost too weary to lift their feet, the boys wearing the faces of<br> tired children, confronted too early with adult problems. Scarlett<br> caught sight of Phil Meade and hardly recognized him, so black was<br> his face with powder and grime, so taut with strain and weariness.<br> Uncle Henry went limping by, hatless in the rain, his head stuck<br> through a hole in a piece of old oilcloth. Grandpa Merriwether<br> rode in on a gun carriage, his bare feet tied in quilt scraps. But<br> search though she might, she saw no sign of John Wilkes.<br><br> Johnston's veterans, however, went by with the tireless, careless<br> step which had carried them for three years, and they still had the<br> energy to grin and wave at pretty girls and to call rude gibes to<br> men not in uniform. They were on their way to the entrenchments<br> that ringed the town--no shallow, hastily dug trenches, these, but<br> earthworks, breast high, reinforced with sandbags and tipped with<br> sharpened staves of wood. For mile after mile the trenches<br> encircled the town, red gashes surmounted by red mounds, waiting<br> for the men who would fill them.<br><br> The crowd cheered the troops as they would have cheered them in<br> victory. There was fear in every heart but, now that they knew the<br> truth, now that the worst had happened, now that the war was in<br> their front yard, a change came over the town. There was no panic<br> now, no hysteria. Whatever lay in hearts did not show on faces.<br> Everyone looked cheerful even if the cheer was strained. Everyone<br> tried to show brave, confident faces to the troops. Everyone<br> repeated what Old Joe had said, just before he was relieved of<br> command: ‘I can hold Atlanta forever.’<br><br> Now that Hood had had to retreat, quite a number wished, with the<br> soldiers, that they had Old Joe back, but they forebore saying it<br> and took courage from Old Joe's remark:<br><br> ‘I can hold Atlanta forever!’<br><br> <br><br> Not for Hood the cautious tactics of General Johnston. He<br> assaulted the Yankees on the east, he assaulted them on the west.<br> Sherman was circling the town like a wrestler seeking a fresh hold<br> on an opponent's body, and Hood did not remain behind his rifle<br> pits waiting for the Yankees to attack. He went out boldly to meet<br> them and savagely fell upon them. Within the space of a few days<br> the battles of Atlanta and of Ezra Church were fought, and both of<br> them were major engagements which made Peachtree Creek seem like a<br> skirmish.<br><br> But the Yankees kept coming back for more. They had suffered heavy<br> losses but they could afford to lose. And all the while their<br> batteries poured shells into Atlanta, killing people in their<br> homes, ripping roofs off buildings, tearing huge craters in the<br> streets. The townsfolk sheltered as best they could in cellars, in<br> holes in the ground and in shallow tunnels dug in railroad cuts.<br> Atlanta was under siege.<br><br> Within eleven days after he had taken command, General Hood had<br> lost almost as many men as Johnston had lost in seventy-four days<br> of battle and retreat, and Atlanta was hemmed in on three sides.<br><br> The railroad from Atlanta to Tennessee was now in Sherman's hands<br> for its full length. His army was across the railroad to the east<br> and he had cut the railroad running southwest to Alabama. Only the<br> one railroad to the south, to Macon and Savannah, was still open.<br> The town was crowded with soldiers, swamped with wounded, jammed<br> with refugees, and this one line was inadequate for the crying<br> needs of the stricken city. But as long as this railroad could be<br> held, Atlanta could still stand.<br><br> Scarlett was terrified when she realized how important this line<br> had become, how fiercely Sherman would fight to take it, how<br> desperately Hood would fight to defend it. For this was the<br> railroad which ran through the County, through Jonesboro. And Tara<br> was only five miles from Jonesboro! Tara seemed like a haven of<br> refuge by comparison with the screaming hell of Atlanta, but Tara<br> was only five miles from Jonesboro!<br><br> <br><br> Scarlett and many other ladies sat on the flat roofs of stores,<br> shaded by their tiny parasols, and watched the fighting on the day<br> of the battle of Atlanta. But when shells began falling in the<br> streets for the first time, they fled to the cellars, and that<br> night the exodus of women, children and old people from the city<br> began. Macon was their destination and many of those who took the<br> train that night had already refugeed five and six times before, as<br> Johnston fell back from Dalton. They were traveling lighter now<br> than when they arrived in Atlanta. Most of them carried only a<br> carpetbag and a scanty lunch done up in a bandana handkerchief.<br> Here and there, frightened servants carried silver pitchers, knives<br> and forks and a family portrait or two which had been salvaged in<br> the first fight.<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether and Mrs. Elsing refused to leave. They were<br> needed at the hospital and furthermore, they said proudly, they<br> weren't afraid and no Yankees were going to run them out of their<br> homes. But Maybelle and her baby and Fanny Elsing went to Macon.<br> Mrs. Meade was disobedient for the first time in her married life<br> and flatly refused to yield to the doctor's command that she take<br> the train to safety. The doctor needed her, she said. Moreover,<br> Phil was somewhere in the trenches and she wanted to be near by in<br> case . . .<br><br> But Mrs. Whiting went and many other ladies of Scarlett's circle.<br> Aunt Pitty, who had been the first to denounce Old Joe for his<br> policy of retreat, was among the first to pack her trunks. Her<br> nerves, she said, were delicate and she could not endure noises.<br> She feared she might faint at an explosion and not be able to reach<br> the cellar. No, she was not afraid. Her baby mouth tried to set<br> in martial lines but failed. She'd go to Macon and stay with her<br> cousin, old Mrs. Burr, and the girls should come with her.<br><br> Scarlett did not want to go to Macon. Frightened as she was of the<br> shells, she'd rather stay in Atlanta than go to Macon, for she<br> hated old Mrs. Burr cordially. Years ago, Mrs. Burr had said she<br> was ‘fast’ after catching her kissing her son Willie at one of the<br> Wilkes' house parties. No, she told Aunt Pitty, I'll go home to<br> Tara and Melly can go to Macon with you.<br><br> At this Melanie began to cry in a frightened, heartbroken way.<br> When Aunt Pitty fled to get Dr. Meade, Melanie caught Scarlett's<br> hand in hers, pleading:<br><br> ‘Dear, don't go to Tara and leave me! I'll be so lonely without<br> you. Oh, Scarlett, I'd just die if you weren't with me when the<br> baby came! Yes--Yes, I know I've got Aunt Pitty and she is sweet.<br> But after all, she's never had a baby, and sometimes she makes me<br> so nervous I could scream. Don't desert me, darling. You've been<br> just like a sister to me, and besides,’ she smiled wanly, ‘you<br> promised Ashley you'd take care of me. He told me he was going to<br> ask you.’<br><br> Scarlett stared down at her in wonderment. With her own dislike of<br> this woman so strong she could barely conceal it, how could Melly<br> love her so? How could Melly be so stupid as not to guess the<br> secret of her love of Ashley? She had given herself away a hundred<br> times during these months of torment, waiting for news of him. But<br> Melanie saw nothing, Melanie who could see nothing but good in<br> anyone she loved. . . . Yes, she had promised Ashley she would<br> look out for Melanie. Oh, Ashley! Ashley! you must be dead, dead<br> these many months! And now your promise reaches out and clutches<br> me!<br><br> ‘Well,’ she said shortly, ‘I did promise him that and I don't go<br> back on my promises. But I won't go to Macon and stay with that<br> old Burr cat. I'd claw her eyes out in five minutes. I'm going<br> home to Tara and you can come with me. Mother would love to have<br> you.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I'd like that! Your mother is so sweet. But you know Auntie<br> would just die if she wasn't with me when the baby came, and I know<br> she won't go to Tara. It's too close to the fighting, and Auntie<br> wants to be safe.’<br><br> Dr. Meade, who had arrived out of breath, expecting to find Melanie<br> in premature labor at least, judging by Aunt Pitty's alarmed<br> summoning, was indignant and said as much. And upon learning the<br> cause of the upset, he settled the matter with words that left no<br> room for argument.<br><br> ‘It's out of the question for you to go to Macon, Miss Melly. I<br> won't answer for you if you move. The trains are crowded and<br> uncertain and the passengers are liable to be put off in the woods<br> at any time, if the trains are needed for the wounded or troops and<br> supplies. In your condition--’<br><br> ‘But if I went to Tara with Scarlett--’<br><br> ‘I tell you I won't have you moved. The train to Tara is the train<br> to Macon and the same conditions prevail. Moreover, no one knows<br> just where the Yankees are now, but they are all over everywhere.<br> Your train might even be captured. And even if you reached<br> Jonesboro safely, there'd be a five-mile ride over a rough road<br> before you ever reached Tara. It's no trip for a woman in a<br> delicate condition. Besides, there's not a doctor in the County<br> since old Dr. Fontaine joined the army.’<br><br> ‘But there are midwives--’<br><br> ‘I said a doctor,’ he answered brusquely and his eyes unconsciously<br> went over her tiny frame. ‘I won't have you moved. It might be<br> dangerous. You don't want to have the baby on the train or in a<br> buggy, do you?’<br><br> This medical frankness reduced the ladies to embarrassed blushes<br> and silence.<br><br> ‘You've got to stay right here where I can watch you, and you must<br> stay in bed. No running up and down stairs to cellars. No, not<br> even if shells come right in the window. After all, there's not<br> so much danger here. We'll have the Yankees beaten back in no<br> time. . . . Now, Miss Pitty, you go right on to Macon and leave<br> the young ladies here.’<br><br> ‘Unchaperoned?’ she cried, aghast.<br><br> ‘They are matrons,’ said the doctor testily. ‘And Mrs. Meade is<br> just two houses away. They won't be receiving any male company<br> anyway with Miss Melly in her condition. Good Heavens, Miss Pitty!<br> This is war time. We can't think of the proprieties now. We must<br> think of Miss Melly.’<br><br> He stamped out of the room and waited on the front porch until<br> Scarlett joined him.<br><br> ‘I shall talk frankly to you, Miss Scarlett,’ he began, jerking at<br> his gray beard. ‘You seem to be a young woman of common sense, so<br> spare me your blushes. I do not want to hear any further talk<br> about Miss Melly being moved. I doubt if she could stand the trip.<br> She is going to have a difficult time, even in the best of<br> circumstances--very narrow in the hips, as you know, and probably<br> will need forceps for her delivery, so I don't want any ignorant<br> darky midwife meddling with her. Women like her should never have<br> children, but-- Anyway, you pack Miss Pitty's trunk and send her<br> to Macon. She's so scared she'll upset Miss Melly and that won't<br> do any good. And now, Miss,’ he fixed her with a piercing glance,<br> ‘I don't want to hear about you going home, either. You stay with<br> Miss Melly till the baby comes. Not afraid, are you?’<br><br> ‘Oh, no!’ lied Scarlett, stoutly.<br><br> ‘That's a brave girl. Mrs. Meade will give you whatever<br> chaperonage you need and I'll send over old Betsy to cook for you,<br> if Miss Pitty wants to take her servants with her. It won't be for<br> long. The baby ought to be here in another five weeks, but you<br> never can tell with first babies and all this shelling going on.<br> It may come any day.’<br><br> So Aunt Pittypat went to Macon, in floods of tears, taking Uncle<br> Peter and Cookie with her. The carriage and horse she donated to<br> the hospital in a burst of patriotism which she immediately<br> regretted and that brought on more tears. And Scarlett and Melanie<br> were left alone with Wade and Prissy in a house that was much<br> quieter, even though the cannonading continued.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XIX<br><br> <br> In those first days of the siege, when the Yankees crashed here and<br> there against the defenses of the city, Scarlett was so frightened<br> by the bursting shells she could only cower helplessly, her hands<br> over her ears, expecting every moment to be blown into eternity.<br> When she heard the whistling screams that heralded their approach,<br> she rushed to Melanie's room and flung herself on the bed beside<br> her, and the two clutched each other, screaming ‘Oh! Oh!’ as they<br> buried their heads in the pillows. Prissy and Wade scurried for<br> the cellar and crouched in the cobwebbed darkness, Prissy squalling<br> at the top of her voice and Wade sobbing and hiccoughing.<br><br> Suffocating under feather pillows while death screamed overhead,<br> Scarlett silently cursed Melanie for keeping her from the safer<br> regions below stairs. But the doctor had forbidden Melanie to walk<br> and Scarlett had to stay with her. Added to her terror of being<br> blown to pieces was her equally active terror that Melanie's baby<br> might arrive at any moment. Sweat broke out on Scarlett with<br> clammy dampness, whenever this thought entered her mind. What<br> would she do if the baby started coming? She knew she'd rather let<br> Melanie die than go out on the streets to hunt for the doctor when<br> the shells were falling like April rain. And she knew Prissy could<br> be beaten to death before she would venture forth. What would she<br> do if the baby came?<br><br> These matters she discussed with Prissy in whispers one evening, as<br> they prepared Melanie's supper tray, and Prissy, surprisingly<br> enough, calmed her fears.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, effen we kain git de doctah w'en Miss Melly's time<br> come, doan you bodder. Ah kin manage. Ah knows all 'bout<br> birthin'. Ain' mah ma a midwife? Ain' she raise me ter be a<br> midwife, too? Jes' you leave it ter me.’<br><br> Scarlett breathed more easily knowing that experienced hands were<br> near, but she nevertheless yearned to have the ordeal over and done<br> with. Mad to be away from exploding shells, desperate to get home<br> to the quiet of Tara, she prayed every night that the baby would<br> arrive the next day, so she would be released from her promise and<br> could leave Atlanta. Tara seemed so safe, so far away from all<br> this misery.<br><br> Scarlett longed for home and her mother as she had never longed for<br> anything in all her life. If she were just near Ellen she wouldn't<br> be afraid, no matter what happened. Every night after a day of<br> screeching ear-splitting shells, she went to bed determined to tell<br> Melanie the next morning that she could not stand Atlanta another<br> day, that she would have to go home and Melanie would have to go to<br> Mrs. Meade's. But, as she lay on her pillow, there always rose the<br> memory of Ashley's face as it had looked when she last saw him,<br> drawn as with an inner pain but with a little smile on his lips:<br> ‘You'll take care of Melanie, won't you? You're so strong. . . .<br> Promise me.’ And she had promised. Somewhere, Ashley lay dead.<br> Wherever he was, he was watching her, holding her to that promise.<br> Living or dead, she could not fail him, no matter what the cost.<br> So she remained day after day.<br><br> In response to Ellen's letters, pleading with her to come home, she<br> wrote minimizing the dangers of the siege, explaining Melanie's<br> predicament and promising to come as soon as the baby was born.<br> Ellen, sensitive to the bonds of kin, be they blood or marriage,<br> wrote back reluctantly agreeing that she must stay but demanding<br> Wade and Prissy be sent home immediately. This suggestion met with<br> the complete approval of Prissy, who was now reduced to teeth-<br> chattering idiocy at every unexpected sound. She spent so much<br> time crouching in the cellar that the girls would have fared badly<br> but for Mrs. Meade's stolid old Betsy.<br><br> Scarlett was as anxious as her mother to have Wade out of Atlanta,<br> not only for the child's safety, but because his constant fear<br> irritated her. Wade was terrified to speechlessness by the<br> shelling, and even when lulls came he clung to Scarlett's skirts,<br> too terrified to cry. He was afraid to go to bed at night, afraid<br> of the dark, afraid to sleep lest the Yankees should come and get<br> him, and the sound of his soft nervous whimpering in the night<br> grated unendurably on her nerves. Secretly she was just as<br> frightened as he was, but it angered her to be reminded of it every<br> minute by his tense, drawn face. Yes, Tara was the place for Wade.<br> Prissy should take him there and return immediately to be present<br> when the baby came.<br><br> But before Scarlett could start the two on their homeward journey,<br> news came that the Yankees had swung to the south and were<br> skirmishing along the railroad between Atlanta and Jonesboro.<br> Suppose the Yankees should capture the train on which Wade and<br> Prissy were riding--Scarlett and Melanie turned pale at the<br> thought, for everyone knew that Yankee atrocities on helpless<br> children were even more dreadful than on women. So she feared to<br> send him home and he remained in Atlanta, a frightened, silent<br> little ghost, pattering about desperately after his mother, fearing<br> to have her skirt out of his hand for even a minute.<br><br> The siege went on through the hot days of July, thundering days<br> following nights of sullen, ominous stillness, and the town began<br> to adjust itself. It was as though, the worst having happened,<br> they had nothing more to fear. They had feared a siege and now<br> they had a siege and, after all, it wasn't so bad. Life could and<br> did go on almost as usual. They knew they were sitting on a<br> volcano, but until that volcano erupted there was nothing they<br> could do. So why worry now? And probably it wouldn't erupt<br> anyway. Just look how General Hood is holding the Yankees out of<br> the city! And see how the cavalry is holding the railroad to<br> Macon! Sherman will never take it!<br><br> But for all their apparent insouciance in the face of falling<br> shells and shorter rations, for all their ignoring the Yankees,<br> barely half a mile away, and for all their boundless confidence in<br> the ragged line of gray men in the rifle pits, there pulsed, just<br> below the skin of Atlanta, a wild uncertainty over what the next<br> day would bring. Suspense, worry, sorrow, hunger and the torment<br> of rising, falling, rising hope was wearing that skin thin.<br><br> Gradually, Scarlett drew courage from the brave faces of her<br> friends and from the merciful adjustment which nature makes when<br> what cannot be cured must be endured. To be sure, she still jumped<br> at the sound of explosions but she did not run screaming to burrow<br> her head under Melanie's pillow. She could now gulp and say<br> weakly: ‘That was close, wasn't it?’<br><br> She was less frightened also because life had taken on the quality<br> of a dream, a dream too terrible to be real. It wasn't possible<br> that she, Scarlett O'Hara, should be in such a predicament, with<br> the danger of death about her every hour, every minute. It wasn't<br> possible that the quiet tenor of life could have changed so<br> completely in so short a time.<br><br> It was unreal, grotesquely unreal, that morning skies which dawned<br> so tenderly blue could be profaned with cannon smoke that hung over<br> the town like low thunder clouds, that warm noontides filled with<br> the piercing sweetness of massed honeysuckle and climbing roses<br> could be so fearful, as shells screamed into the streets, bursting<br> like the crack of doom, throwing iron splinters hundreds of yards,<br> blowing people and animals to bits.<br><br> Quiet, drowsy afternoon siestas had ceased to be, for though the<br> clamor of battle might lull from time to time, Peachtree Street was<br> alive and noisy at all hours, cannon and ambulances rumbling by,<br> wounded stumbling in from the rifle pits, regiments hurrying past<br> at double-quick, ordered from the ditches on one side of town to<br> the defense of some hard-pressed earthworks on the other, and<br> couriers dashing headlong down the street toward headquarters as<br> though the fate of the Confederacy hung on them.<br><br> The hot nights brought a measure of quiet but it was a sinister<br> quiet. When the night was still, it was too still--as though the<br> tree frogs, katydids and sleepy mockingbirds were too frightened to<br> raise their voices in the usual summer-night chorus. Now and<br> again, the quiet was broken sharply by the crack-cracking of musket<br> fire in the last line of defenses.<br><br> Often in the late night hours, when the lamps were out and Melanie<br> asleep and deathly silence pressed over the town, Scarlett, lying<br> awake, heard the latch of the front gate click and soft urgent<br> tappings on the front door.<br><br> Always, faceless soldiers stood on the dark porch and from the<br> darkness many different voices spoke to her. Sometimes a cultured<br> voice came from the shadows: ‘Madam, my abject apologies for<br> disturbing you, but could I have water for myself and my horse?’<br> Sometimes it was the hard burring of a mountain voice, sometimes<br> the odd nasals of the flat Wiregrass country to the far south,<br> occasionally the lulling drawl of the Coast that caught at her<br> heart, reminding her of Ellen's voice.<br><br> ‘Missy, I got a pardner here who I wuz aimin' ter git ter the<br> horsepittle but looks like he ain't goin' ter last that fer. Kin<br> you take him in?’<br><br> ‘Lady, I shore could do with some vittles. I'd shore relish a corn<br> pone if it didn't deprive you none.’<br><br> ‘Madam, forgive my intrusion but--could I spend the night on your<br> porch? I saw the roses and smelled the honeysuckle and it was so<br> much like home that I was emboldened--’<br><br> No, these nights were not real! They were a nightmare and the men<br> were part of that nightmare, men without bodies or faces, only<br> tired voices speaking to her from the warm dark. Draw water, serve<br> food, lay pillows on the front porch, bind wounds, hold the dirty<br> heads of the dying. No, this could not be happening to her!<br><br> Once, late in July, it was Uncle Henry Hamilton who came tapping in<br> the night. Uncle Henry was minus his umbrella and carpetbag now,<br> and his fat stomach as well. The skin of his pink fat face hung<br> down in loose folds like the dewlaps of a bulldog and his long<br> white hair was indescribably dirty. He was almost barefoot,<br> crawling with lice, and he was hungry, but his irascible spirit was<br> unimpaired.<br><br> Despite his remark: ‘It's a foolish war when old fools like me are<br> out toting guns,’ the girls received the impression that Uncle<br> Henry was enjoying himself. He was needed, like the young men, and<br> he was doing a young man's work. Moreover, he could keep up with<br> the young men, which was more than Grandpa Merriwether could do, he<br> told them gleefully. Grandpa's lumbago was troubling him greatly<br> and the Captain wanted to discharge him. But Grandpa wouldn't go<br> home. He said frankly that he preferred the Captain's swearing and<br> bullying to his daughter-in-law's coddling, and her incessant<br> demands that he give up chewing tobacco and launder his beard every<br> day.<br><br> Uncle Henry's visit was brief, for he had only a four-hour furlough<br> and he needed half of it for the long walk in from the breastworks<br> and back.<br><br> ‘Girls, I'm not going to see you all for a while,’ he announced as<br> he sat in Melanie's bedroom, luxuriously wriggling his blistered<br> feet in the tub of cold water Scarlett had set before him. ‘Our<br> company is going out in the morning.’<br><br> ‘Where?’ questioned Melanie frightened, clutching his arm.<br><br> ‘Don't put your hand on me,’ said Uncle Henry irritably. ‘I'm<br> crawling with lice. War would be a picnic if it wasn't for lice<br> and dysentery. Where'm I going? Well, I haven't been told but<br> I've got a good idea. We're marching south, toward Jonesboro, in<br> the morning, unless I'm greatly in error.’<br><br> ‘Oh, why toward Jonesboro?’<br><br> ‘Because there's going to be big fighting there, Missy. The<br> Yankees are going to take the railroad if they possibly can. And<br> if they do take it, it's good-by Atlanta!’<br><br> ‘Oh, Uncle Henry, do you think they will?’<br><br> ‘Shucks, girls! No! How can they when I'm there?’ Uncle Henry<br> grinned at their frightened faces and then, becoming serious again:<br> ‘It's going to be a hard fight, girls. We've got to win it. You<br> know, of course, that the Yankees have got all the railroads except<br> the one to Macon, but that isn't all they've got. Maybe you girls<br> didn't know it, but they've got every road, too, every wagon lane<br> and bridle path, except the McDonough road. Atlanta's in a bag and<br> the strings of the bag are at Jonesboro. And if the Yankees can<br> take the railroad there, they can pull up the strings and have us,<br> just like a possum in a poke. So, we don't aim to let them get<br> that railroad. . . . I may be gone a while, girls. I just came in<br> to tell you all good-by and to make sure Scarlett was still with<br> you, Melly.’<br><br> ‘Of course, she's with me,’ said Melanie fondly. ‘Don't you worry<br> about us, Uncle Henry, and do take care of yourself.’<br><br> Uncle Henry wiped his wet feet on the rag rug and groaned as he<br> drew on his tattered shoes.<br><br> ‘I got to be going,’ he said. ‘I've got five miles to walk.<br> Scarlett, you fix me up some kind of lunch to take. Anything<br> you've got.’<br><br> After he had kissed Melanie good-by, he went down to the kitchen<br> where Scarlett was wrapping a corn pone and some apples in a<br> napkin.<br><br> ‘Uncle Henry--is it--is it really so serious?’<br><br> ‘Serious? God'lmighty, yes! Don't be a goose. We're in the last<br> ditch.’<br><br> ‘Do you think they'll get to Tara?’<br><br> ‘Why--’ began Uncle Henry, irritated at the feminine mind which<br> thought only of personal things when broad issues were involved.<br> Then, seeing her frightened, woebegone face, he softened.<br><br> ‘Of course they won't. Tara's five miles from the railroad and<br> it's the railroad the Yankees want. You've got no more sense than<br> a June bug, Missy.’ He broke off abruptly. ‘I didn't walk all<br> this way here tonight just to tell you all good-by. I came to<br> bring Melly some bad news, but when I got up to it I just couldn't<br> tell her. So I'm going to leave it to you to do.’<br><br> ‘Ashley isn't--you haven't heard anything--that he's--dead?’<br><br> ‘Now, how would I be hearing about Ashley when I've been standing<br> in rifle pits up to the seat of my pants in mud?’ the old gentleman<br> asked testily. ‘No. It's about his father. John Wilkes is dead.’<br><br> Scarlett sat down suddenly, the half-wrapped lunch in her hand.<br><br> ‘I came to tell Melly--but I couldn't. You must do it. And give<br> her these.’<br><br> He hauled from his pockets a heavy gold watch with dangling seals,<br> a small miniature of the long dead Mrs. Wilkes and a pair of<br> massive cuff buttons. At the sight of the watch which she had seen<br> in John Wilkes' hands a thousand times, the full realization came<br> over Scarlett that Ashley's father was really dead. And she was<br> too stunned to cry or to speak. Uncle Henry fidgeted, coughed and<br> did not look at her, lest he catch sight of a tear that would upset<br> him.<br><br> ‘He was a brave man, Scarlett. Tell Melly that. Tell her to write<br> it to his girls. And a good soldier for all his years. A shell<br> got him. Came right down on him and his horse. Tore the horse's--<br> I shot the horse myself, poor creature. A fine little mare she<br> was. You'd better write Mrs. Tarleton about that, too. She set a<br> store on that mare. Wrap up my lunch, child. I must be going.<br> There, dear, don't take it so hard. What better way can an old man<br> die than doing a young man's work?’<br><br> ‘Oh, he shouldn't have died! He shouldn't have ever gone to the<br> war. He should have lived and seen his grandchild grow up and died<br> peacefully in bed. Oh, why did he go? He didn't believe in<br> secession and he hated the war and--’<br><br> ‘Plenty of us think that way, but what of it?’ Uncle Henry blew<br> his nose grumpily. ‘Do you think I enjoy letting Yankee riflemen<br> use me for a target at my age? But there's no other choice for a<br> gentleman these days. Kiss me good-by, child, and don't worry<br> about me. I'll come through this war safely.’<br><br> Scarlett kissed him and heard him go down the steps into the dark,<br> heard the latch click on the front gate. She stood for a minute<br> looking at the keepsakes in her hand. And then she went up the<br> stairs to tell Melanie.<br><br> <br><br> At the end of July came the unwelcome news, predicted by Uncle<br> Henry, that the Yankees had swung around again toward Jonesboro.<br> They had cut the railroad four miles below the town, but they had<br> been beaten off by the Confederate cavalry; and the engineering<br> corps, sweating in the broiling sun, had repaired the line.<br><br> Scarlett was frantic with anxiety. For three days she waited, fear<br> growing in her heart. Then a reassuring letter came from Gerald.<br> The enemy had not reached Tara. They had heard the sound of the<br> fight but they had seen no Yankees.<br><br> Gerald's letter was so full of brag and bluster as to how the<br> Yankees had been driven from the railroad that one would have<br> thought he personally had accomplished the feat, single handed.<br> He wrote for three pages about the gallantry of the troops and then,<br> at the end of his letter, mentioned briefly that Carreen was ill.<br> The typhoid, Mrs. O'Hara said it was. She was not very ill and<br> Scarlett was not to worry about her, but on no condition must she<br> come home now, even if the railroad should become safe. Mrs. O'Hara<br> was very glad now that Scarlett and Wade had not come home when the<br> siege began. Mrs. O'Hara said Scarlett must go to church and say<br> some Rosaries for Carreen's recovery.<br><br> Scarlett's conscience smote her at this last, for it had been<br> months since she had been to church. Once she would have thought<br> this omission a mortal sin but, somehow, staying away from church<br> did not seem so sinful now as it formerly had. But she obeyed her<br> mother and going to her room gabbled a hasty Rosary. When she rose<br> from her knees she did not feel as comforted as she had formerly<br> felt after prayer. For some time she had felt that God was not<br> watching out for her, the Confederates or the South, in spite of<br> the millions of prayers ascending to Him daily.<br><br> That night she sat on the front porch with Gerald's letter in her<br> bosom where she could touch it occasionally and bring Tara and<br> Ellen closer to her. The lamp in the parlor window threw odd<br> golden shadows onto the dark vine-shrouded porch, and the matted<br> tangle of yellow climbing roses and honeysuckle made a wall of<br> mingled fragrance about her. The night was utterly still. Not<br> even the crack of a rifle had sounded since sunset and the world<br> seemed far away. Scarlett rocked back and forth, lonely, miserable<br> since reading the news from Tara, wishing that someone, anyone,<br> even Mrs. Merriwether, were with her. But Mrs. Merriwether was on<br> night duty at the hospital, Mrs. Meade was at home making a feast<br> for Phil, who was in from the front lines, and Melanie was asleep.<br> There was not even the hope of a chance caller. Visitors had<br> fallen off to nothing this last week, for every man who could walk<br> was in the rifle pits or chasing the Yankees about the countryside<br> near Jonesboro.<br><br> It was not often that she was alone like this and she did not like<br> it. When she was alone she had to think and, these days, thoughts<br> were not so pleasant. Like everyone else, she had fallen into the<br> habit of thinking of the past, the dead.<br><br> Tonight when Atlanta was so quiet, she could close her eyes and<br> imagine she was back in the rural stillness of Tara and that life<br> was unchanged, unchanging. But she knew that life in the County<br> would never be the same again. She thought of the four Tarletons,<br> the red-haired twins and Tom and Boyd, and a passionate sadness<br> caught at her throat. Why, either Stu or Brent might have been her<br> husband. But now, when the war was over and she went back to Tara<br> to live, she would never again hear their wild halloos as they<br> dashed up the avenue of cedars. And Raiford Calvert, who danced so<br> divinely, would never again choose her to be his partner. And the<br> Munroe boys and little Joe Fontaine and--<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley!’ she sobbed, dropping her head into her hands. ‘I'll<br> never get used to you being gone!’<br><br> She heard the front gate click and she hastily raised her head and<br> dashed her hand across her wet eyes. She rose and saw it was Rhett<br> Butler coming up the walk, carrying his wide Panama hat in his<br> hand. She had not seen him since the day when she had alighted<br> from his carriage so precipitously at Five Points. On that<br> occasion, she had expressed the desire never to lay eyes on him<br> again. But she was so glad now to have someone to talk to, someone<br> to divert her thoughts from Ashley, that she hastily put the memory<br> from her mind. Evidently he had forgotten the contretemps, or<br> pretended to have forgotten it, for he settled himself on the top<br> step at her feet without mention of their late difference.<br><br> ‘So you didn't refugee to Macon! I heard that Miss Pitty had<br> retreated and, of course, I thought you had gone too. So, when I<br> saw your light I came here to investigate. Why did you stay?’<br><br> ‘To keep Melanie company. You see, she--well, she can't refugee<br> just now.’<br><br> ‘Thunderation,’ he said, and in the lamplight she saw that he was<br> frowning. ‘You don't mean to tell me Mrs. Wilkes is still here? I<br> never heard of such idiocy. It's quite dangerous for her in her<br> condition.’<br><br> Scarlett was silent, embarrassed, for Melanie's condition was not a<br> subject she could discuss with a man. She was embarrassed, too,<br> that Rhett should know it was dangerous for Melanie. Such<br> knowledge sat ill upon a bachelor.<br><br> ‘It's quite ungallant of you not to think that I might get hurt<br> too,’ she said tartly.<br><br> His eyes flickered with amusement.<br><br> ‘I'd back you against the Yankees any day.’<br><br> ‘I'm not sure that that's a compliment,’ she said uncertainly.<br><br> ‘It isn't,’ he answered. ‘When will you stop looking for<br> compliments in men's lightest utterances?’<br><br> ‘When I'm on my deathbed,’ she replied and smiled, thinking that<br> there would always be men to compliment her, even if Rhett never<br> did.<br><br> ‘Vanity, vanity,’ he said. ‘At least, you are frank about it.’<br><br> He opened his cigar case, extracted a black cigar and held it to<br> his nose for a moment. A match flared, he leaned back against a<br> post and, clasping his hands about his knees, smoked a while in<br> silence. Scarlett resumed her rocking and the still darkness of<br> the warm night closed about them. The mockingbird, which nested in<br> the tangle of roses and honeysuckle, roused from slumber and gave<br> one timid, liquid note. Then, as if thinking better of the matter,<br> it was silent again.<br><br> From the shadow of the porch, Rhett suddenly laughed, a low, soft<br> laugh.<br><br> ‘So you stayed with Mrs. Wilkes! This is the strangest situation I<br> ever encountered!’<br><br> ‘I see nothing strange about it,’ she answered uncomfortably,<br> immediately on the alert.<br><br> ‘No? But then you lack the impersonal viewpoint. My impression<br> has been for some time past that you could hardly endure Mrs.<br> Wilkes. You think her silly and stupid and her patriotic notions<br> bore you. You seldom pass by the opportunity to slip in some<br> belittling remark about her, so naturally it seems strange to me<br> that you should elect to do the unselfish thing and stay here with<br> her during this shelling. Now, just why did you do it?’<br><br> ‘Because she's Charlie's sister--and like a sister to me,’ answered<br> Scarlett with as much dignity as possible though her cheeks were<br> growing hot.<br><br> ‘You mean because she's Ashley's Wilkes' widow.’<br><br> Scarlett rose quickly, struggling with her anger.<br><br> ‘I was almost on the point of forgiving you for your former boorish<br> conduct but now I shan't do it. I wouldn't have ever let you come<br> upon this porch at all, if I hadn't been feeling so blue and--’<br><br> ‘Sit down and smooth your ruffled fur,’ he said, and his voice<br> changed. He reached up and taking her hand pulled her back into<br> her chair. ‘Why are you blue?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I had a letter from Tara today. The Yankees are close to home<br> and my little sister is ill with typhoid and--and--so now, even if<br> I could go home, like I want to, Mother wouldn't let me for fear<br> I'd catch it too. Oh, dear, and I do so want to go home!’<br><br> ‘Well, don't cry about it,’ he said, but his voice was kinder.<br> ‘You are much safer here in Atlanta even if the Yankees do come<br> than you'd be at Tara. The Yankees won't hurt you and typhoid<br> would.’<br><br> ‘The Yankees wouldn't hurt me! How can you say such a lie?’<br><br> ‘My dear girl, the Yankees aren't fiends. They haven't horns and<br> hoofs, as you seem to think. They are pretty much like<br> Southerners--except with worse manners, of course, and terrible<br> accents.’<br><br> ‘Why, the Yankees would--’<br><br> ‘Rape you? I think not. Though, of course, they'd want to.’<br><br> ‘If you are going to talk vilely I shall go into the house,’ she<br> cried, grateful that the shadows hid her crimson face.<br><br> ‘Be frank. Wasn't that what you were thinking?’<br><br> ‘Oh, certainly not!’<br><br> ‘Oh, but it was! No use getting mad at me for reading your<br> thoughts. That's what all our delicately nurtured and pure-minded<br> Southern ladies think. They have it on their minds constantly.<br> I'll wager even dowagers like Mrs. Merriwether . . .’<br><br> Scarlett gulped in silence, remembering that wherever two or more<br> matrons were gathered together, in these trying days, they<br> whispered of such happenings, always in Virginia or Tennessee or<br> Lousiana, never close to home. The Yankees raped women and ran<br> bayonets through children's stomachs and burned houses over the<br> heads of old people. Everyone knew these things were true even if<br> they didn't shout them on the street corners. And if Rhett had any<br> decency he would realize they were true. And not talk about them.<br> And it wasn't any laughing matter either.<br><br> She could hear him chuckling softly. Sometimes he was odious. In<br> fact, most of the time he was odious. It was awful for a man to<br> know what women really thought about and talked about. It made a<br> girl feel positively undressed. And no man ever learned such<br> things from good women either. She was indignant that he had read<br> her mind. She liked to believe herself a thing of mystery to men,<br> but she knew Rhett thought her as transparent as glass.<br><br> ‘Speaking of such matters,’ he continued, ‘have you a protector or<br> chaperon in the house? The admirable Mrs. Merriwether or Mrs.<br> Meade? They always look at me as if they knew I was here for no<br> good purpose.’<br><br> ‘Mrs. Meade usually comes over at night,’ answered Scarlett, glad<br> to change the subject. ‘But she couldn't tonight. Phil, her boy,<br> is home.’<br><br> ‘What luck,’ he said softly, ‘to find you alone.’<br><br> Something in his voice made her heart beat pleasantly faster and<br> she felt her face flush. She had heard that note in men's voices<br> often enough to know that it presaged a declaration of love. Oh,<br> what fun! If he would just say he loved her, how she would torment<br> him and get even with him for all the sarcastic remarks he had<br> flung at her these past three years. She would lead him a chase<br> that would make up for even that awful humiliation of the day he<br> witnessed her slapping Ashley. And then she'd tell him sweetly she<br> could only be a sister to him and retire with the full honors of<br> war. She laughed nervously in pleasant anticipation.<br><br> ‘Don't giggle,’ he said, and taking her hand, he turned it over and<br> pressed his lips into the palm. Something vital, electric, leaped<br> from him to her at the touch of his warm mouth, something that<br> caressed her whole body thrillingly. His lips traveled to her<br> wrist and she knew he must feel the leap of her pulse as her heart<br> quickened and she tried to draw back her hand. She had not<br> bargained on this--this treacherous warm tide of feeling that made<br> her want to run her hands through his hair, to feel his lips upon<br> her mouth.<br><br> She wasn't in love with him, she told herself confusedly. She was<br> in love with Ashley. But how to explain this feeling that made her<br> hands shake and the pit of her stomach grow cold?<br><br> He laughed softly.<br><br> ‘Don't pull away! I won't hurt you!’<br><br> ‘Hurt me? I'm not afraid of you, Rhett Butler, or of any man in<br> shoe leather!’ she cried, furious that her voice shook as well as<br> her hands.<br><br> ‘An admirable sentiment, but do lower your voice. Mrs. Wilkes<br> might hear you. And pray compose yourself.’ He sounded as though<br> delighted at her flurry.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, you do like me, don't you?’<br><br> That was more like what she was expecting.<br><br> ‘Well, sometimes,’ she answered cautiously. ‘When you aren't<br> acting like a varmint.’<br><br> He laughed again and held the palm of her hand against his hard<br> cheek.<br><br> ‘I think you like me because I am a varmint. You've known so few<br> dyed-in-the-wool varmints in your sheltered life that my very<br> difference holds a quaint charm for you.’<br><br> This was not the turn she had anticipated and she tried again<br> without success to pull her hand free.<br><br> ‘That's not true! I like nice men--men you can depend on to always<br> be gentlemanly.’<br><br> ‘You mean men you can always bully. It's merely a matter of<br> definition. But no matter.’<br><br> He kissed her palm again, and again the skin on the back of her<br> neck crawled excitingly.<br><br> ‘But you do like me. Could you ever love me, Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘Ah!’ she thought, triumphantly. ‘Now I've got him!’ And she<br> answered with studied coolness: ‘Indeed, no. That is--not unless<br> you mended your manners considerably.’<br><br> ‘And I have no intention of mending them. So you could not love<br> me? That is as I hoped. For while I like you immensely, I do not<br> love you and it would be tragic indeed for you to suffer twice from<br> unrequited love, wouldn't it, dear? May I call you 'dear,' Mrs.<br> Hamilton? I shall call you 'dear' whether you like it or not, so<br> no matter, but the proprieties must be observed.’<br><br> ‘You don't love me?’<br><br> ‘No, indeed. Did you hope that I did?’<br><br> ‘Don't be so presumptuous!’<br><br> ‘You hoped! Alas, to blight your hopes! I should love you, for<br> you are charming and talented at many useless accomplishments. But<br> many ladies have charm and accomplishments and are just as useless<br> as you are. No, I don't love you. But I do like you tremendously--<br> for the elasticity of your conscience, for the selfishness which<br> you seldom trouble to hide, and for the shrewd practicality in you<br> which, I fear, you get from some not too remote Irish-peasant<br> ancestor.’<br><br> Peasant! Why, he was insulting her! She began to splutter<br> wordlessly.<br><br> ‘Don't interrupt,’ he begged, squeezing her hand. ‘I like you<br> because I have those same qualities in me and like begets liking.<br> I realize you still cherish the memory of the godlike and wooden-<br> headed Mr. Wilkes, who's probably been in his grave these six<br> months. But there must be room in your heart for me too.<br> Scarlett, do stop wriggling! I am making you a declaration. I<br> have wanted you since the first time I laid eyes on you, in the<br> hall of Twelve Oaks, when you were bewitching poor Charlie<br> Hamilton. I want you more than I have ever wanted any woman--and<br> I've waited longer for you than I've ever waited for any woman.’<br><br> She was breathless with surprise at his last words. In spite of<br> all his insults, he did love her and he was just so contrary he<br> didn't want to come out frankly and put it into words, for fear<br> she'd laugh. Well, she'd show him and right quickly.<br><br> ‘Are you asking me to marry you?’<br><br> He dropped her hand and laughed so loudly she shrank back in her<br> chair.<br><br> ‘Good Lord, no! Didn't I tell you I wasn't a marrying man?’<br><br> ‘But--but--what--’<br><br> He rose to his feet and, hand on heart, made her a burlesque bow.<br><br> ‘Dear,’ he said quietly, ‘I am complimenting your intelligence by<br> asking you to be my mistress without having first seduced you.’<br><br> Mistress!<br><br> Her mind shouted the word, shouted that she had been vilely<br> insulted. But in that first startled moment she did not feel<br> insulted. She only felt a furious surge of indignation that he<br> should think her such a fool. He must think her a fool if he<br> offered her a proposition like that, instead of the proposal of<br> matrimony she had been expecting. Rage, punctured vanity and<br> disappointment threw her mind into a turmoil and, before she even<br> thought of the high moral grounds on which she should upbraid him,<br> she blurted out the first words which came to her lips--<br><br> ‘Mistress! What would I get out of that except a passel of brats?’<br><br> And then her jaw dropped in horror as she realized what she had<br> said. He laughed until he choked, peering at her in the shadows as<br> she sat, stricken dumb, pressing her handkerchief to her mouth.<br><br> ‘That's why I like you! You are the only frank woman I know, the<br> only woman who looks on the practical side of matters without<br> beclouding the issue with mouthings about sin and morality. Any<br> other woman would have swooned first and then shown me the door.’<br><br> Scarlett leaped to her feet, her face red with shame. How could<br> she have said such a thing! How could she, Ellen's daughter, with<br> her upbringing, have sat there and listened to such debasing words<br> and then made such a shameless reply? She should have screamed.<br> She should have fainted. She should have turned coldly away in<br> silence and swept from the porch. Too late now!<br><br> ‘I will show you the door,’ she shouted, not caring if Melanie or<br> the Meades, down the street, did hear her. ‘Get out! How dare you<br> say such things to me! What have I ever done to encourage you--to<br> make you suppose. . . . Get out and don't ever come back here. I<br> mean it this time. Don't you ever come back here with any of your<br> piddling papers of pins and ribbons, thinking I'll forgive you.<br> I'll--I'll tell my father and he'll kill you!’<br><br> He picked up his hat and bowed and she saw in the light of the lamp<br> that his teeth were showing in a smile beneath his mustache. He<br> was not ashamed, he was amused at what she had said, and he was<br> watching her with alert interest.<br><br> Oh, he was detestable! She swung round on her heel and marched<br> into the house. She grabbed hold of the door to shut it with a<br> bang, but the hook which held it open was too heavy for her. She<br> struggled with it, panting.<br><br> ‘May I help you?’ he asked.<br><br> Feeling that she would burst a blood vessel if she stayed another<br> minute, she stormed up the stairs. And as she reached the upper<br> floor, she heard him obligingly slam the door for her.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XX<br><br> <br> As the hot noisy days of August were drawing to a close the<br> bombardment abruptly ceased. The quiet that fell on the town was<br> startling. Neighbors met on the streets and stared at one another,<br> uncertain, uneasy, as to what might be impending. The stillness,<br> after the screaming days, brought no surcease to strained nerves<br> but, if possible, made the strain even worse. No one knew why the<br> Yankee batteries were silent; there was no news of the troops<br> except that they had been withdrawn in large numbers from the<br> breastworks about the town and had marched off toward the south to<br> defend the railroad. No one knew where the fighting was, if indeed<br> there was any fighting, or how the battle was going if there was a<br> battle.<br><br> Nowadays the only news was that which passed from mouth to mouth.<br> Short of paper, short of ink, short of men, the newspapers had<br> suspended publication after the siege began, and the wildest rumors<br> appeared from nowhere and swept through the town. Now, in the<br> anxious quiet, crowds stormed General Hood's headquarters demanding<br> information, crowds massed about the telegraph office and the depot<br> hoping for tidings, good tidings, for everyone hoped that the<br> silence of Sherman's cannon meant that the Yankees were in full<br> retreat and the Confederates chasing them back up the road to<br> Dalton. But no news came. The telegraph wires were still, no<br> trains came in on the one remaining railroad from the south and the<br> mail service was broken.<br><br> Autumn with its dusty, breathless heat was slipping in to choke the<br> suddenly quiet town, adding its dry, panting weight to tired,<br> anxious hearts. To Scarlett, mad to hear from Tara, yet trying to<br> keep up a brave face, it seemed an eternity since the siege began,<br> seemed as though she had always lived with the sound of cannon in<br> her ears until this sinister quiet had fallen. And yet, it was<br> only thirty days since the siege began. Thirty days of siege! The<br> city ringed with red-clay rifle pits, the monotonous booming of<br> cannon that never rested, the long lines of ambulances and ox carts<br> dripping blood down the dusty streets toward the hospitals, the<br> overworked burial squads dragging out men when they were hardly<br> cold and dumping them like so many logs in endless rows of shallow<br> ditches. Only thirty days!<br><br> And it was only four months since the Yankees moved south from<br> Dalton! Only four months! Scarlett thought, looking back on that<br> far day, that it had occurred in another life. Oh, no! Surely not<br> just four months. It had been a lifetime.<br><br> Four months ago! Why, four months ago Dalton, Resaca, Kennesaw<br> Mountain had been to her only names of places on the railroad. Now<br> they were battles, battles desperately, vainly fought as Johnston<br> fell back toward Atlanta. And now, Peachtree Creek, Decatur, Ezra<br> Church and Utoy Creek were no longer pleasant names of pleasant<br> places. Never again could she think of them as quiet villages full<br> of welcoming friends, as green places where she picnicked with<br> handsome officers on the soft banks of slow-moving streams. These<br> names meant battles too, and the soft green grasses where she had<br> sat were cut to bits by heavy cannon wheels, trampled by desperate<br> feet when bayonet met bayonet and flattened where bodies threshed<br> in agonies. . . . And the lazy streams were redder now than ever<br> Georgia clay could make them. Peachtree Creek was crimson, so they<br> said, after the Yankees crossed it. Peachtree Creek, Decatur, Ezra<br> Church, Utoy Creek. Never names of places any more. Names of<br> graves where friends lay buried, names of tangled underbrush and<br> thick woods where bodies rotted unburied, names of the four sides<br> of Atlanta where Sherman had tried to force his army in and Hood's<br> men had doggedly beaten him back.<br><br> At last, news came from the south to the strained town and it was<br> alarming news, especially to Scarlett. General Sherman was trying<br> the fourth side of the town again, striking again at the railroad<br> at Jonesboro. Yankees in large numbers were on that fourth side of<br> the town now, no skirmishing units or cavalry detachments but the<br> massed Yankee forces. And thousands of Confederate troops had been<br> withdrawn from the lines close about the city to hurl themselves<br> against them. And that explained the sudden silence.<br><br> ‘Why Jonesboro?’ thought Scarlett, terror striking at her heart at<br> the thought of Tara's nearness. ‘Why must they always hit<br> Jonesboro? Why can't they find some other place to attack the<br> railroad?’<br><br> For a week she had not heard from Tara and the last brief note from<br> Gerald had added to her fears. Carreen had taken a turn for the<br> worse and was very, very sick. Now it might be days before the<br> mails came through, days before she heard whether Carreen was alive<br> or dead. Oh, if she had only gone home at the beginning of the<br> siege, Melanie or no Melanie!<br><br> There was fighting at Jonesboro--that much Atlanta knew, but how<br> the battle went no one could tell and the most insane rumors<br> tortured the town. Finally a courier came up from Jonesboro with<br> the reassuring news that the Yankees had been beaten back. But<br> they had made a sortie into Jonesboro, burned the depot, cut the<br> telegraph wires and torn up three miles of track before they<br> retreated. The engineering corps was working like mad, repairing<br> the line, but it would take some time because the Yankees had torn<br> up the crossties, made bonfires of them, laid the wrenched-up rails<br> across them until they were red hot and then twisted them around<br> telegraph poles until they looked like giant corkscrews. These<br> days it was so hard to replace iron rails, to replace anything made<br> of iron.<br><br> No, the Yankees hadn't gotten to Tara. The same courier who<br> brought the dispatches to General Hood assured Scarlett of that.<br> He had met Gerald in Jonesboro after the battle, just as he was<br> starting to Atlanta, and Gerald had begged him to bring a letter to<br> her.<br><br> But what was Pa doing in Jonesboro? The young courier looked ill<br> at ease as he made answer. Gerald was hunting for an army doctor<br> to go to Tara with him.<br><br> As she stood in the sunshine on the front porch, thanking the young<br> man for his trouble, Scarlett felt her knees go weak. Carreen must<br> be dying if she was so far beyond Ellen's medical skill that Gerald<br> was hunting a doctor! As the courier went off in a small whirlwind<br> of red dust, Scarlett tore open Gerald's letter with fingers that<br> trembled. So great was the shortage of paper in the Confederacy<br> now that Gerald's note was written between the lines of her last<br> letter to him and reading it was difficult.<br><br> ‘Dear Daughter, Your Mother and both girls have the typhoid. They<br> are very ill but we must hope for the best. When your mother took<br> to her bed she bade me write you that under no condition were you<br> to come home and expose yourself and Wade to the disease. She<br> sends her love and bids you pray for her.’<br><br> ‘Pray for her!’ Scarlett flew up the stairs to her room and,<br> dropping on her knees by the bed, prayed as she had never prayed<br> before. No formal Rosaries now but the same words over and over:<br> ‘Mother of God, don't let her die! I'll be so good if you don't<br> let her die! Please, don't let her die!’<br><br> For the next week Scarlett crept about the house like a stricken<br> animal, waiting for news, starting at every sound of horses'<br> hooves, rushing down the dark stair at night when soldiers came<br> tapping at the door, but no news came from Tara. The width of the<br> continent might have spread between her and home instead of twenty-<br> five miles of dusty road.<br><br> The mails were still disrupted, no one knew where the Confederates<br> were or what the Yankees were up to. No one knew anything except<br> that thousands of soldiers, gray and blue, were somewhere between<br> Atlanta and Jonesboro. Not a word from Tara in a week.<br><br> Scarlett had seen enough typhoid in the Atlanta hospital to know<br> what a week meant in that dread disease. Ellen was ill, perhaps<br> dying, and here was Scarlett helpless in Atlanta with a pregnant<br> woman on her hands and two armies between her and home. Ellen was<br> ill--perhaps dying. But Ellen couldn't be ill! She had never been<br> ill. The very thought was incredible and it struck at the very<br> foundations of the security of Scarlett's life. Everyone else got<br> sick, but never Ellen. Ellen looked after sick people and made<br> them well again. She couldn't be sick. Scarlett wanted to be<br> home. She wanted Tara with the desperate desire of a frightened<br> child frantic for the only haven it had ever known.<br><br> Home! The sprawling white house with fluttering white curtains at<br> the windows, the thick clover on the lawn with the bees busy in it,<br> the little black boy on the front steps shooing the ducks and<br> turkeys from the flower beds, the serene red fields and the miles<br> and miles of cotton turning white in the sun! Home!<br><br> If she had only gone home at the beginning of the siege, when<br> everyone else was refugeeing! She could have taken Melanie with<br> her in safety with weeks to spare.<br><br> ‘Oh, damn Melanie!’ she thought a thousand times. ‘Why couldn't<br> she have gone to Macon with Aunt Pitty? That's where she belongs,<br> with her own kinfolks, not with me. I'm none of her blood. Why<br> does she hang onto me so hard? If she'd only gone to Macon, then<br> I could have gone home to Mother. Even now--even now, I'd take a<br> chance on getting home in spite of the Yankees, if it wasn't for<br> this baby. Maybe General Hood would give me an escort. He's a<br> nice man, General Hood, and I know I could make him give me an<br> escort and a flag of truce to get me through the lines. But I have<br> to wait for this baby! . . . Oh, Mother! Mother! Don't die! . . .<br> Why don't this baby ever come? I'll see Dr. Meade today and ask<br> him if there's any way to hurry babies up so I can go home--if I<br> can get an escort. Dr. Meade said she'd have a bad time. Dear<br> God! Suppose she should die! Melanie dead. Melanie dead. And<br> Ashley-- No, I mustn't think about that, it isn't nice. But<br> Ashley-- No, I mustn't think about that because he's probably<br> dead, anyway. But he made me promise I'd take care of her. But--<br> if I didn't take care of her and she died and Ashley is still<br> alive-- No, I mustn't think about that. It's sinful. And I<br> promised God I'd be good if He would just not let Mother die. Oh,<br> if the baby would only come. If I could only get away from here--<br> get home--get anywhere but here.’<br><br> Scarlett hated the sight of the ominously still town now and once<br> she had loved it. Atlanta was no longer the gay, the desperately<br> gay place she had loved. It was a hideous place like a plague-<br> stricken city so quiet, so dreadfully quiet after the din of the<br> siege. There had been stimulation in the noise and the danger of<br> the shelling. There was only horror in the quiet that followed.<br> The town seemed haunted, haunted with fear and uncertainty and<br> memories. People's faces looked pinched and the few soldiers<br> Scarlett saw wore the exhausted look of racers forcing themselves<br> on through the last lap of a race already lost.<br><br> The last day of August came and with it convincing rumors that the<br> fiercest fighting since the battle of Atlanta was taking place.<br> Somewhere to the south. Atlanta, waiting for news of the turn of<br> battle, stopped even trying to laugh and joke. Everyone knew now<br> what the soldiers had known two weeks before--that Atlanta was in<br> the last ditch, that if the Macon railroad fell, Atlanta would fall<br> too.<br><br> <br><br> On the morning of the first of September, Scarlett awoke with a<br> suffocating sense of dread upon her, a dread she had taken to her<br> pillow the night before. She thought, dulled with sleep: ‘What<br> was it I was worrying about when I went to bed last night? Oh,<br> yes, the fighting. There was a battle, somewhere, yesterday! Oh,<br> who won?’ She sat up hastily, rubbing her eyes, and her worried<br> heart took up yesterday's load again.<br><br> The air was oppressive even in the early morning hour, hot with the<br> scorching promise of a noon of glaring blue sky and pitiless bronze<br> sun. The road outside lay silent. No wagons creaked by. No<br> troops raised the red dust with their tramping feet. There were no<br> sounds of negroes' lazy voices in neighboring kitchens, no pleasant<br> sounds of breakfasts being prepared, for all the near neighbors<br> except Mrs. Meade and Mrs. Merriwether had refugeed to Macon. And<br> she could hear nothing from their houses either. Farther down the<br> street the business section was quiet and many of the stores and<br> offices were locked and boarded up, while their occupants were<br> somewhere about the countryside with rifles in their hands.<br><br> The stillness that greeted her seemed even more sinister this<br> morning than on any of the mornings of the queer quiet week<br> preceding it. She rose hastily, without her usual preliminary<br> burrowings and stretchings, and went to the window, hoping to see<br> some neighbor's face, some heartening sight. But the road was<br> empty. She noted how the leaves on the trees were still dark green<br> but dry and heavily coated with red dust, and how withered and sad<br> the untended flowers in the front yard looked.<br><br> As she stood, looking out of the window, there came to her ears a<br> far-off sound, faint and sullen as the first distant thunder of an<br> approaching storm.<br><br> ‘Rain,’ she thought in the first moment, and her country-bred mind<br> added, ‘we certainly need it.’ But, in a split instant: ‘Rain?<br> No! Not rain! Cannon!’<br><br> Her heart racing, she leaned from the window, her ear cocked to the<br> far-off roaring, trying to discover from which direction it came.<br> But the dim thundering was so distant that, for a moment, she could<br> not tell. ‘Make it from Marietta, Lord!’ she prayed. ‘Or Decatur.<br> Or Peachtree Creek. But not from the south! Not from the south!’<br> She gripped the window still tighter and strained her ears and the<br> far-away booming seemed louder. And it was coming from the south.<br><br> Cannon to the south! And to the south lay Jonesboro and Tara--and<br> Ellen.<br><br> Yankees perhaps at Tara, now, this minute! She listened again but<br> the blood thudding in her ears all but blurred out the sound of<br> far-off firing. No, they couldn't be at Jonesboro yet. If they<br> were that far away, the sound would be fainter, more indistinct.<br> But they must be at least ten miles down the road toward Jonesboro,<br> probably near the little settlement of Rough and Ready. But<br> Jonesboro was scarcely more than ten miles below Rough and Ready.<br><br> Cannon to the south, and they might be tolling the knell of<br> Atlanta's fall. But to Scarlett, sick for her mother's safety,<br> fighting to the south only meant fighting near Tara. She walked<br> the floor and wrung her hands and for the first time the thought in<br> all its implications came to her that the gray army might be<br> defeated. It was the thought of Sherman's thousands so close to<br> Tara that brought it all home to her, brought the full horror of<br> the war to her as no sound of siege guns shattering windowpanes, no<br> privations of food and clothing and no endless rows of dying men<br> had done. Sherman's army within a few miles of Tara! And even if<br> the Yankees should be defeated, they might fall back down the road<br> to Tara. And Gerald couldn't possibly refugee out of their way<br> with three sick women.<br><br> Oh, if she were only there now, Yankees or not. She paced the<br> floor in her bare feet, her nightgown clinging to her legs and the<br> more she walked the stronger became her foreboding. She wanted to<br> be at home. She wanted to be near Ellen.<br><br> From the kitchen below, she heard the rattle of china as Prissy<br> prepared breakfast, but no sound of Mrs. Meade's Betsy. The<br> shrill, melancholy minor of Prissy was raised, ‘Jes' a few mo'<br> days, ter tote de wee-ry load . . .’ The song grated on Scarlett,<br> its sad implications frightening her, and slipping on a wrapper she<br> pattered out into the hall and to the back stairs and shouted:<br> ‘Shut up that singing, Prissy!’<br><br> A sullen ‘Yas'm’ drifted up to her and she drew a deep breath,<br> feeling suddenly ashamed of herself.<br><br> ‘Where's Betsy?’<br><br> ‘Ah doan know. She ain' came.’<br><br> Scarlett walked to Melanie's door and opened it a crack, peering<br> into the sunny room. Melanie lay in bed in her nightgown, her eyes<br> closed and circled with black, her heart-shaped face bloated, her<br> slender body hideous and distorted. Scarlett wished viciously that<br> Ashley could see her now. She looked worse than any pregnant woman<br> she had ever seen. As she looked, Melanie's eyes opened and a soft<br> warm smile lit her face.<br><br> ‘Come in,’ she invited, turning awkwardly on her side. ‘I've been<br> awake since sun-up thinking, and, Scarlett, there's something I<br> want to ask you.’<br><br> She entered the room and sat down on the bed that was glaring with<br> harsh sunshine.<br><br> Melanie reached out and took Scarlett's hand in a gentle confiding<br> clasp.<br><br> ‘Dear,’ she said, ‘I'm sorry about the cannon. It's toward<br> Jonesboro, isn't it?’<br><br> Scarlett said ‘Um,’ her heart beginning to beat faster as the<br> thought recurred.<br><br> ‘I know how worried you are. I know you'd have gone home last week<br> when you heard about your mother, if it hadn't been for me.<br> Wouldn't you?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said Scarlett ungraciously.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, darling. You've been so good to me. No sister could<br> have been sweeter or braver. And I love you for it. I'm so sorry<br> I'm in the way.’<br><br> Scarlett stared. Loved her, did she? The fool!<br><br> ‘And Scarlett, I've been lying here thinking and I want to ask a<br> very great favor of you.’ Her clasp tightened. ‘If I should die,<br> will you take my baby?’<br><br> Melanie's eyes were wide and bright with soft urgency.<br><br> ‘Will you?’<br><br> Scarlett jerked away her hand as fear swamped her. Fear roughened<br> her voice as she spoke.<br><br> ‘Oh, don't be a goose, Melly. You aren't going to die. Every<br> woman thinks she's going to die with her first baby. I know I<br> did.’<br><br> ‘No, you didn't. You've never been afraid of anything. You are<br> just saying that to try to cheer me up. I'm not afraid to die but<br> I'm so afraid to leave the baby, if Ashley is-- Scarlett, promise<br> me that you'll take my baby if I should die. Then I won't be<br> afraid. Aunt Pittypat is too old to raise a child and Honey and<br> India are sweet but--I want you to have my baby. Promise me,<br> Scarlett. And if it's a boy, bring him up like Ashley, and if it's<br> a girl--dear, I'd like her to be like you.’<br><br> ‘God's nightgown!’ cried Scarlett, leaping from the bed. ‘Aren't<br> things bad enough without you talking about dying?’<br><br> ‘I'm sorry, dear. But promise me. I think it'll be today. I'm<br> sure it'll be today. Please promise me.’<br><br> ‘Oh, all right, I promise,’ said Scarlett, looking down at her in<br> bewilderment.<br><br> Was Melanie such a fool she really didn't know how she cared for<br> Ashley? Or did she know everything and feel that because of that<br> love, Scarlett would take good care of Ashley's child? Scarlett<br> had a wild impulse to cry out questions, but they died on her lips<br> as Melanie took her hand and held it for an instant against her<br> cheek. Tranquillity had come back into her eyes.<br><br> ‘Why do you think it will be today, Melly?’<br><br> ‘I've been having pains since dawn--but not very bad ones.’<br><br> ‘You have? Well, why didn't you call me? I'll send Prissy for Dr.<br> Meade.’<br><br> ‘No, don't do that yet, Scarlett. You know how busy he is, how<br> busy they all are. Just send word to him that we'll need him some<br> time today. Send over to Mrs. Meade's and tell her and ask her to<br> come over and sit with me. She'll know when to really send for<br> him.’<br><br> ‘Oh, stop being so unselfish. You know you need a doctor as much<br> as anybody in the hospital. I'll send for him right away.’<br><br> ‘No, please don't. Sometimes it takes all day having a baby and I<br> just couldn't let the doctor sit here for hours when all those poor<br> boys need him so much. Just send for Mrs. Meade. She'll know.’<br><br> ‘Oh, all right,’ said Scarlett.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXI<br><br> <br> After sending up Melanie's breakfast tray, Scarlett dispatched<br> Prissy for Mrs. Meade and sat down with Wade to eat her own<br> breakfast. But for once she had no appetite. Between her nervous<br> apprehension over the thought that Melanie's time was approaching<br> and her unconscious straining to hear the sound of the cannon, she<br> could hardly eat. Her heart acted very queerly, beating regularly<br> for several minutes and then thumping so loudly and swiftly it<br> almost made her sick at her stomach. The heavy hominy stuck in her<br> throat like glue and never before had the mixture of parched corn<br> and ground-up yams that passed for coffee been so repulsive.<br> Without sugar or cream it was bitter as gall, for the sorghum used<br> for ‘long sweetening’ did little to improve the taste. After one<br> swallow she pushed her cup away. If for no other reason she hated<br> the Yankees because they kept her from having real coffee with<br> sugar and thick cream in it.<br><br> Wade was quieter than usual and did not set up his every morning<br> complaint against the hominy that he so disliked. He ate silently<br> the spoonfuls she pushed into his mouth and washed them down with<br> noisily gulped water. His soft brown eyes followed her every<br> movement, large, round as dollars, a childish bewilderment in them<br> as though her own scarce-hidden fears had been communicated to him.<br> When he had finished she sent him off to the back yard to play and<br> watched him toddle across the straggling grass to his playhouse<br> with great relief.<br><br> She arose and stood irresolutely at the foot of the stairs. She<br> should go up and sit with Melanie and distract her mind from her<br> coming ordeal but she did not feel equal to it. Of all days in the<br> world, Melanie had to pick this day to have the baby! And of all<br> days to talk about dying!<br><br> She sat down on the bottom step of the stairs and tried to compose<br> herself, wondering again how yesterday's battle had gone, wondering<br> how today's fighting was going. How strange to have a big battle<br> going on just a few miles away and to know nothing of it! How<br> strange the quiet of this deserted end of town in contrast with the<br> day of the fighting at Peachtree Creek! Aunt Pitty's house was one<br> of the last on the north side of Atlanta and with the fighting<br> somewhere to the far south, there were no reinforcements going by<br> at double-quick, no ambulances and staggering lines of walking<br> wounded coming back. She wondered if such scenes were being<br> enacted on the south side of town and thanked God she was not<br> there. If only everyone except the Meades and the Merriwethers had<br> not refugeed from this north end of Peachtree! It made her feel<br> forsaken and alone. She wished fervently that Uncle Peter were<br> with her so he could go down to headquarters and learn the news.<br> If it wasn't for Melanie she'd go to town this very minute and<br> learn for herself, but she couldn't leave until Mrs. Meade arrived.<br> Mrs. Meade. Why didn't she come on? And where was Prissy?<br><br> She rose and went out onto the front porch and looked for them<br> impatiently, but the Meade house was around a shady bend in the<br> street and she could see no one. After a long while Prissy came<br> into view, alone, switching her skirts from side to side and<br> looking over her shoulder to observe the effect.<br><br> ‘You're as slow as molasses in January,’ snapped Scarlett as Prissy<br> opened the gate. ‘What did Mrs. Meade say? How soon will she be<br> over here?’<br><br> ‘She warn't dar,’ said Prissy.<br><br> ‘Where is she? When will she be home?’<br><br> ‘Well'm,’ answered Prissy, dragging out her words pleasurably to<br> give more weight to her message. ‘Dey Cookie say Miss Meade done<br> got wud early dis mawnin' dat young Mist' Phil done been shot an'<br> Miss Meade she tuck de cah'ige an' Ole Talbot an' Betsy an' dey<br> done gone ter fotch him home. Cookie say he bad hurt an' Miss<br> Meade ain' gwine ter be studyin' 'bout comin' up hyah.’<br><br> Scarlett stared at her and had an impulse to shake her. Negroes<br> were always so proud of being the bearers of evil tidings.<br><br> ‘Well, don't stand there like a ninny. Go down to Mrs.<br> Merriwether's and ask her to come up or send her mammy. Now,<br> hurry.’<br><br> ‘Dey ain' dar, Miss Scarlett. Ah drapped in ter pass time of de<br> day wid Mammy on mah way home. Dey's done gone. House all locked<br> up. Spec dey's at de horsepittle.’<br><br> ‘So that's where you were so long! Whenever I send you somewhere<br> you go where I tell you and don't stop to 'pass any time' with<br> anybody. Go--’<br><br> She stopped and racked her brain. Who was left in town among their<br> friends who would be helpful? There was Mrs. Elsing. Of course,<br> Mrs. Elsing didn't like her at all these days but she had always<br> been fond of Melanie.<br><br> ‘Go to Mrs. Elsing's, and explain everything very carefully and<br> tell her to please come up here. And, Prissy, listen to me. Miss<br> Melly's baby is due and she may need you any minute now. Now you<br> hurry right straight back.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm,’ said Prissy and, turning, sauntered down the walk at<br> snail's gait.<br><br> ‘Hurry, you slow poke!’<br><br> ‘Yas'm.’<br><br> Prissy quickened her gait infinitesimally and Scarlett went back<br> into the house. She hesitated again before going upstairs to<br> Melanie. She would have to explain to her just why Mrs. Meade<br> couldn't come and the knowledge that Phil Meade was badly wounded<br> might upset her. Well, she'd tell a lie about it.<br><br> She entered Melanie's room and saw that the breakfast tray was<br> untouched. Melanie lay on her side, her face white.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Meade's over at the hospital,’ said Scarlett. ‘But Mrs.<br> Elsing is coming. Do you feel bad?’<br><br> ‘Not very,’ lied Melanie. ‘Scarlett, how long did it take Wade to<br> get born?’<br><br> ‘Less than no time,’ answered Scarlett with a cheerfulness she was<br> far from feeling. ‘I was out in the yard and I didn't hardly have<br> time to get into the house. Mammy said it was scandalous--just<br> like one of the darkies.’<br><br> ‘I hope I'll be like one of the darkies too,’ said Melanie,<br> mustering a smile which suddenly disappeared as pain contorted her<br> face.<br><br> Scarlett looked down at Melanie's tiny hips with none too sanguine<br> hopes but said reassuringly: ‘Oh, it's not really so bad.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I know it isn't. I'm afraid I'm a little coward. Is--is Mrs.<br> Elsing coming right away?’<br><br> ‘Yes, right away,’ said Scarlett. ‘I'll go down and get some fresh<br> water and sponge you off. It's so hot today.’<br><br> She took as long a time as possible in getting the water, running<br> to the front door every two minutes to see if Prissy were coming.<br> There was no sign of Prissy so she went back upstairs, sponged<br> Melanie's perspiring body and combed out her long dark hair.<br><br> When an hour had passed she heard scuffing negro feet coming down<br> the street, and looking out of the window, saw Prissy returning<br> slowly, switching herself as before and tossing her head with as<br> many airy affectations as if she had a large and interested<br> audience.<br><br> ‘Some day, I'm going to take a strap to that little wench,’ thought<br> Scarlett savagely, hurrying down the stairs to meet her.<br><br> ‘Miss Elsing ober at de horsepittle. Dey Cookie 'lows a whole lot<br> of wounded sojers come in on de early train. Cookie fixin' soup<br> ter tek over dar. She say--’<br><br> ‘Never mind what she said,’ interrupted Scarlett, her heart<br> sinking. ‘Put on a clean apron because I want you to go over to<br> the hospital. I'm going to give you a note to Dr. Meade, and if he<br> isn't there, give it to Dr. Jones or any of the other doctors. And<br> if you don't hurry back this time, I'll skin you alive.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm.’<br><br> ‘And ask any of the gentlemen for news of the fighting. If they<br> don't know, go by the depot and ask the engineers who brought the<br> wounded in. Ask if they are fighting at Jonesboro or near there.’<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty, Miss Scarlett!’ and sudden fright was in Prissy's<br> black face. ‘De Yankees ain' at Tara, is dey?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. I'm telling you to ask for news.’<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty, Miss Scarlett! Whut'll dey do ter Maw?’<br><br> Prissy began to bawl suddenly, loudly, the sound adding to<br> Scarlett's own uneasiness.<br><br> ‘Stop bawling! Miss Melanie will hear you. Now go change your<br> apron, quick.’<br><br> Spurred to speed, Prissy hurried toward the back of the house while<br> Scarlett scratched a hasty note on the margin of Gerald's last<br> letter to her--the only bit of paper in the house. As she folded<br> it, so that her note was uppermost, she caught Gerald's words,<br> ‘Your mother--typhoid--under no condition--to come home--’ She<br> almost sobbed. If it wasn't for Melanie, she'd start home, right<br> this minute, if she had to walk every step of the way.<br><br> Prissy went off at a trot, the letter gripped in her hand, and<br> Scarlett went back upstairs, trying to think of some plausible lie<br> to explain Mrs. Elsing's failure to appear. But Melanie asked no<br> questions. She lay upon her back, her face tranquil and sweet, and<br> the sight of her quieted Scarlett for a while.<br><br> She sat down and tried to talk of inconsequential things, but the<br> thoughts of Tara and a possible defeat by the Yankees prodded<br> cruelly. She thought of Ellen dying and of the Yankees coming into<br> Atlanta, burning everything, killing everybody. Through it all,<br> the dull far-off thundering persisted, rolling into her ears in<br> waves of fear. Finally, she could not talk at all and only stared<br> out of the window at the hot still street and the dusty leaves<br> hanging motionless on the trees. Melanie was silent too, but at<br> intervals her quiet face was wrenched with pain.<br><br> She said, after each pain: ‘It wasn't very bad, really,’ and<br> Scarlett knew she was lying. She would have preferred a loud<br> scream to silent endurance. She knew she should feel sorry for<br> Melanie, but somehow she could not muster a spark of sympathy. Her<br> mind was too torn with her own anguish. Once she looked sharply at<br> the pain-twisted face and wondered why it should be that she, of<br> all people in the world, should be here with Melanie at this<br> particular time--she who had nothing in common with her, who hated<br> her, who would gladly have seen her dead. Well, maybe she'd have<br> her wish, and before the day was over too. A cold superstitious<br> fear swept her at this thought. It was bad luck to wish that<br> someone were dead, almost as bad luck as to curse someone. Curses<br> came home to roost, Mammy said. She hastily prayed that Melanie<br> wouldn't die and broke into feverish small talk, hardly aware of<br> what she said. At last, Melanie put a hot hand on her wrist.<br><br> ‘Don't bother about talking, dear. I know how worried you are.<br> I'm so sorry I'm so much trouble.’<br><br> Scarlett relapsed into silence but she could not sit still. What<br> would she do if neither the doctor nor Prissy got there in time?<br> She walked to the window and looked down the street and came back<br> and sat down again. Then she rose and looked out of the window on<br> the other side of the room.<br><br> An hour went by and then another. Noon came and the sun was high<br> and hot and not a breath of air stirred the dusty leaves.<br> Melanie's pains were harder now. Her long hair was drenched in<br> sweat and her gown stuck in wet spots to her body. Scarlett<br> sponged her face in silence but fear was gnawing at her. God in<br> Heaven, suppose the baby came before the doctor arrived! What<br> would she do? She knew less than nothing of midwifery. This was<br> exactly the emergency she had been dreading for weeks. She had<br> been counting on Prissy to handle the situation if no doctor should<br> be available. Prissy knew all about midwifery. She'd said so time<br> and again. But where was Prissy? Why didn't she come? Why didn't<br> the doctor come? She went to the window and looked again. She<br> listened hard and suddenly she wondered if it were only her<br> imagination or if the sound of cannon in the distance had died<br> away. If it were farther away it would mean that the fighting was<br> nearer Jonesboro and that would mean--<br><br> At last she saw Prissy coming down the street at a quick trot and<br> she leaned out of the window. Prissy, looking up, saw her and her<br> mouth opened to yell. Seeing the panic written on the little black<br> face and fearing she might alarm Melanie by crying out evil<br> tidings, Scarlett hastily put her finger to her lips and left the<br> window.<br><br> ‘I'll get some cooler water,’ she said, looking down into Melanie's<br> dark, deep-circled eyes and trying to smile. Then she hastily left<br> the room, closing the door carefully behind her.<br><br> Prissy was sitting on the bottom step in the hall, panting.<br><br> ‘Dey's fightin' at Jonesboro, Miss Scarlett! Dey say our gempmums<br> is gittin' beat. Oh, Gawd, Miss Scarlett! Whut'll happen ter Maw<br> an' Poke? Oh, Gawd, Miss Scarlett! Whut'll happen ter us effen de<br> Yankees gits hyah? Oh, Gawd--’<br><br> Scarlett clapped a hand over the blubbery mouth.<br><br> ‘For God's sake, hush!’<br><br> Yes, what would happen to them if the Yankees came--what would<br> happen to Tara? She pushed the thought firmly back into her mind<br> and grappled with the more pressing emergency. If she thought of<br> these things, she'd begin to scream and bawl like Prissy.<br><br> ‘Where's Dr. Meade? When's he coming?’<br><br> ‘Ah ain' nebber seed him, Miss Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘What!’<br><br> ‘No'm, he ain' at de horsepittle. Miss Merriwether an' Miss Elsing<br> ain' dar needer. A man he tole me de doctah down by de car shed<br> wid the wounded sojers jes' come in frum Jonesboro, but Miss<br> Scarlett, Ah wuz sceered ter go down dar ter de shed--dey's folkses<br> dyin' down dar. Ah's sceered of daid folkses--’<br><br> ‘What about the other doctors?’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, fo' Gawd, Ah couldn' sceercely git one of dem ter<br> read yo' note. Dey wukin' in de horsepittle lak dey all done gone<br> crazy. One doctah he say ter me, 'Damn yo' hide! Doan you come<br> roun' hyah bodderin' me 'bout babies w'en we got a mess of men<br> dyin' hyah. Git some woman ter he'p you.' An' den Ah went aroun'<br> an' about an' ask fer news lak you done tole me an' dey all say<br> 'fightin' at Jonesboro' an' Ah--’<br><br> ‘You say Dr. Meade's at the depot?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm. He--’<br><br> ‘Now, listen sharp to me. I'm going to get Dr. Meade and I want<br> you to sit by Miss Melanie and do anything she says. And if you so<br> much as breathe to her where the fighting is, I'll sell you South<br> as sure as gun's iron. And don't you tell her that the other<br> doctors wouldn't come either. Do you hear?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm.’<br><br> ‘Wipe your eyes and get a fresh pitcher of water and go on up.<br> Sponge her off. Tell her I've gone for Dr. Meade.’<br><br> ‘Is her time nigh, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. I'm afraid it is but I don't know. You should<br> know. Go on up.’<br><br> Scarlett caught up her wide straw bonnet from the console table and<br> jammed it on her head. She looked in the mirror and automatically<br> pushed up loose strands of hair but she did not see her own<br> reflection. Cold little ripples of fear that started in the pit of<br> her stomach were radiating outward until the fingers that touched<br> her cheeks were cold, though the rest of her body streamed<br> perspiration. She hurried out of the house and into the heat of<br> the sun. It was blindingly, glaring hot and as she hurried down<br> Peachtree Street her temples began to throb from the heat. From<br> far down the street she could hear the rise and fall and roar of<br> many voices. By the time she caught sight of the Leyden house, she<br> was beginning to pant, for her stays were tightly laced, but she<br> did not slow her gait. The roar of noise grew louder.<br><br> From the Leyden house down to Five Points, the street seethed with<br> activity, the activity of an anthill just destroyed. Negroes were<br> running up and down the street, panic in their faces; and on<br> porches, white children sat crying untended. The street was<br> crowded with army wagons and ambulances filled with wounded and<br> carriages piled high with valises and pieces of furniture. Men on<br> horseback dashed out of side streets pell-mell down Peachtree<br> toward Hood's headquarters. In front of the Bonnell house, old<br> Amos stood holding the head of the carriage horse and he greeted<br> Scarlett with rolling eyes.<br><br> ‘Ain't you gone yit, Miss Scarlett? We is goin' now. Ole Miss<br> packin' her bag.’<br><br> ‘Going? Where?’<br><br> ‘Gawd knows, Miss. Somewheres. De Yankees is comin'!’<br><br> She hurried on, not even saying good-by. The Yankees were coming!<br> At Wesley Chapel, she paused to catch her breath and wait for her<br> hammering heart to subside. If she did not quiet herself she would<br> certainly faint. As she stood clutching a lamp post for support,<br> she saw an officer on horseback come charging up the street from<br> Five Points and, on an impulse, she ran out into the street and<br> waved at him.<br><br> ‘Oh, stop! Please, stop!’<br><br> He reined in so suddenly the horse went back on its haunches,<br> pawing the air. There were harsh lines of fatigue and urgency in<br> his face but his tattered gray hat was off with a sweep.<br><br> ‘Madam?’<br><br> ‘Tell me, is it true? Are the Yankees coming?’<br><br> ‘I'm afraid so.’<br><br> ‘Do you know so?’<br><br> ‘Yes, Ma'm. I know so. A dispatch came in to headquarters half an<br> hour ago from the fighting at Jonesboro.’<br><br> ‘At Jonesboro? Are you sure?’<br><br> ‘I'm sure. There's no use telling pretty lies, Madam. The message<br> was from General Hardee and it said: 'I have lost the battle and<br> am in full retreat.'‘<br><br> ‘Oh, my God!’<br><br> The dark face of the tired man looked down without emotion. He<br> gathered the reins again and put on his hat.<br><br> ‘Oh, sir, please, just a minute. What shall we do?’<br><br> ‘Madam, I can't say. The army is evacuating Atlanta soon.’<br><br> ‘Going off and leaving us to the Yankees?’<br><br> ‘I'm afraid so.’<br><br> The spurred horse went off as though on springs and Scarlett was<br> left standing in the middle of the street with the red dust thick<br> upon her ankles.<br><br> The Yankees were coming. The army was leaving. The Yankees were<br> coming. What should she do? Where should she run? No, she<br> couldn't run. There was Melanie back there in the bed expecting<br> that baby. Oh, why did women have babies? If it wasn't for<br> Melanie she could take Wade and Prissy and hide in the woods where<br> the Yankees could never find them. But she couldn't take Melanie<br> to the woods. No, not now. Oh, if she'd only had the baby sooner,<br> yesterday even, perhaps they could get an ambulance and take her<br> away and hide her somewhere. But now--she must find Dr. Meade and<br> make him come home with her. Perhaps he could hurry the baby.<br><br> She gathered up her skirts and ran down the street, and the rhythm<br> of her feet was ‘The Yankees are coming! The Yankees are coming!’<br> Five Points was crowded with people who rushed here and there with<br> unseeing eyes, jammed with wagons, ambulances, ox carts, carriages<br> loaded with wounded. A roaring sound like the breaking of surf<br> rose from the crowd.<br><br> Then a strangely incongruous sight struck her eyes. Throngs of<br> women were coming up from the direction of the railroad tracks<br> carrying hams across their shoulders. Little children hurried by<br> their sides, staggering under buckets of steaming molasses. Young<br> boys dragged sacks of corn and potatoes. One old man struggled<br> along with a small barrel of flour on a wheelbarrow. Men, women<br> and children, black and white, hurried, hurried with straining<br> faces, lugging packages and sacks and boxes of food--more food than<br> she had seen in a year. The crowd suddenly gave a lane for a<br> careening carriage and through the lane came the frail and elegant<br> Mrs. Elsing, standing up in the front of her victoria, reins in one<br> hand, whip in the other. She was hatless and white faced and her<br> long gray hair streamed down her back as she lashed the horse like<br> a Fury. Jouncing on the back seat of the carriage was her black<br> mammy, Melissy, clutching a greasy side of bacon to her with one<br> hand, while with the other and both feet she attempted to hold the<br> boxes and bags piled all about her. One bag of dried peas had<br> burst and the peas strewed themselves into the street. Scarlett<br> screamed to her, but the tumult of the crowd drowned her voice and<br> the carriage rocked madly by.<br><br> For a moment she could not understand what it all meant and then,<br> remembering that the commissary warehouses were down by the<br> railroad tracks, she realized that the army had thrown them open to<br> the people to salvage what they could before the Yankees came.<br><br> She pushed her way swiftly through the crowds, past the packed,<br> hysterical mob surging in the open space of Five Points, and<br> hurried as fast as she could down the short block toward the depot.<br> Through the tangle of ambulances and the clouds of dust, she could<br> see doctors and stretcher bearers bending, lifting, hurrying.<br> Thank God, she'd find Dr. Meade soon. As she rounded the corner of<br> the Atlanta Hotel and came in full view of the depot and the<br> tracks, she halted appalled.<br><br> Lying in the pitiless sun, shoulder to shoulder, head to feet, were<br> hundreds of wounded men, lining the tracks, the sidewalks,<br> stretched out in endless rows under the car shed. Some lay stiff<br> and still but many writhed under the hot sun, moaning. Everywhere,<br> swarms of flies hovered over the men, crawling and buzzing in their<br> faces, everywhere was blood, dirty bandages, groans, screamed<br> curses of pain as stretcher bearers lifted men. The smell of<br> sweat, of blood, of unwashed bodies, of excrement rose up in waves<br> of blistering heat until the fetid stench almost nauseated her.<br> The ambulance men hurrying here and there among the prostrate forms<br> frequently stepped on wounded men, so thickly packed were the rows,<br> and those trodden upon stared stolidly up, waiting their turn.<br><br> She shrank back, clapping her hand to her mouth feeling that she<br> was going to vomit. She couldn't go on. She had seen wounded men<br> in the hospitals, wounded men on Aunt Pitty's lawn after the<br> fighting at the creek, but never anything like this. Never<br> anything like these stinking, bleeding bodies broiling under the<br> glaring sun. This was an inferno of pain and smell and noise and<br> hurry--hurry--hurry! The Yankees are coming! The Yankees are<br> coming!<br><br> She braced her shoulders and went down among them, straining her<br> eyes among the upright figures to distinguish Dr. Meade. But she<br> discovered she could not look for him, for if she did not step<br> carefully she would tread on some poor soldier. She raised her<br> skirts and tried to pick her way among them toward a knot of men<br> who were directing the stretcher bearers.<br><br> As she walked, feverish hands plucked at her skirt and voices<br> croaked: ‘Lady--water! Please, lady, water! For Christ's sake,<br> water!’<br><br> Perspiration came down her face in streams as she pulled her skirts<br> from clutching hands. If she stepped on one of these men, she'd<br> scream and faint. She stepped over dead men, over men who lay dull<br> eyed with hands clutched to bellies where dried blood had glued<br> torn uniforms to wounds, over men whose beards were stiff with<br> blood and from whose broken jaws came sounds which must mean:<br><br> ‘Water! Water!’<br><br> If she did not find Dr. Meade soon, she would begin screaming with<br> hysteria. She looked toward the group of men under the car shed<br> and cried as loudly as she could:<br><br> ‘Dr. Meade! Is Dr. Meade there?’<br><br> From the group one man detached himself and looked toward her. It<br> was the doctor. He was coatless and his sleeves were rolled up to<br> his shoulders. His shirt and trousers were as red as a butcher's<br> and even the end of his iron-gray beard was matted with blood. His<br> face was the face of a man drunk with fatigue and impotent rage and<br> burning pity. It was gray and dusty, and sweat had streaked long<br> rivulets across his cheeks. But his voice was calm and decisive as<br> he called to her.<br><br> ‘Thank God, you are here. I can use every pair of hands.’<br><br> For a moment she stared at him bewildered, dropping her skirts in<br> dismay. They fell over the dirty face of a wounded man who feebly<br> tried to turn his head to escape from their smothering folds. What<br> did the doctor mean? The dust from the ambulances came into her<br> face with choking dryness, and the rotten smells were like a foul<br> liquid in her nostrils.<br><br> ‘Hurry, child! Come here.’<br><br> She picked up her skirts and went to him as fast as she could go<br> across the rows of bodies. She put her hand on his arm and felt<br> that it was trembling with weariness but there was no weakness in<br> his face.<br><br> ‘Oh, Doctor!’ she cried. ‘You must come. Melanie is having her<br> baby.’<br><br> He looked at her as if her words did not register on his mind. A<br> man who lay upon the ground at her feet, his head pillowed on his<br> canteen, grinned up companionably at her words.<br><br> ‘They will do it,’ he said cheerfully.<br><br> She did not even look down but shook the doctor's arm.<br><br> ‘It's Melanie. The baby. Doctor, you must come. She--the--’<br> This was no time for delicacy but it was hard to bring out the<br> words with the ears of hundreds of strange men listening.<br><br> ‘The pains are getting hard. Please, Doctor!’<br><br> ‘A baby? Great God!’ thundered the doctor and his face was<br> suddenly contorted with hate and rage, a rage not directed at her<br> or at anyone except a world wherein such things could happen. ‘Are<br> you crazy? I can't leave these men. They are dying, hundreds of<br> them. I can't leave them for a damned baby. Get some woman to<br> help you. Get my wife.’<br><br> She opened her mouth to tell him why Mrs. Meade could not come and<br> then shut it abruptly. He did not know his own son was wounded!<br> She wondered if he would still be here if he did know, and<br> something told her that even if Phil were dying he would still be<br> standing on this spot, giving aid to the many instead of the one.<br><br> ‘No, you must come, Doctor. You know you said she'd have a hard<br> time--’ Was it really she, Scarlett, standing here saying these<br> dreadful indelicate things at the top of her voice in this hell of<br> heat and groans? ‘She'll die if you don't come!’<br><br> He shook off her hand roughly and spoke as though he hardly heard<br> her, hardly knew what she said.<br><br> ‘Die? Yes, they'll all die--all these men. No bandages, no<br> salves, no quinine, no chloroform. Oh, God, for some morphia!<br> Just a little morphia for the worst ones. Just a little<br> chloroform. God damn the Yankees! God damn the Yankees!’<br><br> ‘Give um hell, Doctor!’ said the man on the ground, his teeth<br> showing in his beard.<br><br> Scarlett began to shake and her eyes burned with tears of fright.<br> The doctor wasn't coming with her. Melanie would die and she had<br> wished that she would die. The doctor wasn't coming.<br><br> ‘Name of God, Doctor! Please!’<br><br> Dr. Meade bit his lip and his jaw hardened as his face went cool<br> again.<br><br> ‘Child, I'll try. I can't promise you. But I'll try. When we get<br> these men tended to. The Yankees are coming and the troops are<br> moving out of town. I don't know what they'll do with the wounded.<br> There aren't any trains. The Macon line has been captured. . . .<br> But I'll try. Run along now. Don't bother me. There's nothing<br> much to bringing a baby. Just tie up the cord. . . .’<br><br> He turned as an orderly touched his arm and began firing directions<br> and pointing to this and that wounded man. The man at her feet<br> looked up at Scarlett compassionately. She turned away, for the<br> doctor had forgotten her.<br><br> She picked her way rapidly through the wounded and back to<br> Peachtree Street. The doctor wasn't coming. She would have to see<br> it through herself. Thank God, Prissy knew all about midwifery.<br> Her head ached from the heat and she could feel her basque, soaking<br> wet from perspiration, sticking to her. Her mind felt numb and so<br> did her legs, numb as in a nightmare when she tried to run and<br> could not move them. She thought of the long walk back to the<br> house and it seemed interminable.<br><br> Then, ‘The Yankees are coming!’ began to beat its refrain in her<br> mind again. Her heart began to pound and new life came into her<br> limbs. She hurried into the crowd at Five Points, now so thick<br> there was no room on the narrow sidewalks and she was forced to<br> walk in the street. Long lines of soldiers were passing, dust<br> covered, sodden with weariness. There seemed thousands of them,<br> bearded, dirty, their guns slung over their shoulders, swiftly<br> passing at route step. Cannon rolled past, the drivers flaying the<br> thin mules with lengths of rawhide. Commissary wagons with torn<br> canvas covers rocked through the ruts. Cavalry raising clouds of<br> choking dust went past endlessly. She had never seen so many<br> soldiers together before. Retreat! Retreat! The army was moving<br> out.<br><br> The hurrying lines pushed her back onto the packed sidewalk and she<br> smelled the reek of cheap corn whisky. There were women in the mob<br> near Decatur Street, garishly dressed women whose bright finery and<br> painted faces gave a discordant note of holiday. Most of them were<br> drunk and the soldiers on whose arms they hung were drunker. She<br> caught a fleeting glimpse of a head of red curls and saw that<br> creature, Belle Watling, heard her shrill drunken laughter as she<br> clung for support to a one-armed soldier who reeled and staggered.<br><br> When she had shoved and pushed her way through the mob for a block<br> beyond Five Points the crowd thinned a little and, gathering up her<br> skirts, she began to run again. When she reached Wesley Chapel,<br> she was breathless and dizzy and sick at her stomach. Her stays<br> were cutting her ribs in two. She sank down on the steps of the<br> church and buried her head in her hands until she could breathe<br> more easily. If she could only get one deep breath, way down in<br> her abdomen. If her heart would only stop bumping and drumming and<br> cavorting. If there were only someone in this mad place to whom<br> she could turn.<br><br> Why, she had never had to do a thing for herself in all her life.<br> There had always been someone to do things for her, to look after<br> her, shelter and protect her and spoil her. It was incredible that<br> she could be in such a fix. Not a friend, not a neighbor to help<br> her. There had always been friends, neighbors, the competent hands<br> of willing slaves. And now in this hour of greatest need, there<br> was no one. It was incredible that she could be so completely<br> alone, and frightened, and far from home.<br><br> Home! If she were only home, Yankees or no Yankees. Home, even if<br> Ellen was sick. She longed for the sight of Ellen's sweet face,<br> for Mammy's strong arms around her.<br><br> She rose dizzily to her feet and started walking again. When she<br> came in sight of the house, she saw Wade swinging on the front<br> gate. When he saw her, his face puckered and he began to cry,<br> holding up a grubby bruised finger.<br><br> ‘Hurt!’ he sobbed. ‘Hurt!’<br><br> ‘Hush! Hush! Hush! Or I'll spank you. Go out in the back yard<br> and make mud pies and don't move from there.’<br><br> ‘Wade hungwy,’ he sobbed and put the hurt finger in his mouth.<br><br> ‘I don't care. Go in the back yard and--’<br><br> She looked up and saw Prissy leaning out of the upstairs window,<br> fright and worry written on her face; but in an instant they were<br> wiped away in relief as she saw her mistress. Scarlett beckoned to<br> her to come down and went into the house. How cool it was in the<br> hall. She untied her bonnet and flung it on the table, drawing her<br> forearms across her wet forehead. She heard the upstairs door open<br> and a low wailing moan, wrenched from the depths of agony, came to<br> her ears. Prissy came down the stairs three at a time.<br><br> ‘Is de doctah come?’<br><br> ‘No. He can't come.’<br><br> ‘Gawd, Miss Scarlett! Miss Melly bad off!’<br><br> ‘The doctor can't come. Nobody can come. You've got to bring the<br> baby and I'll help you.’<br><br> Prissy's mouth fell open and her tongue wagged wordlessly. She<br> looked at Scarlett sideways and scuffed her feet and twisted her<br> thin body.<br><br> ‘Don't look so simple minded!’ cried Scarlett, infuriated at her<br> silly expression. ‘What's the matter?’<br><br> Prissy edged back up the stairs.<br><br> ‘Fo' Gawd, Miss Scarlett--’ Fright and shame were in her rolling<br> eyes.<br><br> ‘Well?’<br><br> ‘Fo' Gawd, Miss Scarlett! We's got ter have a doctah. Ah--Ah--<br> Miss Scarlett, Ah doan know nuthin' 'bout bringin' babies. Maw<br> wouldn' nebber lemme be 'round folkses whut wuz havin' dem.’<br><br> All the breath went out of Scarlett's lungs in one gasp of horror<br> before rage swept her. Prissy made a lunge past her, bent on<br> flight, but Scarlett grabbed her.<br><br> ‘You black liar--what do you mean? You've been saying you knew<br> everything about birthing babies. What is the truth? Tell me!’<br> She shook her until the kinky head rocked drunkenly.<br><br> ‘Ah's lyin', Miss Scarlett! Ah doan know huccome Ah tell sech a<br> lie. Ah jes' see one baby birthed, an' Maw she lak ter wo' me out<br> fer watchin'.’<br><br> Scarlett glared at her and Prissy shrank back, trying to pull<br> loose. For a moment her mind refused to accept the truth, but when<br> realization finally came to her that Prissy knew no more about<br> midwifery than she did, anger went over her like a flame. She had<br> never struck a slave in all her life, but now she slapped the black<br> cheek with all the force in her tired arm. Prissy screamed at the<br> top of her voice, more from fright than pain, and began to dance up<br> and down, writhing to break Scarlett's grip.<br><br> As she screamed, the moaning from the second floor ceased and a<br> moment later Melanie's voice, weak and trembling, called:<br> ‘Scarlett? Is it you? Please come! Please!’<br><br> Scarlett dropped Prissy's arm and the wench sank whimpering to the<br> steps. For a moment Scarlett stood still, looking up, listening to<br> the low moaning which had begun again. As she stood there, it<br> seemed as though a yoke descended heavily upon her neck, felt as<br> though a heavy load were harnessed to it, a load she would feel as<br> soon as she took a step.<br><br> She tried to think of all the things Mammy and Ellen had done for<br> her when Wade was born but the merciful blurring of the childbirth<br> pains obscured almost everything in mist. She did recall a few<br> things and she spoke to Prissy rapidly, authority in her voice.<br><br> ‘Build a fire in the stove and keep hot water boiling in the<br> kettle. And bring up all the towels you can find and that ball of<br> twine. And get me the scissors. Don't come telling me you can't<br> find them. Get them and get them quick. Now hurry.’<br><br> She jerked Prissy to her feet and sent her kitchenwards with a<br> shove. Then she squared her shoulders and started up the stairs.<br> It was going to be difficult, telling Melanie that she and Prissy<br> were to deliver her baby.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXII<br><br> <br> There would never again be an afternoon as long as this one. Or as<br> hot. Or as full of lazy insolent flies. They swarmed on Melanie<br> despite the fan Scarlett kept in constant motion. Her arms ached<br> from swinging the wide palmetto leaf. All her efforts seemed<br> futile, for while she brushed them from Melanie's moist face, they<br> crawled on her clammy feet and legs and made her jerk them weakly<br> and cry: ‘Please! On my feet!’<br><br> The room was in semigloom, for Scarlett had pulled down the shades<br> to shut out the heat and brightness. Pin points of sunlight came<br> in through minute holes in the shades and about the edges. The<br> room was an oven and Scarlett's sweat-drenched clothes never dried<br> but became wetter and stickier as the hours went by. Prissy was<br> crouched in a corner, sweating too, and smelled so abominably<br> Scarlett would have sent her from the room had she not feared the<br> girl would take to her heels if once out of sight. Melanie lay on<br> the bed on a sheet dark with perspiration and splotched with<br> dampness where Scarlett had spilled water. She twisted endlessly,<br> to one side, to the other, to left, to right and back again.<br><br> Sometimes she tried to sit up and fell back and began twisting<br> again. At first, she had tried to keep from crying out, biting her<br> lips until they were raw, and Scarlett, whose nerves were as raw as<br> the lips, said huskily: ‘Melly, for God's sake, don't try to be<br> brave. Yell if you want to. There's nobody to hear you but us.’<br><br> As the afternoon wore on, Melanie moaned whether she wanted to be<br> brave or not, and sometimes she screamed. When she did, Scarlett<br> dropped her head into her hands and covered her ears and twisted<br> her body and wished that she herself were dead. Anything was<br> preferable to being a helpless witness to such pain. Anything was<br> better than being tied here waiting for a baby that took such a<br> long time coming. Waiting, when for all she knew the Yankees were<br> actually at Five Points.<br><br> She fervently wished she had paid more attention to the whispered<br> conversations of matrons on the subject of childbirth. If only she<br> had! If only she had been more interested in such matters she'd<br> know whether Melanie was taking a long time or not. She had a<br> vague memory of one of Aunt Pitty's stories of a friend who was in<br> labor for two days and died without ever having the baby. Suppose<br> Melanie should go on like this for two days! But Melanie was so<br> delicate. She couldn't stand two days of this pain. She'd die<br> soon if the baby didn't hurry. And how could she ever face Ashley,<br> if he were still alive, and tell him that Melanie had died--after<br> she had promised to take care of her?<br><br> At first, Melanie wanted to hold Scarlett's hand when the pain was<br> bad but she clamped down on it so hard she nearly broke the bones.<br> After an hour of this, Scarlett's hands were so swollen and bruised<br> she could hardly flex them. She knotted two long towels together<br> and tied them to the foot of the bed and put the knotted end in<br> Melanie's hands. Melanie hung onto it as though it were a life<br> line, straining, pulling it taut, slackening it, tearing it.<br> Throughout the afternoon, her voice went on like an animal dying in<br> a trap. Occasionally she dropped the towel and rubbed her hands<br> feebly and looked up at Scarlett with eyes enormous with pain.<br><br> ‘Talk to me. Please talk to me,’ she whispered and Scarlett would<br> gabble something until Melanie again gripped the knot and again<br> began writhing.<br><br> The dim room swam with heat and pain and droning flies, and time<br> went by on such dragging feet Scarlett could scarcely remember the<br> morning. She felt as if she had been in this steaming, dark,<br> sweating place all her life. She wanted very much to scream every<br> time Melanie did, and only by biting her lips so hard it infuriated<br> her could she restrain herself and drive off hysteria.<br><br> Once Wade came tiptoeing up the stairs and stood outside the door,<br> wailing.<br><br> ‘Wade hungwy!’ Scarlett started to go to him, but Melanie<br> whispered: ‘Don't leave me. Please. I can stand it when you're<br> here.’<br><br> So Scarlett sent Prissy down to warm up the breakfast hominy and<br> feed him. For herself, she felt that she could never eat again<br> after this afternoon.<br><br> The clock on the mantel had stopped and she had no way of telling<br> the time but as the heat in the room lessened and the bright pin<br> points of light grew duller, she pulled the shade aside. She saw<br> to her surprise that it was late afternoon and the sun, a ball of<br> crimson, was far down the sky. Somehow, she had imagined it would<br> remain broiling hot noon forever.<br><br> She wondered passionately what was going on downtown. Had all the<br> troops moved out yet? Had the Yankees come? Would the Confederates<br> march away without even a fight? Then she remembered with a sick<br> dropping in her stomach how few Confederates there were and how many<br> men Sherman had and how well fed they were. Sherman! The name of<br> Satan himself did not frighten her half so much. But there was no<br> time for thinking now, as Melanie called for water, for a cold towel<br> on her head, to be fanned, to have the flies brushed away from her<br> face.<br><br> When twilight came on and Prissy, scurrying like a black wraith,<br> lit a lamp, Melanie became weaker. She began calling for Ashley,<br> over and over, as if in a delirium until the hideous monotony gave<br> Scarlett a fierce desire to smother her voice with a pillow.<br> Perhaps the doctor would come after all. If he would only come<br> quickly! Hope raising its head, she turned to Prissy, and ordered<br> her to run quickly to the Meades' house and see if he were there or<br> Mrs. Meade.<br><br> ‘And if he's not there, ask Mrs. Meade or Cookie what to do. Beg<br> them to come!’<br><br> Prissy was off with a clatter and Scarlett watched her hurrying<br> down the street, going faster than she had ever dreamed the<br> worthless child could move. After a prolonged time she was back,<br> alone.<br><br> ‘De doctah ain' been home all day. Sont wud he mout go off wid de<br> sojers. Miss Scarlett, Mist' Phil's 'ceased.’<br><br> ‘Dead?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm,’ said Prissy, expanding with importance. ‘Talbot, dey<br> coachman, tole me. He wuz shot--’<br><br> ‘Never mind that.’<br><br> ‘Ah din' see Miss Meade. Cookie say Miss Meade she washin' him an'<br> fixin ter buhy him fo' de Yankees gits hyah. Cookie say effen de<br> pain get too bad, jes' you put a knife unner Miss Melly's bed an'<br> it cut de pain in two.’<br><br> Scarlett wanted to slap her again for this helpful information but<br> Melanie opened wide, dilated eyes and whispered: ‘Dear--are the<br> Yankees coming?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Scarlett stoutly. ‘Prissy's a liar.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, Ah sho is,’ Prissy agreed fervently.<br><br> ‘They're coming,’ whispered Melanie undeceived and buried her face<br> in the pillow. Her voice came out muffled.<br><br> ‘My poor baby. My poor baby.’ And, after a long interval: ‘Oh,<br> Scarlett, you mustn't stay here. You must go and take Wade.’<br><br> What Melanie said was no more than Scarlett had been thinking but<br> hearing it put into words infuriated her, shamed her as if her<br> secret cowardice was written plainly in her face.<br><br> ‘Don't be a goose. I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.’<br><br> ‘You might as well. I'm going to die.’ And she began moaning<br> again.<br><br> <br><br> Scarlett came down the dark stairs slowly, like an old woman,<br> feeling her way, clinging to the banisters lest she fall. Her legs<br> were leaden, trembling with fatigue and strain, and she shivered<br> with cold from the clammy sweat that soaked her body. Feebly she<br> made her way onto the front porch and sank down on the top step.<br> She sprawled back against a pillar of the porch and with a shaking<br> hand unbuttoned her basque halfway down her bosom. The night was<br> drenched in warm soft darkness and she lay staring into it, dull as<br> an ox.<br><br> It was all over. Melanie was not dead and the small baby boy who<br> made noises like a young kitten was receiving his first bath at<br> Prissy's hands. Melanie was asleep. How could she sleep after<br> that nightmare of screaming pain and ignorant midwifery that hurt<br> more than it helped? Why wasn't she dead? Scarlett knew that she<br> herself would have died under such handling. But when it was over,<br> Melanie had even whispered, so weakly she had to bend over her to<br> hear: ‘Thank you.’ And then she had gone to sleep. How could she<br> go to sleep? Scarlett forgot that she too had gone to sleep after<br> Wade was born. She forgot everything. Her mind was a vacuum; the<br> world was a vacuum; there had been no life before this endless day<br> and there would be none hereafter--only a heavily hot night, only<br> the sound of her hoarse tired breathing, only the sweat trickling<br> coldly from armpit to waist, from hip to knee, clammy, sticky,<br> chilling.<br><br> She heard her own breath pass from loud evenness to spasmodic<br> sobbing but her eyes were dry and burning as though there would<br> never be tears in them again. Slowly, laboriously, she heaved<br> herself over and pulled her heavy skirts up to her thighs. She was<br> warm and cold and sticky all at the same time and the feel of the<br> night air on her limbs was refreshing. She thought dully what Aunt<br> Pitty would say, if she could see her sprawled here on the front<br> porch with her skirts up and her drawers showing, but she did not<br> care. She did not care about anything. Time had stood still. It<br> might be just after twilight and it might be midnight. She didn't<br> know or care.<br><br> She heard sounds of moving feet upstairs and thought ‘May the Lord<br> damn Prissy,’ before her eyes closed and something like sleep<br> descended upon her. Then after an indeterminate dark interval,<br> Prissy was beside her, chattering on in a pleased way.<br><br> ‘We done right good, Miss Scarlett. Ah specs Maw couldn' a did no<br> better.’<br><br> From the shadows, Scarlett glared at her, too tired to rail, too<br> tired to upbraid, too tired to enumerate Prissy's offenses--her<br> boastful assumption of experience she didn't possess, her fright,<br> her blundering awkwardness, her utter inefficiency when the<br> emergency was hot, the misplacing of the scissors, the spilling of<br> the basin of water on the bed, the dropping of the new born baby.<br> And now she bragged about how good she had been.<br><br> And the Yankees wanted to free the negroes! Well, the Yankees were<br> welcome to them.<br><br> She lay back against the pillar in silence and Prissy, aware of her<br> mood, tiptoed away into the darkness of the porch. After a long<br> interval in which her breathing finally quieted and her mind<br> steadied, Scarlett heard the sound of faint voices from up the<br> road, the tramping of many feet coming from the north. Soldiers!<br> She sat up slowly, pulling down her skirts, although she knew no<br> one could see her in the darkness. As they came abreast the house,<br> an indeterminate number, passing like shadows, she called to them.<br><br> ‘Oh, please!’<br><br> A shadow disengaged itself from the mass and came to the gate.<br><br> ‘Are you going? Are you leaving us?’<br><br> The shadow seemed to take off a hat and a quiet voice came from the<br> darkness.<br><br> ‘Yes, Ma'm. That's what we're doing. We're the last of the men<br> from the breastworks, 'bout a mile north from here.’<br><br> ‘Are you--is the army really retreating?’<br><br> ‘Yes, Ma'm. You see, the Yankees are coming.’<br><br> The Yankees are coming! She had forgotten that. Her throat<br> suddenly contracted and she could say nothing more. The shadow<br> moved away, merged itself with the other shadows and the feet<br> tramped off into the darkness. ‘The Yankees are coming! The<br> Yankees are coming!’ That was what the rhythm of their feet said,<br> that was what her suddenly bumping heart thudded out with each<br> beat. The Yankees are coming!<br><br> ‘De Yankees is comin'!’ bawled Prissy, shrinking close to her.<br> ‘Oh, Miss Scarlett, dey'll kill us all! Dey'll run dey baynits in<br> our stummicks! Dey'll--’<br><br> ‘Oh, hush!’ It was terrifying enough to think these things without<br> hearing them put into trembling words. Renewed fear swept her.<br> What could she do? How could she escape? Where could she turn for<br> help? Every friend had failed her.<br><br> Suddenly she thought of Rhett Butler and calm dispelled her fears.<br> Why hadn't she thought of him this morning when she had been<br> tearing about like a chicken with its head off? She hated him, but<br> he was strong and smart and he wasn't afraid of the Yankees. And<br> he was still in town. Of course, she was mad at him. But she<br> could overlook such things at a time like this. And he had a horse<br> and carriage, too. Oh, why hadn't she thought of him before! He<br> could take them all away from this doomed place, away from the<br> Yankees, somewhere, anywhere.<br><br> She turned to Prissy and spoke with feverish urgency.<br><br> ‘You know where Captain Butler lives--at the Atlanta Hotel?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, but--’<br><br> ‘Well, go there, now, as quick as you can run and tell him I want<br> him. I want him to come quickly and bring his horse and carriage<br> or an ambulance if he can get one. Tell him about the baby. Tell<br> him I want him to take us out of here. Go, now. Hurry!’<br><br> She sat upright and gave Prissy a push to speed her feet.<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty, Miss Scarlett! Ah's sceered ter go runnin' roun' in<br> de dahk by mahseff! Spose de Yankees gits me?’<br><br> ‘If you run fast you can catch up with those soldiers and they<br> won't let the Yankees get you. Hurry!’<br><br> ‘Ah's sceered! Sposin' Cap'n Butler ain' at de hotel?’<br><br> ‘Then ask where he is. Haven't you any gumption? If he isn't at<br> the hotel, go to the barrooms on Decatur Street and ask for him.<br> Go to Belle Watling's house. Hunt for him. You fool, don't you<br> see that if you don't hurry and find him the Yankees will surely<br> get us all?’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, Maw would weah me out wid a cotton stalk, did Ah go<br> in a bahroom or a ho' house.’<br><br> Scarlett pulled herself to her feet.<br><br> ‘Well, I'll wear you out if you don't. You can stand outside in<br> the street and yell for him, can't you? Or ask somebody if he's<br> inside. Get going.’<br><br> When Prissy still lingered, shuffling her feet and mouthing,<br> Scarlett gave her another push which nearly sent her headlong down<br> the front steps.<br><br> ‘You'll go or I'll sell you down the river. You'll never see your<br> mother again or anybody you know and I'll sell you for a field hand<br> too. Hurry!’<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty, Miss Scarlett--’<br><br> But under the determined pressure of her mistress' hand she started<br> down the steps. The front gate clicked and Scarlett cried: ‘Run,<br> you goose!’<br><br> She heard the patter of Prissy's feet as she broke into a trot, and<br> then the sound died away on the soft earth.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXIII<br><br> <br> After Prissy had gone, Scarlett went wearily into the downstairs<br> hall and lit a lamp. The house felt steamingly hot, as though it<br> held in its walls all the heat of the noontide. Some of her<br> dullness was passing now and her stomach was clamoring for food.<br> She remembered she had had nothing to eat since the night before<br> except a spoonful of hominy, and picking up the lamp she went into<br> the kitchen. The fire in the oven had died but the room was<br> stifling hot. She found half a pone of hard corn bread in the<br> skillet and gnawed hungrily on it while she looked about for other<br> food. There was some hominy left in the pot and she ate it with a<br> big cooking spoon, not waiting to put it on a plate. It needed<br> salt badly but she was too hungry to hunt for it. After four<br> spoonfuls of it, the heat of the room was too much and, taking the<br> lamp in one hand and a fragment of pone in the other, she went out<br> into the hall.<br><br> She knew she should go upstairs and sit beside Melanie. If<br> anything went wrong, Melanie would be too weak to call. But the<br> idea of returning to that room where she had spent so many<br> nightmare hours was repulsive to her. Even if Melanie were dying,<br> she couldn't go back up there. She never wanted to see that room<br> again. She set the lamp on the candle stand by the window and<br> returned to the front porch. It was so much cooler here, and even<br> the night was drowned in soft warmth. She sat down on the steps in<br> the circle of faint light thrown by the lamp and continued gnawing<br> on the corn bread.<br><br> When she had finished it, a measure of strength came back to her<br> and with the strength came again the pricking of fear. She could<br> hear a humming of noise far down the street, but what it portended<br> she did not know. She could distinguish nothing but a volume of<br> sound that rose and fell. She strained forward trying to hear and<br> soon she found her muscles aching from the tension. More than<br> anything in the world she yearned to hear the sound of hooves and<br> to see Rhett's careless, self-confident eyes laughing at her fears.<br> Rhett would take them away, somewhere. She didn't know where. She<br> didn't care.<br><br> As she sat straining her ears toward town, a faint glow appeared<br> above the trees. It puzzled her. She watched it and saw it grow<br> brighter. The dark sky became pink and then dull red, and suddenly<br> above the trees, she saw a huge tongue of flame leap high to the<br> heavens. She jumped to her feet, her heart beginning again its<br> sickening thudding and bumping.<br><br> The Yankees had come! She knew they had come and they were burning<br> the town. The flames seemed to be off to the east of the center of<br> town. They shot higher and higher and widened rapidly into a broad<br> expanse of red before her terrified eyes. A whole block must be<br> burning. A faint hot breeze that had sprung up bore the smell of<br> smoke to her.<br><br> She fled up the stairs to her own room and hung out the window for<br> a better view. The sky was a hideous lurid color and great swirls<br> of black smoke went twisting up to hand in billowy clouds above the<br> flames. The smell of smoke was stronger now. Her mind rushed<br> incoherently here and there, thinking how soon the flames would<br> spread up Peachtree Street and burn this house, how soon the<br> Yankees would be rushing in upon her, where she would run, what she<br> would do. All the fiends of hell seemed screaming in her ears and<br> her brain swirled with confusion and panic so overpowering she<br> clung to the window sill for support.<br><br> ‘I must think,’ she told herself over and over. ‘I must think.’<br><br> But thoughts eluded her, darting in and out of her mind like<br> frightened humming birds. As she stood hanging to the sill, a<br> deafening explosion burst on her ears, louder than any cannon she<br> had ever heard. The sky was rent with gigantic flame. Then other<br> explosions. The earth shook and the glass in the panes above her<br> head shivered and came down around her.<br><br> The world became an inferno of noise and flame and trembling earth<br> as one explosion followed another in earsplitting succession.<br> Torrents of sparks shot to the sky and descended slowly, lazily,<br> through blood-colored clouds of smoke. She thought she heard a<br> feeble call from the next room but she paid it no heed. She had no<br> time for Melanie now. No time for anything except a fear that<br> licked through her veins as swiftly as the flames she saw. She was<br> a child and mad with fright and she wanted to bury her head in her<br> mother's lap and shut out this sight. If she were only home! Home<br> with Mother.<br><br> Through the nerve-shivering sounds, she heard another sound, that<br> of fear-sped feet coming up the stairs three at a time, heard a<br> voice yelping like a lost hound. Prissy broke into the room and,<br> flying to Scarlett, clutched her arm in a grip that seemed to pinch<br> out pieces of flesh.<br><br> ‘The Yankees--’ cried Scarlett.<br><br> ‘No'm, its our gempmums!’ yelled Prissy between breaths, digging<br> her nails deeper into Scarlett's arm. ‘Dey's buhnin' de foun'ry<br> an' de ahmy supply depots an' de wa'houses an', fo' Gawd, Miss<br> Scarlett, dey done set off dem sebenty freight cahs of cannon balls<br> an' gunpowder an', Jesus, we's all gwine ter buhn up!’<br><br> She began yelping again shrilly and pinched Scarlett so hard she<br> cried out in pain and fury and shook off her hand.<br><br> The Yankees hadn't come yet! There was still time to get away!<br> She rallied her frightened forces together.<br><br> ‘If I don't get a hold on myself,’ she thought, ‘I'll be squalling<br> like a scalded cat!’ and the sight of Prissy's abject terror helped<br> steady her. She took her by the shoulders and shook her.<br><br> ‘Shut up that racket and talk sense. The Yankees haven't come, you<br> fool! Did you see Captain Butler? What did he say? Is he<br> coming?’<br><br> Prissy ceased her yelling but her teeth chattered.<br><br> ‘Yas'm, ah finely foun' him. In a bahroom, lak you told me. He--’<br><br> ‘Never mind where you found him. Is he coming? Did you tell him<br> to bring his horse?’<br><br> ‘Lawd, Miss Scarlett, he say our gempmums done tuck his hawse an'<br> cah'ige fer a amberlance.’<br><br> ‘Dear God in Heaven!’<br><br> ‘But he comin'--’<br><br> ‘What did he say?’<br><br> Prissy had recovered her breath and a small measure of control but<br> her eyes still rolled.<br><br> ‘Well'm, lak you tole me, Ah foun' him in a bahroom. Ah stood<br> outside an' yell fer him an' he come out. An' terreckly he see me<br> an' Ah starts tell him, de sojers tech off a sto' house down<br> Decatur Street an' it flame up an' he say Come on an' he grab me<br> an' we runs ter Fibe Points an' he say den: What now? Talk fas'.<br> An' Ah say you say, Cap'n Butler, come quick an' bring yo' hawse<br> an' cah'ige. Miss Melly done had a chile an' you is bustin' ter<br> get outer town. An' he say: Where all she studyin' 'bout goin'?<br> An' Ah say: Ah doan know, suh, but you is boun' ter go fo' de<br> Yankees gits hyah an' wants him ter go wid you. An' he laugh an'<br> say dey done tuck his hawse.’<br><br> Scarlett's heart went leaden as the last hope left her. Fool that<br> she was, why hadn't she thought that the retreating army would<br> naturally take every vehicle and animal left in the city? For a<br> moment she was too stunned to hear what Prissy was saying but she<br> pulled herself together to hear the rest of the story.<br><br> ‘An' den he say, Tell Miss Scarlett ter res' easy. Ah'll steal her<br> a hawse outer de ahmy crall effen dey's ary one lef. An' he say,<br> Ah done stole hawses befo' dis night. Tell her Ah git her a hawse<br> effen Ah gits shot fer it. Den he laugh agin an' say, Cut an' run<br> home. An' befo' Ah gits started Ker-bboom! Off goes a noise an'<br> Ah lak ter drap in mah tracks an' he tell me twain't nuthin' but de<br> ammernition our gempmums blown' up so's de Yankees don't git it<br> an'--’<br><br> ‘He is coming? He's going to bring a horse?’<br><br> ‘So he say.’<br><br> She drew a long breath of relief. If there was any way of getting<br> a horse, Rhett Butler would get one. A smart man, Rhett. She<br> would forgive him anything if he got them out of this mess.<br> Escape! And with Rhett she would have no fear. Rhett would<br> protect them. Thank God for Rhett! With safety in view she turned<br> practical.<br><br> ‘Wake Wade up and dress him and pack some clothes for all of us.<br> Put them in the small trunk. And don't tell Miss Mellie we're<br> going. Not yet. But wrap the baby in a couple of thick towels and<br> be sure and pack his clothes.’<br><br> Prissy still clung to her skirts and hardly anything showed in her<br> eyes except the whites. Scarlett gave her a shove and loosened her<br> grip.<br><br> ‘Hurry,’ she cried, and Prissy went off like a rabbit.<br><br> Scarlett knew she should go in and quiet Melanie's fear, knew<br> Melanie must be frightened out of her senses by the thunderous<br> noises that continued unabated and the glare that lighted the sky.<br> It looked and sounded like the end of the world.<br><br> But she could not bring herself to go back into that room just yet.<br> She ran down the stairs with some idea of packing up Miss<br> Pittypat's china and the little silver she had left when she<br> refugeed to Macon. But when she reached the dining room, her hands<br> were shaking so badly she dropped three plates and shattered them.<br> She ran out onto the porch to listen and back again to the dining<br> room and dropped the silver clattering to the floor. Everything<br> she touched she dropped. In her hurry she slipped on the rag rug<br> and fell to the floor with a jolt but leaped up so quickly she was<br> not even aware of the pain. Upstairs she could hear Prissy<br> galloping about like a wild animal and the sound maddened her, for<br> she was galloping just as aimlessly.<br><br> For the dozenth time, she ran out onto the porch but this time she<br> did not go back to her futile packing. She sat down. It was just<br> impossible to pack anything. Impossible to do anything but sit<br> with hammering heart and wait for Rhett. It seemed hours before he<br> came. At last, far up the road, she heard the protesting screech<br> of unoiled axles and the slow uncertain plodding of hooves. Why<br> didn't he hurry? Why didn't he make the horse trot?<br><br> The sounds came nearer and she leaped to her feet and called<br> Rhett's name. Then, she saw him dimly as he climbed down from the<br> seat of a small wagon, heard the clicking of the gate as he came<br> toward her. He came into view and the light of the lamp showed him<br> plainly. His dress was as debonaire as if he were going to a ball,<br> well-tailored white linen coat and trousers, embroidered gray<br> watered-silk waistcoat and a hint of ruffle on his shirt bosom.<br> His wide Panama hat was set dashingly on one side of his head and<br> in the belt of his trousers were thrust two ivory-handled, long-<br> barreled dueling pistols. The pockets of his coat sagged heavily<br> with ammunition.<br><br> He came up the walk with the springy stride of a savage and his<br> fine head was carried like a pagan prince. The dangers of the<br> night which had driven Scarlett into panic had affected him like an<br> intoxicant. There was a carefully restrained ferocity in his dark<br> face, a ruthlessness which would have frightened her had she the<br> wits to see it.<br><br> His black eyes danced as though amused by the whole affair, as<br> though the earth-splitting sounds and the horrid glare were merely<br> things to frighten children. She swayed toward him as he came up<br> the steps, her face white, her green eyes burning.<br><br> ‘Good evening,’ he said, in his drawling voice, as he removed his<br> hat with a sweeping gesture. ‘Fine weather we're having. I hear<br> you're going to take a trip.’<br><br> ‘If you make any jokes, I shall never speak to you again,’ she said<br> with quivering voice.<br><br> ‘Don't tell me you are frightened!’ He pretended to be surprised<br> and smiled in a way that made her long to push him backwards down<br> the steep steps.<br><br> ‘Yes, I am! I'm frightened to death and if you had the sense God<br> gave a goat, you'd be frightened too. But we haven't got time to<br> talk. We must get out of here.’<br><br> ‘At your service, Madam. But just where were you figuring on<br> going? I made the trip out here for curiosity, just to see where<br> you were intending to go. You can't go north or east or south or<br> west. The Yankees are all around. There's just one road out of<br> town which the Yankees haven't got yet and the army is retreating<br> by that road. And that road won't be open long. General Steve<br> Lee's cavalry is fighting a rear-guard action at Rough and Ready to<br> hold it open long enough for the army to get away. If you follow<br> the army down the McDonough road, they'll take the horse away from<br> you and, while it's not much of a horse, I did go to a lot of<br> trouble stealing it. Just where are you going?’<br><br> She stood shaking, listening to his words, hardly hearing them.<br> But, at his question she suddenly knew where she was going, knew<br> that all this miserable day she had known where she was going. The<br> only place.<br><br> ‘I'm going home,’ she said.<br><br> ‘Home? You mean to Tara?’<br><br> ‘Yes, yes! To Tara! Oh, Rhett, we must hurry!’<br><br> He looked at her as if she had lost her mind.<br><br> ‘Tara? God Almighty, Scarlett! Don't you know they fought all day<br> at Jonesboro? Fought for ten miles up and down the road from Rough<br> and Ready even into the streets of Jonesboro? The Yankees may be<br> all over Tara by now, all over the County. Nobody knows where they<br> are but they're in that neighborhood. You can't go home! You<br> can't go right through the Yankee army!’<br><br> ‘I will go home!’ she cried. ‘I will! I will!’<br><br> ‘You little fool,’ and his voice was swift and rough. ‘You can't<br> go that way. Even if you didn't run into the Yankees, the woods<br> are full of stragglers and deserters from both armies. And lots of<br> our troops are still retreating from Jonesboro. They'd take the<br> horse away from you as quickly as the Yankees would. Your only<br> chance is to follow the troops down the McDonough road and pray<br> that they won't see you in the dark. You can't go to Tara. Even<br> if you got there, you'd probably find it burned down. I won't let<br> you go home. It's insanity.’<br><br> ‘I will go home!’ she cried and her voice broke and rose to a<br> scream. ‘I will go home! You can't stop me! I will go home! I<br> want my mother! I'll kill you if you try to stop me! I will go<br> home!’<br><br> Tears of fright and hysteria streamed down her face as she finally<br> gave way under the long strain. She beat on his chest with her<br> fists and screamed again: ‘I will! I will! If I have to walk<br> every step of the way!’<br><br> Suddenly she was in his arms, her wet cheek against the starched<br> ruffle of his shirt, her beating hands stilled against him. His<br> hands caressed her tumbled hair gently, soothingly, and his voice<br> was gentle too. So gentle, so quiet, so devoid of mockery, it did<br> not seem Rhett Butler's voice at all but the voice of some kind<br> strong stranger who smelled of brandy and tobacco and horses,<br> comforting smells because they reminded her of Gerald.<br><br> ‘There, there, darling,’ he said softly. ‘Don't cry. You shall go<br> home, my brave little girl. You shall go home. Don't cry.’<br><br> She felt something brush her hair and wondered vaguely through her<br> tumult if it were his lips. He was so tender, so infinitely<br> soothing, she longed to stay in his arms forever. With such strong<br> arms about her, surely nothing could harm her.<br><br> He fumbled in his pocket and produced a handkerchief and wiped her<br> eyes.<br><br> ‘Now, blow your nose like a good child,’ he ordered, a glint of a<br> smile in his eyes, ‘and tell me what to do. We must work fast.’<br><br> She blew her nose obediently, still trembling, but she could not<br> think what to tell him to do. Seeing how her lip quivered and her<br> eyes looked up at him helplessly, he took command.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Wilkes has had her child? It will be dangerous to move her--<br> dangerous to drive her twenty-five miles in that rickety wagon.<br> We'd better leave her with Mrs. Meade.’<br><br> ‘The Meades aren't home. I can't leave her.’<br><br> ‘Very well. Into the wagon she goes. Where is that simple-minded<br> little wench?’<br><br> ‘Upstairs packing the trunk.’<br><br> ‘Trunk? You can't take any trunk in that wagon. It's almost too<br> small to hold all of you and the wheels are ready to come off with<br> no encouragement. Call her and tell her to get the smallest<br> feather bed in the house and put it in the wagon.’<br><br> Still Scarlett could not move. He took her arm in a strong grasp<br> and some of the vitality which animated him seemed to flow into her<br> body. If only she could be as cool and casual as he was! He<br> propelled her into the hall but she still stood helplessly looking<br> at him. His lip went down mockingly: ‘Can this be the heroic<br> young woman who assured me she feared neither God nor man?’<br><br> He suddenly burst into laughter and dropped her arm. Stung, she<br> glared at him, hating him.<br><br> ‘I'm not afraid,’ she said.<br><br> ‘Yes, you are. In another moment you'll be in a swoon and I have<br> no smelling salts about me.’<br><br> She stamped her foot impotently because she could not think of<br> anything else to do--and without a word picked up the lamp and<br> started up the stairs. He was close behind her and she could hear<br> him laughing softly to himself. That sound stiffened her spine.<br> She went into Wade's nursery and found him sitting clutched in<br> Prissy's arms, half dressed, hiccoughing quietly. Prissy was<br> whimpering. The feather tick on Wade's bed was small and she<br> ordered Prissy to drag it down the stairs and into the wagon.<br> Prissy put down the child and obeyed. Wade followed her down the<br> stairs, his hiccoughs stilled by his interest in the proceedings.<br><br> ‘Come,’ said Scarlett, turning to Melanie's door and Rhett followed<br> her, hat in hand.<br><br> Melanie lay quietly with the sheet up to her chin. Her face was<br> deathly white but her eyes, sunken and black circled, were serene.<br> She showed no surprise at the sight of Rhett in her bedroom but<br> seemed to take it as a matter of course. She tried to smile weakly<br> but the smile died before it reached the corners of her mouth.<br><br> ‘We are going home, to Tara,’ Scarlett explained rapidly. ‘The<br> Yankees are coming. Rhett is going to take us. It's the only way,<br> Melly.’<br><br> Melanie tried to nod her head feebly and gestured toward the baby.<br> Scarlett picked up the small baby and wrapped him hastily in a<br> thick towel. Rhett stepped to the bed.<br><br> ‘I'll try not to hurt you,’ he said quietly, tucking the sheet<br> about her. ‘See if you can put your arms around my neck.’<br><br> Melanie tried but they fell back weakly. He bent, slipped an arm<br> under her shoulders and another across her knees and lifted her<br> gently. She did not cry out but Scarlett saw her bite her lip and<br> go even whiter. Scarlett held the lamp high for Rhett to see and<br> started toward the door when Melanie made a feeble gesture toward<br> the wall.<br><br> ‘What is it?’ Rhett asked softly.<br><br> ‘Please,’ Melanie whispered, trying to point. ‘Charles.’<br><br> Rhett looked down at her as if he thought her delirious but<br> Scarlett understood and was irritated. She knew Melanie wanted the<br> daguerreotype of Charles which hung on the wall below his sword and<br> pistol.<br><br> ‘Please,’ Melanie whispered again, ‘the sword.’<br><br> ‘Oh, all right,’ said Scarlett and, after she had lighted Rhett's<br> careful way down the steps, she went back and unhooked the sword<br> and pistol belts. It would be awkward, carrying them as well as<br> the baby and the lamp. That was just like Melanie, not to be at<br> all bothered over nearly dying and having the Yankees at her heels<br> but to worry about Charles' things.<br><br> As she took down the daguerreotype, she caught a glimpse of<br> Charles' face. His large brown eyes met hers and she stopped for a<br> moment to look at the picture curiously. This man had been her<br> husband, had lain beside her for a few nights, had given her a<br> child with eyes as soft and brown as his. And she could hardly<br> remember him.<br><br> The child in her arms waved small fists and mewed softly and she<br> looked down at him. For the first time, she realized that this was<br> Ashley's baby and suddenly wished with all the strength left in her<br> that he were her baby, hers and Ashley's.<br><br> Prissy came bounding up the stairs and Scarlett handed the child to<br> her. They went hastily down, the lamp throwing uncertain shadows<br> on the wall. In the hall, Scarlett saw a bonnet and put it on<br> hurriedly, tying the ribbons under her chin. It was Melanie's<br> black mourning bonnet and it did not fit Scarlett's head but she<br> could not recall where she had put her own bonnet.<br><br> She went out of the house and down the front steps, carrying the<br> lamp and trying to keep the saber from banging against her legs.<br> Melanie lay full length in the back of the wagon, and, beside her,<br> were Wade and the towel-swathed baby. Prissy climbed in and took<br> the baby in her arms.<br><br> The wagon was very small and the boards about the sides very low.<br> The wheels leaned inward as if their first revolution would make<br> them come off. She took one look at the horse and her heart sank.<br> He was a small emaciated animal and he stood with his head<br> dispiritedly low, almost between his forelegs. His back was raw<br> with sores and harness galls and he breathed as no sound horse<br> should.<br><br> ‘Not much of an animal, is it?’ grinned Rhett. ‘Looks like he'll<br> die in the shafts. But he's the best I could do. Some day I'll<br> tell you with embellishments just where and how I stole him and how<br> narrowly I missed getting shot. Nothing but my devotion to you<br> would make me, at this stage of my career, turn horse thief--and<br> thief of such a horse. Let me help you in.’<br><br> He took the lamp from her and set it on the ground. The front seat<br> was only a narrow plank across the sides of the wagon. Rhett<br> picked Scarlett up bodily and swung her to it. How wonderful to be<br> a man and as strong as Rhett, she thought, tucking her wide skirts<br> about her. With Rhett beside her, she did not fear anything,<br> neither the fire nor the noise nor the Yankees.<br><br> He climbed onto the seat beside her and picked up the reins.<br><br> ‘Oh, wait!’ she cried. ‘I forgot to lock the front door.’<br><br> He burst into a roar of laughter and slapped the reins upon the<br> horse's back.<br><br> ‘What are you laughing at?’<br><br> ‘At you--locking the Yankees out,’ he said and the horse started<br> off, slowly, reluctantly. The lamp on the sidewalk burned on,<br> making a tiny yellow circle of light which grew smaller and smaller<br> as they moved away.<br><br> <br><br> Rhett turned the horse's slow feet westward from Peachtree and the<br> wobbling wagon jounced into the rutty lane with a violence that<br> wrenched an abruptly stifled moan from Melanie. Dark trees<br> interlaced above their heads, dark silent houses loomed up on<br> either side and the white palings of fences gleamed faintly like a<br> row of tombstones. The narrow street was a dim tunnel, but faintly<br> through the thick leafy ceiling the hideous red glow of the sky<br> penetrated and shadows chased one another down the dark way like<br> mad ghosts. The smell of smoke came stronger and stronger, and on<br> the wings of the hot breeze came a pandemonium of sound from the<br> center of town, yells, the dull rumbling of heavy army wagons and<br> the steady tramp of marching feet. As Rhett jerked the horse's<br> head and turned him into another street, another deafening<br> explosion tore the air and a monstrous skyrocket of flame and smoke<br> shot up in the west.<br><br> ‘That must be the last of the ammunition trains,’ Rhett said<br> calmly. ‘Why didn't they get them out this morning, the fools!<br> There was plenty of time. Well, too bad for us. I thought by<br> circling around the center of town, we might avoid the fire and<br> that drunken mob on Decatur Street and get through to the southwest<br> part of town without any danger. But we've got to cross Marietta<br> Street somewhere and that explosion was near Marietta Street or I<br> miss my guess.’<br><br> ‘Must--must we go through the fire?’ Scarlett quavered.<br><br> ‘Not if we hurry,’ said Rhett and, springing from the wagon, he<br> disappeared into the darkness of a yard. When he returned he had a<br> small limb of a tree in his hand and he laid it mercilessly across<br> the horse's galled back. The animal broke into a shambling trot,<br> his breath panting and labored, and the wagon swayed forward with a<br> jolt that threw them about like popcorn in a popper. The baby<br> wailed, and Prissy and Wade cried out as they bruised themselves<br> against the sides of the wagon. But from Melanie there was no<br> sound.<br><br> As they neared Marietta Street, the trees thinned out and the tall<br> flames roaring up above the buildings threw street and houses into<br> a glare of light brighter than day, casting monstrous shadows that<br> twisted as wildly as torn sails flapping in a gale on a sinking<br> ship.<br><br> Scarlett's teeth chattered but so great was her terror she was not<br> even aware of it. She was cold and she shivered, even though the<br> heat of the flames was already hot against their faces. This was<br> hell and she was in it and, if she could only have conquered her<br> shaking knees, she would have leaped from the wagon and run<br> screaming back the dark road they had come, back to the refuge of<br> Miss Pittypat's house. She shrank closer to Rhett, took his arm in<br> fingers that trembled and looked up at him for words, for comfort,<br> for something reassuring. In the unholy crimson glow that bathed<br> them, his dark profile stood out as clearly as the head on an<br> ancient coin, beautiful, cruel and decadent. At her touch he<br> turned to her, his eyes gleaming with a light as frightening as the<br> fire. To Scarlett, he seemed as exhilarated and contemptuous as if<br> he got strong pleasure from the situation, as if he welcomed the<br> inferno they were approaching.<br><br> ‘Here,’ he said, laying a hand on one of the long-barreled pistols<br> in his belt. ‘If anyone, black or white, comes up on your side of<br> the wagon and tries to lay hand on the horse, shoot him and we'll<br> ask questions later. But for God's sake, don't shoot the nag in<br> your excitement.’<br><br> ‘I--I have a pistol,’ she whispered, clutching the weapon in her<br> lap, perfectly certain that if death stared her in the face, she<br> would be too frightened to pull the trigger.<br><br> ‘You have? Where did you get it?’<br><br> ‘It's Charles'.’<br><br> ‘Charles?’<br><br> ‘Yes, Charles--my husband.’<br><br> ‘Did you ever really have a husband, my dear?’ he whispered and<br> laughed softly.<br><br> If he would only be serious! If he would only hurry!<br><br> ‘How do you suppose I got my boy?’ she cried fiercely.<br><br> ‘Oh, there are other ways than husbands--’<br><br> ‘Will you hush and hurry?’<br><br> But he drew rein abruptly, almost at Marietta Street, in the shadow<br> of a warehouse not yet touched by the flames.<br><br> ‘Hurry!’ It was the only word in her mind. Hurry! Hurry!<br><br> ‘Soldiers,’ he said.<br><br> The detachment came down Marietta Street, between the burning<br> buildings, walking at route step, tiredly, rifles held any way,<br> heads down, too weary to hurry, too weary to care if timbers were<br> crashing to right and left and smoke billowing about them. They<br> were all ragged, so ragged that between officers and men there were<br> no distinguishing insignia except here and there a torn hat brim<br> pinned up with a wreathed ‘C.S.A.’ Many were barefooted and here<br> and there a dirty bandage wrapped a head or arm. They went past,<br> looking neither to left nor right, so silent that had it not been<br> for the steady tramp of feet they might all have been ghosts.<br><br> ‘Take a good look at them,’ came Rhett's gibing voice, ‘so you can<br> tell your grandchildren you saw the rear guard of the Glorious<br> Cause in retreat.’<br><br> Suddenly she hated him, hated him with a strength that momentarily<br> overpowered her fear, made it seem petty and small. She knew her<br> safety and that of the others in the back of the wagon depended on<br> him and him alone, but she hated him for his sneering at those<br> ragged ranks. She thought of Charles who was dead and Ashley who<br> might be dead and all the gay and gallant young men who were<br> rotting in shallow graves and she forgot that she, too, had once<br> thought them fools. She could not speak, but hatred and disgust<br> burned in her eyes as she stared at him fiercely.<br><br> As the last of the soldiers were passing, a small figure in the<br> rear rank, his rifle butt dragging the ground, wavered, stopped and<br> stared after the others with a dirty face so dulled by fatigue he<br> looked like a sleepwalker. He was as small as Scarlett, so small<br> his rifle was almost as tall as he was, and his grime-smeared face<br> was unbearded. Sixteen at the most, thought Scarlett irrelevantly,<br> must be one of the Home Guard or a runaway schoolboy.<br><br> As she watched, the boy's knees buckled slowly and he went down in<br> the dust. Without a word, two men fell out of the last rank and<br> walked back to him. One, a tall spare man with a black beard that<br> hung to his belt, silently handed his own rifle and that of the boy<br> to the other. Then, stooping, he jerked the boy to his shoulders<br> with an ease that looked like sleight of hand. He started off<br> slowly after the retreating column, his shoulders bowed under the<br> weight, while the boy, weak, infuriated like a child teased by its<br> elders, screamed out: ‘Put me down, damn you! Put me down! I can<br> walk!’<br><br> The bearded man said nothing and plodded on out of sight around the<br> bend of the road.<br><br> Rhett sat still, the reins lax in his hands, looking after them, a<br> curious moody look on his swarthy face. Then, there was a crash of<br> falling timbers near by and Scarlett saw a thin tongue of flame<br> lick up over the roof of the warehouse in whose sheltering shadow<br> they sat. Then pennons and battle flags of flame flared<br> triumphantly to the sky above them. Smoke burnt her nostrils and<br> Wade and Prissy began coughing. The baby made soft sneezing<br> sounds.<br><br> ‘Oh, name of God, Rhett! Are you crazy? Hurry! Hurry!’<br><br> Rhett made no reply but brought the tree limb down on the horse's<br> back with a cruel force that made the animal leap forward. With<br> all the speed the horse could summon, they jolted and bounced<br> across Marietta Street. Ahead of them was a tunnel of fire where<br> buildings were blazing on either side of the short, narrow street<br> that led down to the railroad tracks. They plunged into it. A<br> glare brighter than a dozen suns dazzled their eyes, scorching heat<br> seared their skins and the roaring, cracking and crashing beat upon<br> their ears in painful waves. For an eternity, it seemed, they were<br> in the midst of flaming torment and then abruptly they were in<br> semidarkness again.<br><br> As they dashed down the street and bumped over the railroad tracks,<br> Rhett applied the whip automatically. His face looked set and<br> absent, as though he had forgotten where he was. His broad<br> shoulders were hunched forward and his chin jutted out as though<br> the thoughts in his mind were not pleasant. The heat of the fire<br> made sweat stream down his forehead and cheeks but he did not wipe<br> it off.<br><br> They pulled into a side street, then another, then turned and<br> twisted from one narrow street to another until Scarlett completely<br> lost her bearings and the roaring of the flames died behind them.<br> Still Rhett did not speak. He only laid on the whip with<br> regularity. The red glow in the sky was fading now and the road<br> became so dark, so frightening, Scarlett would have welcomed words,<br> any words from him, even jeering, insulting words, words that cut.<br> But he did not speak.<br><br> Silent or not, she thanked Heaven for the comfort of his presence.<br> It was so good to have a man beside her, to lean close to him and<br> feel the hard swell of his arm and know that he stood between her<br> and unnamable terrors, even though he merely sat there and stared.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett,’ she whispered clasping his arm, ‘What would we ever<br> have done without you? I'm so glad you aren't in the army!’<br><br> He turned his head and gave her one look, a look that made her drop<br> his arm and shrink back. There was no mockery in his eyes now.<br> They were naked and there was anger and something like bewilderment<br> in them. His lip curled down and he turned his head away. For a<br> long time they jounced along in a silence unbroken except for the<br> faint wails of the baby and sniffles from Prissy. When she was<br> able to bear the sniffling noise no longer, Scarlett turned and<br> pinched her viciously, causing Prissy to scream in good earnest<br> before she relapsed into frightened silence.<br><br> Finally Rhett turned the horse at right angles and after a while<br> they were on a wider, smoother road. The dim shapes of houses grew<br> farther and farther apart and unbroken woods loomed wall-like on<br> either side.<br><br> ‘We're out of town now,’ said Rhett briefly, drawing rein, ‘and on<br> the main road to Rough and Ready.’<br><br> ‘Hurry. Don't stop!’<br><br> ‘Let the animal breathe a bit.’ Then turning to her, he asked<br> slowly: ‘Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy<br> thing?’<br><br> ‘Do what?’<br><br> ‘Do you still want to try to get through to Tara? It's suicidal.<br> Steve Lee's cavalry and the Yankee Army are between you and Tara.’<br><br> Oh, Dear God! Was he going to refuse to take her home, after all<br> she'd gone through this terrible day?<br><br> ‘Oh, yes! Yes! Please, Rhett, let's hurry. The horse isn't<br> tired.’<br><br> ‘Just a minute. You can't go down to Jonesboro on this road. You<br> can't follow the train tracks. They've been fighting up and down<br> there all day from Rough and Ready on south. Do you know any other<br> roads, small wagon roads or lanes that don't go through Rough and<br> Ready or Jonesboro?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes,’ cried Scarlett in relief. ‘If we can just get near to<br> Rough and Ready, I know a wagon trace that winds off from the main<br> Jonesboro road and wanders around for miles. Pa and I used to ride<br> it. It comes out right near the MacIntosh place and that's only a<br> mile from Tara.’<br><br> ‘Good. Maybe you can get past Rough and Ready all right. General<br> Steve Lee was there during the afternoon covering the retreat.<br> Maybe the Yankees aren't there yet. Maybe you can get through<br> there, if Steve Lee's men don't pick up your horse.’<br><br> ‘_I_ can get through?’<br><br> ‘Yes, YOU.’ His voice was rough.<br><br> ‘But Rhett-- You-- Aren't going to take us?’<br><br> ‘No. I'm leaving you here.’<br><br> She looked around wildly, at the livid sky behind them, at the dark<br> trees on either hand hemming them in like a prison wall, at the<br> frightened figures in the back of the wagon--and finally at him.<br> Had she gone crazy? Was she not hearing right?<br><br> He was grinning now. She could just see his white teeth in the<br> faint light and the old mockery was back in his eyes.<br><br> ‘Leaving us? Where--where are you going?’<br><br> ‘I am going, dear girl, with the army.’<br><br> She sighed with relief and irritation. Why did he joke at this<br> time of all times? Rhett in the army! After all he'd said about<br> stupid fools who were enticed into losing their lives by a roll of<br> drums and brave words from orators--fools who killed themselves<br> that wise men might make money!<br><br> ‘Oh, I could choke you for scaring me so! Let's get on.’<br><br> ‘I'm not joking, my dear. And I am hurt, Scarlett, that you do not<br> take my gallant sacrifice with better spirit. Where is your<br> patriotism, your love for Our Glorious Cause? Now is your chance<br> to tell me to return with my shield or on it. But, talk fast, for<br> I want time to make a brave speech before departing for the wars.’<br><br> His drawling voice gibed in her ears. He was jeering at her and,<br> somehow, she knew he was jeering at himself too. What was he<br> talking about? Patriotism, shields, brave speeches? It wasn't<br> possible that he meant what he was saying. It just wasn't<br> believable that he could talk so blithely of leaving her here on<br> this dark road with a woman who might be dying, a new-born infant,<br> a foolish black wench and a frightened child, leaving her to pilot<br> them through miles of battle fields and stragglers and Yankees and<br> fire and God knows what.<br><br> Once, when she was six years old, she had fallen from a tree, flat<br> on her stomach. She could still recall that sickening interval<br> before breath came back into her body. Now, as she looked at<br> Rhett, she felt the same way she had felt then, breathless,<br> stunned, nauseated.<br><br> ‘Rhett, you are joking!’<br><br> She grabbed his arm and felt her tears of fright splash down her<br> wrist. He raised her hand and kissed it arily.<br><br> ‘Selfish to the end, aren't you, my dear? Thinking only of your<br> own precious hide and not of the gallant Confederacy. Think how<br> our troops will be heartened by my eleventh-hour appearance.’<br> There was a malicious tenderness in his voice.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett,’ she wailed, ‘how can you do this to me? Why are you<br> leaving me?’<br><br> ‘Why?’ he laughed jauntily. ‘Because, perhaps, of the betraying<br> sentimentality that lurks in all of us Southerners. Perhaps--<br> perhaps because I am ashamed. Who knows?’<br><br> ‘Ashamed? You should die of shame. To desert us here, alone,<br> helpless--’<br><br> ‘Dear Scarlett! You aren't helpless. Anyone as selfish and<br> determined as you are is never helpless. God help the Yankees if<br> they should get you.’<br><br> He stepped abruptly down from the wagon and, as she watched him,<br> stunned with bewilderment, he came around to her side of the wagon.<br><br> ‘Get out,’ he ordered.<br><br> She stared at him. He reached up roughly, caught her under the<br> arms and swung her to the ground beside him. With a tight grip on<br> her he dragged her several paces away from the wagon. She felt the<br> dust and gravel in her slippers hurting her feet. The still hot<br> darkness wrapped her like a dream.<br><br> ‘I'm not asking you to understand or forgive. I don't give a damn<br> whether you do either, for I shall never understand or forgive<br> myself for this idiocy. I am annoyed at myself to find that so<br> much quixoticism still lingers in me. But our fair Southland needs<br> every man. Didn't our brave Governor Brown say just that? Not<br> matter. I'm off to the wars.’ He laughed suddenly, a ringing,<br> free laugh that startled the echoes in the dark woods.<br><br> ‘'I could not love thee, Dear, so much, loved I not Honour more.'<br> That's a pat speech, isn't it? Certainly better than anything I<br> can think up myself, at the present moment. For I do love you,<br> Scarlett, in spite of what I said that night on the porch last<br> month.’<br><br> His drawl was caressing and his hands slid up her bare arms, warm<br> strong hands. ‘I love you, Scarlett, because we are so much alike,<br> renegades, both of us, dear, and selfish rascals. Neither of us<br> cares a rap if the whole world goes to pot, so long as we are safe<br> and comfortable.’<br><br> His voice went on in the darkness and she heard words, but they<br> made no sense to her. Her mind was tiredly trying to take in the<br> harsh truth that he was leaving her here to face the Yankees alone.<br> Her mind said: ‘He's leaving me. He's leaving me.’ But no<br> emotion stirred.<br><br> Then his arms went around her waist and shoulders and she felt the<br> hard muscles of his thighs against her body and the buttons of his<br> coat pressing into her breast. A warm tide of feeling, bewildering,<br> frightening, swept over her, carrying out of her mind the time and<br> place and circumstances. She felt as limp as a rag doll, warm, weak<br> and helpless, and his supporting arms were so pleasant.<br><br> ‘You don't want to change your mind about what I said last month?<br> There's nothing like danger and death to give an added fillip. Be<br> patriotic, Scarlett. Think how you would be sending a soldier to<br> his death with beautiful memories.’<br><br> He was kissing her now and his mustache tickled her mouth, kissing<br> her with slow, hot lips that were so leisurely as though he had the<br> whole night before him. Charles had never kissed her like this.<br> Never had the kisses of the Tarleton and Calvert boys made her go<br> hot and cold and shaky like this. He bent her body backward and<br> his lips traveled down her throat to where the cameo fastened her<br> basque.<br><br> ‘Sweet,’ he whispered. ‘Sweet.’<br><br> She saw the wagon dimly in the dark and heard the treble piping of<br> Wade's voice.<br><br> ‘Muvver! Wade fwightened!’<br><br> Into her swaying, darkened mind, cold sanity came back with a rush<br> and she remembered what she had forgotten for the moment--that she<br> was frightened too, and Rhett was leaving her, leaving her, the<br> damned cad. And on top of it all, he had the consummate gall to<br> stand here in the road and insult her with his infamous proposals.<br> Rage and hate flowed into her and stiffened her spine and with one<br> wrench she tore herself loose from his arms.<br><br> ‘Oh, you cad!’ she cried and her mind leaped about, trying to think<br> of worse things to call him, things she had heard Gerald call Mr.<br> Lincoln, the MacIntoshes and balky mules, but the words would not<br> come. ‘You low-down, cowardly, nasty, stinking thing!’ And<br> because she could not think of anything crushing enough, she drew<br> back her arm and slapped him across the mouth with all the force<br> she had left. He took a step backward, his hand going to his face.<br><br> ‘Ah,’ he said quietly and for a moment they stood facing each other<br> in the darkness. Scarlett could hear his heavy breathing, and her<br> own breath came in gasps as if she had been running hard.<br><br> ‘They were right! Everybody was right! You aren't a gentleman!’<br><br> ‘My dear girl,’ he said, ‘how inadequate.’<br><br> She knew he was laughing and the thought goaded her.<br><br> ‘Go on! Go on now! I want you to hurry. I don't want to ever see<br> you again. I hope a cannon ball lands right on you. I hope it<br> blows you to a million pieces. I--’<br><br> ‘Never mind the rest. I follow your general idea. When I'm dead<br> on the altar of my country, I hope your conscience hurts you.’<br><br> She heard him laugh as he turned away and walked back toward the<br> wagon. She saw him stand beside it, heard him speak and his voice<br> was changed, courteous and respectful as it always was when he<br> spoke to Melanie.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Wilkes?’<br><br> Prissy's frightened voice made answer from the wagon.<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty, Cap'n Butler! Miss Melly done fainted away back<br> yonder.’<br><br> ‘She's not dead? Is she breathing?’<br><br> ‘Yassuh, she breathin'.’<br><br> ‘Then she's probably better off as she is. If she were conscious,<br> I doubt if she could live through all the pain. Take good care of<br> her, Prissy. Here's a shinplaster for you. Try not to be a bigger<br> fool than you are.’<br><br> ‘Yassuh. Thankee suh.’<br><br> ‘Good-by, Scarlett.’<br><br> She knew he had turned and was facing her but she did not speak.<br> Hate choked all utterance. His feet ground on the pebbles of the<br> road and for a moment she saw his big shoulders looming up in the<br> dark. Then he was gone. She could hear the sound of his feet for<br> a while and then they died away. She came slowly back to the<br> wagon, her knees shaking.<br><br> Why had he gone, stepping off into the dark, into the war, into a<br> Cause that was lost, into a world that was mad? Why had he gone,<br> Rhett who loved the pleasures of women and liquor, the comfort of<br> good food and soft beds, the feel of fine linen and good leather,<br> who hated the South and jeered at the fools who fought for it? Now<br> he had set his varnished boots upon a bitter road where hunger<br> tramped with tireless stride and wounds and weariness and heartbreak<br> ran like yelping wolves. And the end of the road was death. He<br> need not have gone. He was safe, rich, comfortable. But he had<br> gone, leaving her alone in a night as black as blindness, with the<br> Yankee Army between her and home.<br><br> Now she remembered all the bad names she had wanted to call him but<br> it was too late. She leaned her head against the bowed neck of the<br> horse and cried.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXIV<br><br> <br> The bright glare of morning sunlight streaming through the trees<br> overhead awakened Scarlett. For a moment, stiffened by the cramped<br> position in which she had slept, she could not remember where she<br> was. The sun blinded her, the hard boards of the wagon under her<br> were harsh against her body, and a heavy weight lay across her<br> legs. She tried to sit up and discovered that the weight was Wade<br> who lay sleeping with his head pillowed on her knees. Melanie's<br> bare feet were almost in her face and, under the wagon seat, Prissy<br> was curled up like a black cat with the small baby wedged in<br> between her and Wade.<br><br> Then she remembered everything. She popped up to a sitting<br> position and looked hastily all around. Thank God, no Yankees in<br> sight! Their hiding place had not been discovered in the night.<br> It all came back to her now, the nightmare journey after Rhett's<br> footsteps died away, the endless night, the black road full of ruts<br> and boulders along which they jolted, the deep gullies on either<br> side into which the wagon slipped, the fear-crazed strength with<br> which she and Prissy had pushed the wheels out of the gullies. She<br> recalled with a shudder how often she had driven the unwilling<br> horse into fields and woods when she heard soldiers approaching,<br> not knowing if they were friends or foes--recalled, too, her<br> anguish lest a cough, a sneeze or Wade's hiccoughing might betray<br> them to the marching men.<br><br> Oh, that dark road where men went by like ghosts, voices stilled,<br> only the muffled tramping of feet on soft dirt, the faint clicking<br> of bridles and the straining creak of leather! And, oh, that<br> dreadful moment when the sick horse balked and cavalry and light<br> cannon rumbled past in the darkness, past where they sat<br> breathless, so close she could almost reach out and touch them, so<br> close she could smell the stale sweat on the soldiers' bodies!<br><br> When, at last, they had neared Rough and Ready, a few camp fires<br> were gleaming where the last of Steve Lee's rear guard was awaiting<br> orders to fall back. She had circled through a plowed field for a<br> mile until the light of the fires died out behind her. And then<br> she had lost her way in the darkness and sobbed when she could not<br> find the little wagon path she knew so well. Then finally having<br> found it, the horse sank in the traces and refused to move, refused<br> to rise even when she and Prissy tugged at the bridle.<br><br> So she had unharnessed him and crawled, sodden with fatigue, into<br> the back of the wagon and stretched her aching legs. She had a<br> faint memory of Melanie's voice before sleep clamped down her<br> eyelids, a weak voice that apologized even as it begged: ‘Scarlett,<br> can I have some water, please?’<br><br> She had said: ‘There isn't any,’ and gone to sleep before the<br> words were out of her mouth.<br><br> Now it was morning and the world was still and serene and green and<br> gold with dappled sunshine. And no soldiers in sight anywhere.<br> She was hungry and dry with thirst, aching and cramped and filled<br> with wonder that she, Scarlett O'Hara, who could never rest well<br> except between linen sheets and on the softest of feather beds, had<br> slept like a field hand on hard planks.<br><br> Blinking in the sunlight, her eyes fell on Melanie and she gasped,<br> horrified. Melanie lay so still and white Scarlett thought she<br> must be dead. She looked dead. She looked like a dead, old woman<br> with her ravaged face and her dark hair snarled and tangled across<br> it. Then Scarlett saw with relief the faint rise and fall of her<br> shallow breathing and knew that Melanie had survived the night.<br><br> Scarlett shaded her eyes with her hand and looked about her. They<br> had evidently spent the night under the trees in someone's front<br> yard, for a sand and gravel driveway stretched out before her,<br> winding away under an avenue of cedars.<br><br> ‘Why, it's the Mallory place!’ she thought, her heart leaping with<br> gladness at the thought of friends and help.<br><br> But a stillness as of death hung over the plantation. The shrubs<br> and grass of the lawn were cut to pieces where hooves and wheels<br> and feet had torn frantically back and forth until the soil was<br> churned up. She looked toward the house and instead of the old<br> white clapboard place she knew so well, she saw there only a long<br> rectangle of blackened granite foundation stones and two tall<br> chimneys rearing smoke-stained bricks into the charred leaves of<br> still trees.<br><br> She drew a deep shuddering breath. Would she find Tara like this,<br> level with the ground, silent as the dead?<br><br> ‘I mustn't think about that now,’ she told herself hurriedly. ‘I<br> mustn't let myself think about it. I'll get scared again if I<br> think about it.’ But, in spite of herself, her heart quickened and<br> each beat seemed to thunder: ‘Home! Hurry! Home! Hurry!’<br><br> They must be starting on toward home again. But first they must<br> find some food and water, especially water. She prodded Prissy<br> awake. Prissy rolled her eyes as she looked about her.<br><br> ‘Fo' Gawd, Miss Scarlett, Ah din' spec ter wake up agin 'cept in de<br> Promise Lan'.’<br><br> ‘You're a long way from there,’ said Scarlett, trying to smooth<br> back her untidy hair. Her face was damp and her body was already<br> wet with sweat. She felt dirty and messy and sticky, almost as if<br> she smelled bad. Her clothes were crushed and wrinkled from<br> sleeping in them and she had never felt more acutely tired and sore<br> in all her life. Muscles she did not know she possessed ached from<br> her unaccustomed exertions of the night before and every movement<br> brought sharp pain.<br><br> She looked down at Melanie and saw that her dark eyes were opened.<br> They were sick eyes, fever bright, and dark baggy circles were<br> beneath them. She opened cracking lips and whispered appealingly:<br> ‘Water.’<br><br> ‘Get up, Prissy,’ ordered Scarlett. ‘We'll go to the well and get<br> some water.’<br><br> ‘But, Miss Scarlett! Dey mout be hants up dar. Sposin' somebody<br> daid up dar?’<br><br> ‘I'll make a hant out of you if you don't get out of this wagon,’<br> said Scarlett, who was in no mood for argument, as she climbed<br> lamely down to the ground.<br><br> And then she thought of the horse. Name of God! Suppose the horse<br> had died in the night! He had seemed ready to die when she<br> unharnessed him. She ran around the wagon and saw him lying on his<br> side. If he were dead, she would curse God and die too. Somebody<br> in the Bible had done just that thing. Cursed God and died. She<br> knew just how that person felt. But the horse was alive--breathing<br> heavily, sick eyes half closed, but alive. Well, some water would<br> help him too.<br><br> Prissy climbed reluctantly from the wagon with many groans and<br> timorously followed Scarlett up the avenue. Behind the ruins the<br> row of whitewashed slave quarters stood silent and deserted under<br> the overhanging trees. Between the quarters and the smoked stone<br> foundations, they found the well, and the roof of it still stood<br> with the bucket far down the well. Between them, they wound up the<br> rope, and when the bucket of cool sparkling water appeared out of<br> the dark depths, Scarlett tilted it to her lips and drank with loud<br> sucking noises, spilling the water all over herself.<br><br> She drank until Prissy's petulant: ‘Well, Ah's thusty, too, Miss<br> Scarlett,’ made her recall the needs of the others.<br><br> ‘Untie the knot and take the bucket to the wagon and give them<br> some. And give the rest to the horse. Don't you think Miss<br> Melanie ought to nurse the baby? He'll starve.’<br><br> ‘Law, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly ain' got no milk--ain' gwine have<br> none.’<br><br> ‘How do you know?’<br><br> ‘Ah's seed too many lak her.’<br><br> ‘Don't go putting on any airs with me. A precious little you knew<br> about babies yesterday. Hurry now. I'm going to try to find<br> something to eat.’<br><br> Scarlett's search was futile until in the orchard she found a few<br> apples. Soldiers had been there before her and there was none on<br> the trees. Those she found on the ground were mostly rotten. She<br> filled her skirt with the best of them and came back across the<br> soft earth, collecting small pebbles in her slippers. Why hadn't<br> she thought of putting on stouter shoes last night? Why hadn't she<br> brought her sun hat? Why hadn't she brought something to eat?<br> She'd acted like a fool. But, of course, she'd thought Rhett would<br> take care of them.<br><br> Rhett! She spat on the ground, for the very name tasted bad. How<br> she hated him! How contemptible he had been! And she had stood<br> there in the road and let him kiss her--and almost liked it. She<br> had been crazy last night. How despicable he was!<br><br> When she came back, she divided up the apples and threw the rest<br> into the back of the wagon. The horse was on his feet now but the<br> water did not seem to have refreshed him much. He looked far worse<br> in the daylight than he had the night before. His hip bones stood<br> out like an old cow's, his ribs showed like a washboard and his<br> back was a mass of sores. She shrank from touching him as she<br> harnessed him. When she slipped the bit into his mouth, she saw<br> that he was practically toothless. As old as the hills! While<br> Rhett was stealing a horse, why couldn't he have stolen a good one?<br><br> She mounted the seat and brought down the hickory limb on his back.<br> He wheezed and started, but he walked so slowly as she turned him<br> into the road she knew she could walk faster herself with no effort<br> whatever. Oh, if only she didn't have Melanie and Wade and the<br> baby and Prissy to bother with! How swiftly she could walk home!<br> Why, she would run home, run every step of the way that would bring<br> her closer to Tara and to Mother.<br><br> They couldn't be more than fifteen miles from home, but at the rate<br> this old nag traveled it would take all day, for she would have to<br> stop frequently to rest him. All day! She looked down the glaring<br> red road, cut in deep ruts where cannon wheels and ambulances had<br> gone over it. It would be hours before she knew if Tara still<br> stood and if Ellen were there. It would be hours before she<br> finished her journey under the broiling September sun.<br><br> She looked back at Melanie who lay with sick eyes closed against<br> the sun and jerked loose the strings of her bonnet and tossed it to<br> Prissy.<br><br> ‘Put that over her face. It'll keep the sun out of her eyes.’<br> Then as the heat beat down upon her unprotected head, she thought:<br> ‘I'll be as freckled as a guinea egg before this day is over.’<br><br> She had never in her life been out in the sunshine without a hat or<br> veils, never handled reins without gloves to protect the white skin<br> of her dimpled hands. Yet here she was exposed to the sun in a<br> broken-down wagon with a broken-down horse, dirty, sweaty, hungry,<br> helpless to do anything but plod along at a snail's pace through a<br> deserted land. What a few short weeks it had been since she was<br> safe and secure! What a little while since she and everyone else<br> had thought that Atlanta could never fall, that Georgia could never<br> be invaded. But the small cloud which appeared in the northwest<br> four months ago had blown up into a mighty storm and then into a<br> screaming tornado, sweeping away her world, whirling her out of her<br> sheltered life, and dropping her down in the midst of this still,<br> haunted desolation.<br><br> Was Tara still standing? Or was Tara also gone with the wind which<br> had swept through Georgia?<br><br> She laid the whip on the tired horse's back and tried to urge him<br> on while the waggling wheels rocked them drunkenly from side to<br> side.<br><br> <br><br> There was death in the air. In the rays of the late afternoon sun,<br> every well-remembered field and forest grove was green and still,<br> with an unearthly quiet that struck terror to Scarlett's heart.<br> Every empty, shell-pitted house they had passed that day, every<br> gaunt chimney standing sentinel over smoke-blackened ruins, had<br> frightened her more. They had not seen a living human being or<br> animal since the night before. Dead men and dead horses, yes, and<br> dead mules, lying by the road, swollen, covered with flies, but<br> nothing alive. No far-off cattle lowed, no birds sang, no wind<br> waved the trees. Only the tired plop-plop of the horse's feet and<br> the weak wailing of Melanie's baby broke the stillness.<br><br> The countryside lay as under some dread enchantment. Or worse<br> still, thought Scarlett with a chill, like the familiar and dear<br> face of a mother, beautiful and quiet at last, after death agonies.<br> She felt that the once-familiar woods were full of ghosts.<br> Thousands had died in the fighting near Jonesboro. They were here<br> in these haunted woods where the slanting afternoon sun gleamed<br> eerily through unmoving leaves, friends and foes, peering at her in<br> her rickety wagon, through eyes blinded with blood and red dust--<br> glazed, horrible eyes.<br><br> ‘Mother! Mother!’ she whispered. If she could only win to Ellen!<br> If only, by a miracle of God, Tara were still standing and she<br> could drive up the long avenue of trees and go into the house and<br> see her mother's kind, tender face, could feel once more the soft<br> capable hands that drove out fear, could clutch Ellen's skirts and<br> bury her face in them. Mother would know what to do. She wouldn't<br> let Melanie and her baby die. She would drive away all ghosts and<br> fears with her quiet ‘Hush, hush.’ But Mother was ill, perhaps<br> dying.<br><br> Scarlett laid the whip across the weary rump of the horse. They<br> must go faster! They had crept along this never-ending road all<br> the long hot day. Soon it would be night and they would be alone<br> in this desolation that was death. She gripped the reins tighter<br> with hands that were blistered and slapped them fiercely on the<br> horse's back, her aching arms burning at the movement.<br><br> If she could only reach the kind arms of Tara and Ellen and lay<br> down her burdens, far too heavy for her young shoulders--the dying<br> woman, the fading baby, her own hungry little boy, the frightened<br> negro, all looking to her for strength, for guidance, all reading<br> in her straight back courage she did not possess and strength which<br> had long since failed.<br><br> The exhausted horse did not respond to the whip or reins but<br> shambled on, dragging his feet, stumbling on small rocks and<br> swaying as if ready to fall to his knees. But, as twilight came,<br> they at last entered the final lap of the long journey. They<br> rounded the bend of the wagon path and turned into the main road.<br> Tara was only a mile away!<br><br> Here loomed up the dark bulk of the mock-orange hedge that marked<br> the beginning of the MacIntosh property. A little farther on,<br> Scarlett drew rein in front of the avenue of oaks that led from the<br> road to old Angus MacIntosh's house. She peered through the<br> gathering dusk down the two lines of ancient trees. All was dark.<br> Not a single light showed in the house or in the quarters.<br> Straining her eyes in the darkness she dimly discerned a sight<br> which had grown familiar through that terrible day--two tall<br> chimneys, like gigantic tombstones towering above the ruined second<br> floor, and broken unlit windows blotching the walls like still,<br> blind eyes.<br><br> ‘Hello!’ she shouted, summoning all her strength. ‘Hello!’<br><br> Prissy clawed at her in a frenzy of fright and Scarlett, turning,<br> saw that her eyes were rolling in her head.<br><br> ‘Doan holler, Miss Scarlett! Please, doan holler agin!’ she<br> whispered, her voice shaking. ‘Dey ain' no tellin' WHUT mout<br> answer!’<br><br> ‘Dear God!’ thought Scarlett, a shiver running through her. ‘Dear<br> God! She's right. Anything might come out of there!’<br><br> She flapped the reins and urged the horse forward. The sight of<br> the MacIntosh house had pricked the last bubble of hope remaining<br> to her. It was burned, in ruins, deserted, as were all the<br> plantations she had passed that day. Tara lay only half a mile<br> away, on the same road, right in the path of the army. Tara was<br> leveled, too! She would find only the blackened bricks, starlight<br> shining through the roofless walls, Ellen and Gerald gone, the<br> girls gone, Mammy gone, the negroes gone, God knows where, and this<br> hideous stillness over everything.<br><br> Why had she come on this fool's errand, against all common sense,<br> dragging Melanie and her child? Better that they had died in<br> Atlanta than, tortured by this day of burning sun and jolting<br> wagon, to die in the silent ruins of Tara.<br><br> But Ashley had left Melanie in her care. ‘Take care of her.’ Oh,<br> that beautiful, heartbreaking day when he had kissed her good-by<br> before he went away forever! ‘You'll take care of her, won't you?<br> Promise!’ And she had promised. Why had she ever bound herself<br> with such a promise, doubly binding now that Ashley was gone? Even<br> in her exhaustion she hated Melanie, hated the tiny mewing voice of<br> her child which, fainter and fainter, pierced the stillness. But<br> she had promised and now they belonged to her, even as Wade and<br> Prissy belonged to her, and she must struggle and fight for them as<br> long as she had strength or breath. She could have left them in<br> Atlanta, dumped Melanie into the hospital and deserted her. But<br> had she done that, she could never face Ashley, either on this<br> earth or in the hereafter and tell him she had left his wife and<br> child to die among strangers.<br><br> Oh, Ashley! Where was he tonight while she toiled down this<br> haunted road with his wife and baby? Was he alive and did he think<br> of her as he lay behind the bars at Rock Island? Or was he dead of<br> smallpox months ago, rotting in some long ditch with hundreds of<br> other Confederates?<br><br> Scarlett's taut nerves almost cracked as a sudden noise sounded in<br> the underbrush near them. Prissy screamed loudly, throwing herself<br> to the floor of the wagon, the baby beneath her. Melanie stirred<br> feebly, her hands seeking the baby, and Wade covered his eyes and<br> cowered, too frightened to cry. Then the bushes beside them<br> crashed apart under heavy hooves and a low moaning bawl assaulted<br> their ears.<br><br> ‘It's only a cow,’ said Scarlett, her voice rough with fright.<br> ‘Don't be a fool, Prissy. You've mashed the baby and frightened<br> Miss Melly and Wade.’<br><br> ‘It's a ghos',’ moaned Prissy, writhing face down on the wagon<br> boards.<br><br> Turning deliberately, Scarlett raised the tree limb she had been<br> using as a whip and brought it down across Prissy's back. She was<br> too exhausted and weak from fright to tolerate weakness in anyone<br> else.<br><br> ‘Sit up, you fool,’ she said, ‘before I wear this out on you.’<br><br> Yelping, Prissy raised her head and peering over the side of the<br> wagon saw it was, indeed, a cow, a red and white animal which stood<br> looking at them appealingly with large frightened eyes. Opening<br> its mouth, it lowed again as if in pain.<br><br> ‘Is it hurt? That doesn't sound like an ordinary moo.’<br><br> ‘Soun' ter me lak her bag full an' she need milkin' bad,’ said<br> Prissy, regaining some measure of control. ‘Spec it one of Mist'<br> MacIntosh's dat de niggers driv in de woods an' de Yankees din'<br> git.’<br><br> ‘We'll take it with us,’ Scarlett decided swiftly. ‘Then we can<br> have some milk for the baby.’<br><br> ‘How all we gwine tek a cow wid us, Miss Scarlett? We kain tek no<br> cow wid us. Cow ain' no good nohow effen she ain' been milked<br> lately. Dey bags swells up and busts. Dat's why she hollerin'.’<br><br> ‘Since you know so much about it, take off your petticoat and tear<br> it up and tie her to the back of the wagon.’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, you knows Ah ain' had no petticoat fer a month an'<br> did Ah have one, Ah wouldn' put it on her fer nuthin'. Ah nebber<br> had no truck wid cows. Ah's sceered of cows.’<br><br> Scarlett laid down the reins and pulled up her skirt. The lace-<br> trimmed petticoat beneath was the last garment she possessed that<br> was pretty--and whole. She untied the waist tape and slipped it<br> down over her feet, crushing the soft linen folds between her<br> hands. Rhett had brought her that linen and lace from Nassau on<br> the last boat he slipped through the blockade and she had worked a<br> week to make the garment. Resolutely she took it by the hem and<br> jerked, put it in her mouth and gnawed, until finally the material<br> gave with a rip and tore the length. She gnawed furiously, tore<br> with both hands and the petticoat lay in strips in her hands. She<br> knotted the ends with fingers that bled from blisters and shook<br> from fatigue.<br><br> ‘Slip this over her horns,’ she directed. But Prissy balked.<br><br> ‘Ah's sceered of cows, Miss Scarlett. Ah ain' nebber had nuthin'<br> ter do wid cows. Ah ain' no yard nigger. Ah's a house nigger.’<br><br> ‘You're a fool nigger, and the worst day's work Pa ever did was to<br> buy you,’ said Scarlett slowly, too tired for anger. ‘And if I<br> ever get the use of my arm again, I'll wear this whip out on you.’<br><br> There, she thought, I've said ‘nigger’ and Mother wouldn't like<br> that at all.<br><br> Prissy rolled her eyes wildly, peeping first at the set face of her<br> mistress and then at the cow which bawled plaintively. Scarlett<br> seemed the less dangerous of the two, so Prissy clutched at the<br> sides of the wagon and remained where she was.<br><br> Stiffly, Scarlett climbed down from the seat, each movement of<br> agony of aching muscles. Prissy was not the only one who was<br> ‘sceered’ of cows. Scarlett had always feared them, even the<br> mildest cow seemed sinister to her, but this was no time to truckle<br> to small fears when great ones crowded so thick upon her.<br> Fortunately the cow was gentle. In its pain it had sought human<br> companionship and help and it made no threatening gesture as she<br> looped one end of the torn petticoat about its horns. She tied the<br> other end to the back of the wagon, as securely as her awkward<br> fingers would permit. Then, as she started back toward the<br> driver's seat, a vast weariness assailed her and she swayed<br> dizzily. She clutched the side of the wagon to keep from falling.<br><br> Melanie opened her eyes and, seeing Scarlett standing beside her,<br> whispered: ‘Dear--are we home?’<br><br> Home! Hot tears came to Scarlett's eyes at the word. Home.<br> Melanie did not know there was no home and that they were alone in<br> a mad and desolate world.<br><br> ‘Not yet,’ she said, as gently as the constriction of her throat<br> would permit, ‘but we will be, soon. I've just found a cow and<br> soon we'll have some milk for you and the baby.’<br><br> ‘Poor baby,’ whispered Melanie, her hand creeping feebly toward the<br> child and falling short.<br><br> Climbing back into the wagon required all the strength Scarlett<br> could muster, but at last it was done and she picked up the lines.<br> The horse stood with head drooping dejectedly and refused to start.<br> Scarlett laid on the whip mercilessly. She hoped God would forgive<br> her for hurting a tired animal. If He didn't she was sorry. After<br> all, Tara lay just ahead, and after the next quarter of a mile, the<br> horse could drop in the shafts if he liked.<br><br> Finally he started slowly, the wagon creaking and the cow lowing<br> mournfully at every step. The pained animal's voice rasped on<br> Scarlett's nerves until she was tempted to stop and untie the<br> beast. What good would the cow do them anyway if there should be<br> no one at Tara? She couldn't milk her and, even if she could, the<br> animal would probably kick anyone who touched her sore udder. But<br> she had the cow and she might as well keep her. There was little<br> else she had in this world now.<br><br> Scarlett's eyes grew misty when, at last, they reached the bottom<br> of a gentle incline, for just over the rise lay Tara! Then her<br> heart sank. The decrepit animal would never pull the hill. The<br> slope had always seemed so slight, so gradual, in days when she<br> galloped up it on her fleet-footed mare. It did not seem possible<br> it could have grown so steep since she saw it last. The horse<br> would never make it with the heavy load.<br><br> Wearily she dismounted and took the animal by the bridle.<br><br> ‘Get out, Prissy,’ she commanded, ‘and take Wade. Either carry him<br> or make him walk. Lay the baby by Miss Melanie.’<br><br> Wade broke into sobs and whimperings from which Scarlett could only<br> distinguish: ‘Dark--dark--Wade fwightened!’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, Ah kain walk. Mah feets done blistered an' dey's<br> thoo mah shoes, an' Wade an' me doan weigh so much an'--’<br><br> ‘Get out! Get out before I pull you out! And if I do, I'm going<br> to leave you right here, in the dark by yourself. Quick, now!’<br><br> Prissy moaned, peering at the dark trees that closed about them on<br> both sides of the road--trees which might reach out and clutch her<br> if she left the shelter of the wagon. But she laid the baby beside<br> Melanie, scrambled to the ground and, reaching up, lifted Wade out.<br> The little boy sobbed, shrinking close to his nurse.<br><br> ‘Make him hush. I can't stand it,’ said Scarlett, taking the horse<br> by the bridle and pulling him to a reluctant start. ‘Be a little<br> man, Wade, and stop crying or I will come over there and slap you.’<br><br> Why had God invented children, she thought savagely as she turned<br> her ankle cruelly on the dark road--useless, crying nuisances they<br> were, always demanding care, always in the way. In her exhaustion,<br> there was no room for compassion for the frightened child, trotting<br> by Prissy's side, dragging at her hand and sniffling--only a<br> weariness that she had borne him, only a tired wonder that she had<br> ever married Charles Hamilton.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett,’ whispered Prissy, clutching her mistress' arm,<br> ‘doan le's go ter Tara. Dey's not dar. Dey's all done gone.<br> Maybe dey daid--Maw an' all'm.’<br><br> The echo of her own thoughts infuriated her and Scarlett shook off<br> the pinching fingers.<br><br> ‘Then give me Wade's hand. You can sit right down here and stay.’<br><br> ‘No'm! No'm!’<br><br> ‘Then HUSH!’<br><br> How slowly the horse moved! The moisture from his slobbering mouth<br> dripped down upon her hand. Through her mind ran a few words of<br> the song she had once sung with Rhett--she could not recall the<br> rest:<br><br> <br> ‘Just a few more days for to tote the weary load--’<br><br> <br> ‘Just a few more steps,’ hummed her brain, over and over, ‘just a<br> few more steps for to tote the weary load.’<br><br> Then they topped the rise and before them lay the oaks of Tara, a<br> towering dark mass against the darkening sky. Scarlett looked<br> hastily to see if there was a light anywhere. There was none.<br><br> ‘They are gone!’ said her heart, like cold lead in her breast.<br> ‘Gone!’<br><br> She turned the horse's head into the driveway, and the cedars,<br> meeting over their heads cast them into midnight blackness.<br> Peering up the long tunnel of darkness, straining her eyes she saw<br> ahead--or did she see? Were her tired eyes playing her tricks?--<br> the white bricks of Tara blurred and indistinct. Home! Home! The<br> dear white walls, the windows with the fluttering curtains, the<br> wide verandas--were they all there ahead of her, in the gloom? Or<br> did the darkness mercifully conceal such a horror as the MacIntosh<br> house?<br><br> The avenue seemed miles long and the horse, pulling stubbornly at<br> her hand, plopped slower and slower. Eagerly her eyes searched the<br> darkness. The roof seemed to be intact. Could it be--could it<br> be--? No, it wasn't possible. War stopped for nothing, not even<br> Tara, built to last five hundred years. It could not have passed<br> over Tara.<br><br> Then the shadowy outline did take form. She pulled the horse<br> forward faster. The white walls did show there through the<br> darkness. And untarnished by smoke. Tara had escaped! Home! She<br> dropped the bridle and ran the last few steps, leaped forward with<br> an urge to clutch the walls themselves in her arms. Then she saw a<br> form, shadowy in the dimness, emerging from the blackness of the<br> front veranda and standing at the top of the steps. Tara was not<br> deserted. Someone was home!<br><br> A cry of joy rose to her throat and died there. The house was so<br> dark and still and the figure did not move or call to her. What<br> was wrong? What was wrong? Tara stood intact, yet shrouded with<br> the same eerie quiet that hung over the whole stricken countryside.<br> Then the figure moved. Stiffly and slowly, it came down the steps.<br><br> ‘Pa?’ she whispered huskily, doubting almost that it was he. ‘It's<br> me--Katie Scarlett. I've come home.’<br><br> Gerald moved toward her, silent as a sleepwalker, his stiff leg<br> dragging. He came close to her, looking at her in a dazed way as<br> if he believed she was part of a dream. Putting out his hand, he<br> laid it on her shoulder. Scarlett felt it tremble, tremble as if<br> he had been awakened from a nightmare into a half-sense of reality.<br><br> ‘Daughter,’ he said with an effort. ‘Daughter.’<br><br> Then he was silent.<br><br> Why--he's an old man! thought Scarlett.<br><br> Gerald's shoulders sagged. In the face which she could only see<br> dimly, there was none of the virility, the restless vitality of<br> Gerald, and the eyes that looked into hers had almost the same<br> fear-stunned look that lay in little Wade's eyes. He was only a<br> little old man and broken.<br><br> And now, fear of unknown things seized her, leaped swiftly out of<br> the darkness at her and she could only stand and stare at him, all<br> the flood of questioning dammed up at her lips.<br><br> From the wagon the faint wailing sounded again and Gerald seemed to<br> rouse himself with an effort.<br><br> ‘It's Melanie and her baby,’ whispered Scarlett rapidly. ‘She's<br> very ill--I brought her home.’<br><br> Gerald dropped his hand from her arm and straightened his<br> shoulders. As he moved slowly to the side of the wagon, there was<br> a ghostly semblance of the old host of Tara welcoming guests, as if<br> Gerald spoke words from out of shadowy memory.<br><br> ‘Cousin Melanie!’<br><br> Melanie's voice murmured indistinctly.<br><br> ‘Cousin Melanie, this is your home. Twelve Oaks is burned. You<br> must stay with us.’<br><br> Thoughts of Melanie's prolonged suffering spurred Scarlett to<br> action. The present was with her again, the necessity of laying<br> Melanie and her child on a soft bed and doing those small things<br> for her that could be done.<br><br> ‘She must be carried. She can't walk.’<br><br> There was a scuffle of feet and a dark figure emerged from the cave<br> of the front hall. Pork ran down the steps.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!’ he cried.<br><br> Scarlett caught him by the arms. Pork, part and parcel of Tara, as<br> dear as the bricks and the cool corridors! She felt his tears<br> stream down on her hands as he patted her clumsily, crying: ‘Sho<br> is glad you back! Sho is--’<br><br> Prissy burst into tears and incoherent mumblings: ‘Poke! Poke,<br> honey!’ And little Wade, encouraged by the weakness of his elders,<br> began sniffling: ‘Wade thirsty!’<br><br> Scarlett caught them all in hand.<br><br> ‘Miss Melanie is in the wagon and her baby too. Pork, you must<br> carry her upstairs very carefully and put her in the back company<br> room. Prissy, take the baby and Wade inside and give Wade a drink<br> of water. Is Mammy here, Pork? Tell her I want her.’<br><br> Galvanized by the authority in her voice, Pork approached the wagon<br> and fumbled at the backboard. A moan was wrenched from Melanie as<br> he half-lifted, half-dragged her from the feather tick on which she<br> had lain so many hours. And then she was in Pork's strong arms,<br> her head drooping like a child's across his shoulder. Prissy,<br> holding the baby and dragging Wade by the hand, followed them up<br> the wide steps and disappeared into the blackness of the hall.<br><br> Scarlett's bleeding fingers sought her father's hand urgently.<br><br> ‘Did they get well, Pa?’<br><br> ‘The girls are recovering.’<br><br> Silence fell and in the silence an idea too monstrous for words<br> took form. She could not, could not force it to her lips. She<br> swallowed and swallowed but a sudden dryness seemed to have stuck<br> the sides of her throat together. Was this the answer to the<br> frightening riddle of Tara's silence? As if answering the question<br> in her mind Gerald spoke.<br><br> ‘Your mother--’ he said and stopped.<br><br> ‘And--Mother?’<br><br> ‘Your mother died yesterday.’<br><br> <br><br> Her father's arm held tightly in her own, Scarlett felt her way<br> down the wide dark hall which, even in its blackness, was as<br> familiar as her own mind. She avoided the high-backed chairs, the<br> empty gun rack, the old sideboard with its protruding claw feet,<br> and she felt herself drawn by instinct to the tiny office at the<br> back of the house where Ellen always sat, keeping her endless<br> accounts. Surely, when she entered that room, Mother would again<br> be sitting there before the secretary and would look up, quill<br> poised, and rise with sweet fragrance and rustling hoops to meet<br> her tired daughter. Ellen could not be dead, not even though Pa<br> had said it, said it over and over like a parrot that knows only<br> one phrase: ‘She died yesterday--she died yesterday--she died<br> yesterday.’<br><br> Queer that she should feel nothing now, nothing except a weariness<br> that shackled her limbs with heavy iron chains and a hunger that<br> made her knees tremble. She would think of Mother later. She must<br> put her mother out of her mind now, else she would stumble stupidly<br> like Gerald or sob monotonously like Wade.<br><br> Pork came down the wide dark steps toward them, hurrying to press<br> close to Scarlett like a cold animal toward a fire.<br><br> ‘Lights?’ she questioned. ‘Why is the house so dark, Pork? Bring<br> candles.’<br><br> ‘Dey tuck all de candles, Miss Scarlett, all 'cept one we been<br> usin' ter fine things in de dahk wid, an' it's 'bout gone. Mammy<br> been usin' a rag in a dish of hawg fat fer a light fer nussin' Miss<br> Careen an' Miss Suellen.’<br><br> ‘Bring what's left of the candle,’ she ordered. ‘Bring it into<br> Mother's--into the office.’<br><br> Pork pattered into the dining room and Scarlett groped her way into<br> the inky small room and sank down on the sofa. Her father's arm<br> still lay in the crook of hers, helpless, appealing, trusting, as<br> only the hands of the very young and the very old can be.<br><br> ‘He's an old man, an old tired man,’ she thought again and vaguely<br> wondered why she could not care.<br><br> Light wavered into the room as Pork entered carrying high a half-<br> burned candle stuck in a saucer. The dark cave came to life, the<br> sagging old sofa on which they sat, the tall secretary reaching<br> toward the ceiling with Mother's fragile carved chair before it,<br> the racks of pigeonholes, still stuffed with papers written in her<br> fine hand, the worn carpet--all, all were the same, except that<br> Ellen was not there, Ellen with the faint scent of lemon verbena<br> sachet and the sweet look in her up-tilted eyes. Scarlett felt a<br> small pain in her heart as of nerves numbed by a deep wound,<br> struggling to make themselves felt again. She must not let them<br> come to life now; there was all the rest of her life ahead of her<br> in which they could ache. But, not now! Please, God, not now!<br><br> She looked into Gerald's putty-colored face and, for the first time<br> in her life, she saw him unshaven, his once florid face covered<br> with silvery bristles. Pork placed the candle on the candle stand<br> and came to her side. Scarlett felt that if he had been a dog he<br> would have laid his muzzle in her lap and whined for a kind hand<br> upon his head.<br><br> ‘Pork, how many darkies are here?’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, dem trashy niggers done runned away an' some of dem<br> went off wid de Yankees an'--’<br><br> ‘How many are left?’<br><br> ‘Dey's me, Miss Scarlett, an' Mammy. She been nussin' de young<br> Misses all day. An' Dilcey, she settin' up wid de young Misses<br> now. Us three, Miss Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘Us three’ where there had been a hundred. Scarlett with an effort<br> lifted her head on her aching neck. She knew she must keep her<br> voice steady. To her surprise, words came out as coolly and<br> naturally as if there had never been a war and she could, by waving<br> her hand, call ten house servants to her.<br><br> ‘Pork, I'm starving. Is there anything to eat?’<br><br> ‘No'm. Dey tuck it all.’<br><br> ‘But the garden?’<br><br> ‘Dey tuhned dey hawses loose in it.’<br><br> ‘Even the sweet potato hills?’<br><br> Something almost like a pleased smile broke his thick lips.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, Ah done fergit de yams. Ah specs dey's right dar.<br> Dem Yankee folks ain' never seed no yams an' dey thinks dey's jes'<br> roots an'--’<br><br> ‘The moon will be up soon. You go out and dig us some and roast<br> them. There's no corn meal? No dried peas? No chickens?’<br><br> ‘No'm. No'm. Whut chickens dey din' eat right hyah dey cah'ied<br> off 'cross dey saddles.’<br><br> They-- They-- They-- Was there no end to what 'They’ had done?<br> Was it not enough to burn and kill? Must they also leave women and<br> children and helpless negroes to starve in a country which they had<br> desolated?<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, Ah got some apples Mammy buhied unner de house. We<br> been eatin' on dem today.’<br><br> ‘Bring them before you dig the potatoes. And, Pork--I--I feel so<br> faint. Is there any wine in the cellar, even blackberry?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Miss Scarlett, de cellar wuz de fust place dey went.’<br><br> A swimming nausea compounded of hunger, sleeplessness, exhaustion<br> and stunning blows came on suddenly and she gripped the carved<br> roses under her hand.<br><br> ‘No wine,’ she said dully, remembering the endless rows of bottles<br> in the cellar. A memory stirred.<br><br> ‘Pork, what of the corn whisky Pa buried in the oak barrel under<br> the scuppernong arbor?’<br><br> Another ghost of a smile lit the black face, a smile of pleasure<br> and respect.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, you sho is de beatenes' chile! Ah done plum fergit<br> dat bah'l. But, Miss Scarlett, dat whisky ain' no good. Ain' been<br> dar but 'bout a year an' whisky ain' no good fer ladies nohow.’<br><br> How stupid negroes were! They never thought of anything unless<br> they were told. And the Yankees wanted to free them.<br><br> ‘It'll be good enough for this lady and for Pa. Hurry, Pork, and<br> dig it up and bring us two glasses and some mint and sugar and I'll<br> mix a julep.’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, you knows dey ain' been no sugar at Tara fer de<br> longes'. An' dey hawses done et up all de mint an' dey done broke<br> all de glasses.’<br><br> If he says ‘They’ once more, I'll scream. I can't help it, she<br> thought, and then, aloud: ‘Well, hurry and get the whisky,<br> quickly. We'll take it neat.’ And, as he turned: ‘Wait, Pork.<br> There's so many things to do that I can't seem to think. . . . Oh,<br> yes. I brought home a horse and a cow and the cow needs milking,<br> badly, and unharness the horse and water him. Go tell Mammy to<br> look after the cow. Tell her she's got to fix the cow up somehow.<br> Miss Melanie's baby will die if he doesn't get something to eat<br> and--’<br><br> ‘Miss Melly ain'--kain--?’ Pork paused delicately.<br><br> ‘Miss Melanie has no milk.’ Dear God, but Mother would faint at<br> that!<br><br> ‘Well, Miss Scarlett, mah Dilcey ten' ter Miss Melly's chile. Mah<br> Dilcey got a new chile herseff an' she got mo'n nuff fer both.’<br><br> ‘You've got a new baby, Pork?’<br><br> Babies, babies, babies. Why did God make so many babies? But no,<br> God didn't make them. Stupid people made them.<br><br> ‘Yas'm, big fat black boy. He--’<br><br> ‘Go tell Dilcey to leave the girls. I'll look after them. Tell<br> her to nurse Miss Melanie's baby and do what she can for Miss<br> Melanie. Tell Mammy to look after the cow and put that poor horse<br> in the stable.’<br><br> ‘Dey ain' no stable, Miss Scarlett. Dey use it fer fiah wood.’<br><br> ‘Don't tell me any more what 'They' did. Tell Dilcey to look after<br> them. And you, Pork, go dig up that whisky and then some<br> potatoes.’<br><br> ‘But, Miss Scarlett, Ah ain' got no light ter dig by.’<br><br> ‘You can use a stick of firewood, can't you?’<br><br> ‘Dey ain' no fiah wood--Dey--’<br><br> ‘Do something. . . . I don't care what. But dig those things and<br> dig them fast. Now, hurry.’<br><br> Pork scurried from the room as her voice roughened and Scarlett was<br> left alone with Gerald. She patted his leg gently. She noted how<br> shrunken were the thighs that once bulged with saddle muscles. She<br> must do something to drag him from his apathy--but she could not<br> ask about Mother. That must come later, when she could stand it.<br><br> ‘Why didn't they burn Tara?’<br><br> Gerald stared at her for a moment as if not hearing her and she<br> repeated her question.<br><br> ‘Why--’ he fumbled, ‘they used the house as a headquarters.’<br><br> ‘Yankees--in this house?’<br><br> A feeling that the beloved walls had been defiled rose in her.<br> This house, sacred because Ellen had lived in it, and those--those--<br> in it.<br><br> ‘So they were, Daughter. We saw the smoke from Twelve Oaks, across<br> the river, before they came. But Miss Honey and Miss India and<br> some of their darkies had refugeed to Macon, so we did not worry<br> about them. But we couldn't be going to Macon. The girls were so<br> sick--your mother--we couldn't be going. Our darkies ran--I'm not<br> knowing where. They stole the wagons and the mules. Mammy and<br> Dilcey and Pork--they didn't run. The girls--your mother--we<br> couldn't be moving them.’<br><br> ‘Yes, yes.’ He mustn't talk about Mother. Anything else. Even<br> that General Sherman himself had used this room, Mother's office,<br> for his headquarters. Anything else.<br><br> ‘The Yankees were moving on Jonesboro, to cut the railroad. And<br> they came up the road from the river--thousands and thousands--and<br> cannon and horses--thousands. I met them on the front porch.’<br><br> ‘Oh, gallant little Gerald!’ thought Scarlett, her heart swelling,<br> Gerald meeting the enemy on the stairs of Tara as if an army stood<br> behind him instead of in front of him.<br><br> ‘They said for me to leave, that they would be burning the place.<br> And I said that they would be burning it over my head. We could<br> not leave--the girls--your mother were--’<br><br> ‘And then?’ Must he revert to Ellen always?<br><br> ‘I told them there was sickness in the house, the typhoid, and it<br> was death to move them. They could burn the roof over us. I did<br> not want to leave anyway--leave Tara--’<br><br> His voice trailed off into silence as he looked absently about the<br> walls and Scarlett understood. There were too many Irish ancestors<br> crowding behind Gerald's shoulders, men who had died on scant<br> acres, fighting to the end rather than leave the homes where they<br> had lived, plowed, loved, begotten sons.<br><br> ‘I said that they would be burning the house over the heads of<br> three dying women. But we would not leave. The young officer was--<br> was a gentleman.’<br><br> ‘A Yankee a gentleman? Why, Pa!’<br><br> ‘A gentleman. He galloped away and soon he was back with a<br> captain, a surgeon, and he looked at the girls--and your mother.’<br><br> ‘You let a damned Yankee into their room?’<br><br> ‘He had opium. We had none. He saved your sisters. Suellen was<br> hemorrhaging. He was as kind as he knew how. And when he reported<br> that they were--ill--they did not burn the house. They moved in,<br> some general, his staff, crowding in. They filled all the rooms<br> except the sick room. And the soldiers--’<br><br> He paused again, as if too tired to go on. His stubbly chin sank<br> heavily in loose folds of flesh on his chest. With an effort he<br> spoke again.<br><br> ‘They camped all round the house, everywhere, in the cotton, in the<br> corn. The pasture was blue with them. That night there were a<br> thousand campfires. They tore down the fences and burned them to<br> cook with and the barns and the stables and the smokehouse. They<br> killed the cows and the hogs and the chickens--even my turkeys.’<br> Gerald's precious turkeys. So they were gone. ‘They took things,<br> even the pictures--some of the furniture, the china--’<br><br> ‘The silver?’<br><br> ‘Pork and Mammy did something with the silver--put it in the well--<br> but I'm not remembering now,’ Gerald's voice was fretful. ‘Then<br> they fought the battle from here--from Tara--there was so much<br> noise, people galloping up and stamping about. And later the<br> cannon at Jonesboro--it sounded like thunder--even the girls could<br> hear it, sick as they were, and they kept saying over and over:<br> 'Papa, make it stop thundering.'‘<br><br> ‘And--and Mother? Did she know Yankees were in the house?’<br><br> ‘She--never knew anything.’<br><br> ‘Thank God,’ said Scarlett. Mother was spared that. Mother never<br> knew, never heard the enemy in the rooms below, never heard the<br> guns at Jonesboro, never learned that the land which was part of<br> her heart was under Yankee feet.<br><br> ‘I saw few of them for I stayed upstairs with the girls and your<br> mother. I saw the young surgeon mostly. He was kind, so kind,<br> Scarlett. After he'd worked all day with the wounded, he came and<br> sat with them. He even left some medicine. He told me when they<br> moved on that the girls would recover but your mother-- She was so<br> frail, he said--too frail to stand it all. He said she had<br> undermined her strength. . . .’<br><br> In the silence that fell, Scarlett saw her mother as she must have<br> been in those last days, a thin power of strength in Tara, nursing,<br> working, doing without sleep and food that the others might rest<br> and eat.<br><br> ‘And then, they moved on. Then, they moved on.’<br><br> He was silent for a long time and then fumbled at her hand.<br><br> ‘It's glad I am you are home,’ he said simply.<br><br> There was a scraping noise on the back porch. Poor Pork, trained<br> for forty years to clean his shoes before entering the house, did<br> not forget, even in a time like this. He came in, carefully<br> carrying two gourds, and the strong smell of dripping spirits<br> entered before him.<br><br> ‘Ah spilt a plen'y, Miss Scarlett. It's pow'ful hard ter po' outer<br> a bung hole inter a go'de.’<br><br> ‘That's quite all right, Pork, and thank you.’ She took the wet<br> gourd dipper from him, her nostrils wrinkling in distaste at the<br> reek.<br><br> ‘Drink this, Father,’ she said, pushing the whisky in its strange<br> receptacle into his hand and taking the second gourd of water from<br> Pork. Gerald raised it, obedient as a child, and gulped noisily.<br> She handed the water to him but he shook his head.<br><br> As she took the whisky from him and held it to her mouth, she saw<br> his eyes follow her, a vague stirring of disapproval in them.<br><br> ‘I know no lady drinks spirits,’ she said briefly. ‘But today I'm<br> no lady, Pa, and there is work to do tonight.’<br><br> She tilted the dipper, drew a deep breath and drank swiftly. The<br> hot liquid burned down her throat to her stomach, choking her and<br> bringing tears to her eyes. She drew another breath and raised it<br> again.<br><br> ‘Katie Scarlett,’ said Gerald, the first note of authority she had<br> heard in his voice since her return, ‘that is enough. You're not<br> knowing spirits and they will be making you tipsy.’<br><br> ‘Tipsy?’ She laughed an ugly laugh. ‘Tipsy? I hope it makes me<br> drunk. I would like to be drunk and forget all of this.’<br><br> She drank again, a slow train of warmth lighting in her veins and<br> stealing through her body until even her finger tips tingled. What<br> a blessed feeling, this kindly fire. It seemed to penetrate even<br> her ice-locked heart and strength came coursing back into her body.<br> Seeing Gerald's puzzled hurt face, she patted his knee again and<br> managed an imitation of the pert smile he used to love.<br><br> ‘How could it make me tipsy, Pa? I'm your daughter. Haven't I<br> inherited the steadiest head in Clayton County?’<br><br> He almost smiled into her tired face. The whisky was bracing him<br> too. She handed it back to him.<br><br> ‘Now you're going to take another drink and then I am going to take<br> you upstairs and put you to bed.’<br><br> She caught herself. Why, this was the way she talked to Wade--she<br> should not address her father like this. It was disrespectful.<br> But he hung on her words.<br><br> ‘Yes, put you to bed,’ she added lightly, ‘and give you another<br> drink--maybe all the dipper and make you go to sleep. You need<br> sleep and Katie Scarlett is here, so you need not worry about<br> anything. Drink.’<br><br> He drank again obediently and, slipping her arm through his, she<br> pulled him to his feet.<br><br> ‘Pork. . . .’<br><br> Pork took the gourd in one hand and Gerald's arm in the other.<br> Scarlett picked up the flaring candle and the three walked slowly<br> into the dark hall and up the winding steps toward Gerald's room.<br><br> The room where Suellen and Carreen lay mumbling and tossing on the<br> same bed stank vilely with the smell of the twisted rag burning in<br> a saucer of bacon fat, which provided the only light. When<br> Scarlett first opened the door the thick atmosphere of the room,<br> with all windows closed and the air reeking with sick-room odors,<br> medicine smells and stinking grease, almost made her faint.<br> Doctors might say that fresh air was fatal in a sick room but if<br> she were to sit here, she must have air or die. She opened the<br> three windows, bringing in the smell of oak leaves and earth, but<br> the fresh air could do little toward dispelling the sickening odors<br> which had accumulated for weeks in this close room.<br><br> Carreen and Suellen, emaciated and white, slept brokenly and awoke<br> to mumble with wide, staring eyes in the tall four-poster bed where<br> they had whispered together in better, happier days. In the corner<br> of the room was an empty bed, a narrow French Empire bed with<br> curling head and foot, a bed which Ellen had brought from Savannah.<br> This was where Ellen had lain.<br><br> Scarlett sat beside the two girls, staring at them stupidly. The<br> whisky taken on a stomach long empty was playing tricks on her.<br> Sometimes her sisters seemed far away and tiny and their incoherent<br> voices came to her like the buzz of insects. And again, they<br> loomed large, rushing at her with lightning speed. She was tired,<br> tired to the bone. She could lie down and sleep for days.<br><br> If she could only lie down and sleep and wake to feel Ellen gently<br> shaking her arm and saying: ‘It is late, Scarlett. You must not<br> be so lazy.’ But she could not ever do that again. If there were<br> only Ellen, someone older than she, wiser and unweary, to whom she<br> could go! Someone in whose lap she could lay her head, someone on<br> whose shoulders she could rest her burdens!<br><br> The door opened softly and Dilcey entered, Melanie's baby held to<br> her breast, the gourd of whisky in her hand. In the smoky,<br> uncertain light, she seemed thinner than when Scarlett last saw her<br> and the Indian blood was more evident in her face. The high cheek<br> bones were more prominent, the hawk-bridged nose was sharper and<br> her copper skin gleamed with a brighter hue. Her faded calico<br> dress was open to the waist and her large bronze breast exposed.<br> Held close against her, Melanie's baby pressed his pale rosebud<br> mouth greedily to the dark nipple, sucking, gripping tiny fists<br> against the soft flesh like a kitten in the warm fur of its<br> mother's belly.<br><br> Scarlett rose unsteadily and put a hand on Dilcey's arm.<br><br> ‘It was good of you to stay, Dilcey.’<br><br> ‘How could I go off wid them trashy niggers, Miss Scarlett, after<br> yo' pa been so good to buy me and my little Prissy and yo' ma been<br> so kine?’<br><br> ‘Sit down, Dilcey. The baby can eat all right, then? And how is<br> Miss Melanie?’<br><br> ‘Nuthin' wrong wid this chile 'cept he hongry, and whut it take to<br> feed a hongry chile I got. No'm, Miss Melanie is all right. She<br> ain' gwine die, Miss Scarlett. Doan you fret yo'seff. I seen too<br> many, white and black, lak her. She mighty tired and nervous like<br> and scared fo' this baby. But I hesh her and give her some of whut<br> was lef' in that go'de and she sleepin'.’<br><br> So the corn whisky had been used by the whole family! Scarlett<br> thought hysterically that perhaps she had better give a drink to<br> little Wade and see if it would stop his hiccoughs-- And Melanie<br> would not die. And when Ashley came home--if he did come home . . .<br> No, she would think of that later too. So much to think of--<br> later! So many things to unravel--to decide. If only she could<br> put off the hour of reckoning forever! She started suddenly as a<br> creaking noise and a rhythmic ‘Ker-bunk--ker-bunk--’ broke the<br> stillness of the air outside.<br><br> ‘That's Mammy gettin' the water to sponge off the young Misses.<br> They takes a heap of bathin',’ explained Dilcey, propping the gourd<br> on the table between medicine bottles and a glass.<br><br> Scarlett laughed suddenly. Her nerves must be shredded if the<br> noise of the well windlass, bound up in her earliest memories,<br> could frighten her. Dilcey looked at her steadily as she laughed,<br> her face immobile in its dignity, but Scarlett felt that Dilcey<br> understood. She sank back in her chair. If she could only be rid<br> of her tight stays, the collar that choked her and the slippers<br> still full of sand and gravel that blistered her feet.<br><br> The windlass creaked slowly as the rope wound up, each creak<br> bringing the bucket nearer the top. Soon Mammy would be with her--<br> Ellen's Mammy, her Mammy. She sat silent, intent on nothing, while<br> the baby, already glutted with milk, whimpered because he had lost<br> the friendly nipple. Dilcey, silent too, guided the child's mouth<br> back, quieting him in her arms as Scarlett listened to the slow<br> scuffing of Mammy's feet across the back yard. How still the night<br> air was! The slightest sounds roared in her ears.<br><br> The upstairs hall seemed to shake as Mammy's ponderous weight came<br> toward the door. Then Mammy was in the room, Mammy with shoulders<br> dragged down by two heavy wooden buckets, her kind black face sad<br> with the uncomprehending sadness of a monkey's face.<br><br> Her eyes lighted up at the sight of Scarlett, her white teeth<br> gleamed as she set down the buckets, and Scarlett ran to her,<br> laying her head on the broad, sagging breasts which had held so<br> many heads, black and white. Here was something of stability,<br> thought Scarlett, something of the old life that was unchanging.<br> But Mammy's first words dispelled this illusion.<br><br> ‘Mammy's chile is home! Oh, Miss Scarlett, now dat Miss Ellen's in<br> de grabe, whut is we gwine ter do? Oh, Miss Scarlett, effen Ah wuz<br> jes' daid longside Miss Ellen! Ah kain make out widout Miss Ellen.<br> Ain' nuthin' lef' now but mizry an' trouble. Jes' weery loads,<br> honey, jes' weery loads.’<br><br> As Scarlett lay with her head hugged close to Mammy's breast, two<br> words caught her attention, ‘weery loads.’ Those were the words<br> which had hummed in her brain that afternoon so monotonously they<br> had sickened her. Now, she remembered the rest of the song,<br> remembered with a sinking heart:<br><br> <br> ‘Just a few more days for to tote the weary load!<br> No matter, 'twill never be light!<br> Just a few more days till we totter in the road--’<br><br> <br> ‘No matter, 'twill never be light’--she took the words to her tired<br> mind. Would her load never be light? Was coming home to Tara to<br> mean, not blessed surcease, but only more loads to carry? She<br> slipped from Mammy's arms and, reaching up, patted the wrinkled<br> black face.<br><br> ‘Honey, yo' han's!’ Mammy took the small hands with their blisters<br> and blood clots in hers and looked at them with horrified<br> disapproval. ‘Miss Scarlett, Ah done tole you an' tole you dat you<br> kin allus tell a lady by her han's an'--yo' face sunbuhnt too!’<br><br> Poor Mammy, still the martinet about such unimportant things even<br> though war and death had just passed over her head! In another<br> moment she would be saying that young Misses with blistered hands<br> and freckles most generally didn't never catch husbands and<br> Scarlett forestalled the remark.<br><br> ‘Mammy, I want you to tell me about Mother. I couldn't bear to<br> hear Pa talk about her.’<br><br> Tears started from Mammy's eyes as she leaned down to pick up the<br> buckets. In silence she carried them to the bedside and, turning<br> down the sheet, began pulling up the night clothes of Suellen and<br> Carreen. Scarlett, peering at her sisters in the dim flaring<br> light, saw that Carreen wore a nightgown, clean but in tatters, and<br> Suellen lay wrapped in an old negligee, a brown linen garment heavy<br> with tagging ends of Irish lace. Mammy cried silently as she<br> sponged the gaunt bodies, using the remnant of an old apron as a<br> cloth.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, it wuz dem Slatterys, dem trashy, no-good, low-down<br> po'-w'ite Slatterys dat kilt Miss Ellen. Ah done tole her an' tole<br> her it doan do no good doin' things fer trashy folks, but Miss<br> Ellen wuz so sot in her ways an' her heart so sof' she couldn'<br> never say no ter nobody whut needed her.’<br><br> ‘Slatterys?’ questioned Scarlett, bewildered. ‘How do they come<br> in?’<br><br> ‘Dey wuz sick wid disyere thing,’ Mammy gestured with her rag to<br> the two naked girls, dripping with water on their damp sheet. ‘Ole<br> Miss Slattery's gal, Emmie, come down wid it an' Miss Slattery come<br> hotfootin' it up hyah affer Miss Ellen, lak she allus done w'en<br> anything wrong. Why din' she nuss her own? Miss Ellen had mo'n<br> she could tote anyways. But Miss Ellen she went down dar an' she<br> nuss Emmie. An' Miss Ellen wuzn' well a-tall herseff, Miss<br> Scarlett. Yo' ma hadn' been well fer de longes'. Dey ain' been<br> too much ter eat roun' hyah, wid de commissary stealin' eve'y thing<br> us growed. An' Miss Ellen eat lak a bird anyways. An' Ah tole her<br> an' tole her ter let dem w'ite trash alone, but she din' pay me no<br> mine. Well'm, 'bout de time Emmie look lak she gittin' better,<br> Miss Carreen come down wid it. Yas'm, de typhoy fly right up de<br> road an' ketch Miss Carreen, an' den down come Miss Suellen. So<br> Miss Ellen, she tuck an' nuss dem too.<br><br> ‘Wid all de fightin' up de road an' de Yankees 'cross de river an'<br> us not knowin' whut wuz gwine ter happen ter us an' de fe'el han's<br> runnin' off eve'y night, Ah's 'bout crazy. But Miss Ellen jes' as<br> cool as a cucumber. 'Cept she wuz worried ter a ghos' 'bout de<br> young Misses kase we couldn' git no medicines nor nuthin'. An' one<br> night she say ter me affer we done sponge off de young Misses 'bout<br> ten times, she say, 'Mammy, effen Ah could sell mah soul, Ah'd sell<br> it fer some ice ter put on mah gals' haids.'<br><br> ‘She wouldn't let Mist' Gerald come in hyah, nor Rosa nor Teena,<br> nobody but me, kase Ah done had de typhoy. An' den it tuck her,<br> Miss Scarlett, an' Ah seed right off dat 'twarnt no use.’<br><br> Mammy straightened up and, raising her apron, dried her streaming<br> eyes.<br><br> ‘She went fas', Miss Scarlett, an' even dat nice Yankee doctah<br> couldn' do nuthin' fer her. She din' know nuthin' a-tall. Ah call<br> ter her an' talk ter her but she din' even know her own Mammy.’<br><br> ‘Did she--did she ever mention me--call for me?’<br><br> ‘No, honey. She think she is lil gal back in Savannah. She din'<br> call nobody by name.’<br><br> Dilcey stirred and laid the sleeping baby across her knees.<br><br> ‘Yes'm, she did. She did call somebody.’<br><br> ‘You hesh yo' mouf, you Injun-nigger!’ Mammy turned with<br> threatening violence on Dilcey.<br><br> ‘Hush, Mammy! Who did she call, Dilcey? Pa?’<br><br> ‘No'm. Not yo' pa. It wuz the night the cotton buhnt--’<br><br> ‘Has the cotton gone--tell me quickly!’<br><br> ‘Yes'm, it buhnt up. The sojers rolls it out of the shed into the<br> back yard and hollers, 'Here the bigges' bonfiah in Georgia,' and<br> tech it off.’<br><br> Three years of stored cotton--one hundred and fifty thousand<br> dollars, all in one blaze!<br><br> ‘And the fiah light up the place lak it wuz day--we wuz scared the<br> house would buhn, too, and it wuz so bright in this hyah room that<br> you could mos' pick a needle offen the flo'. And w'en the light<br> shine in the winder, it look lak it wake Miss Ellen up and she set<br> right up in bed and cry out loud, time and again: 'Feeleep!<br> Feeleep!' I ain' never heerd no sech name but it wuz a name and<br> she wuz callin' him.’<br><br> Mammy stood as though turned to stone glaring at Dilcey but<br> Scarlett dropped her head into her hands. Philippe--who was he and<br> what had he been to Mother that she died calling him?<br><br> <br><br> The long road from Atlanta to Tara had ended, ended in a blank<br> wall, the road that was to end in Ellen's arms. Never again could<br> Scarlett lie down, as a child, secure beneath her father's roof<br> with the protection of her mother's love wrapped about her like an<br> eiderdown quilt. There was no security or haven to which she could<br> turn now. No turning or twisting would avoid this dead end to<br> which she had come. There was no one on whose shoulders she could<br> rest her burdens. Her father was old and stunned, her sisters ill,<br> Melanie frail and weak, the children helpless, and the negroes<br> looking up to her with childlike faith, clinging to her skirts,<br> knowing that Ellen's daughter would be the refuge Ellen had always<br> been.<br><br> Through the window, in the faint light of the rising moon, Tara<br> stretched before her, negroes gone, acres desolate, barns ruined,<br> like a body bleeding under her eyes, like her own body, slowly<br> bleeding. This was the end of the road, quivering old age,<br> sickness, hungry mouths, helpless hands plucking at her skirts.<br> And at the end of this road, there was nothing--nothing but<br> Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton, nineteen years old, a widow with a little<br> child.<br><br> What would she do with all of this? Aunt Pitty and the Burrs in<br> Macon could take Melanie and her baby. If the girls recovered,<br> Ellen's family would have to take them, whether they liked it or<br> not. And she and Gerald could turn to Uncle James and Andrew.<br><br> She looked at the thin forms, tossing before her, the sheets about<br> them moist and dark from dripping water. She did not like Suellen.<br> She saw it now with a sudden clarity. She had never liked her.<br> She did not especially love Carreen--she could not love anyone who<br> was weak. But they were of her blood, part of Tara. No, she could<br> not let them live out their lives in their aunts' homes as poor<br> relations. An O'Hara a poor relation, living on charity bread and<br> sufferance! Oh, never that!<br><br> Was there no escape from this dead end? Her tired brain moved so<br> slowly. She raised her hands to her head as wearily as if the air<br> were water against which her arms struggled. She took the gourd<br> from between the glass and bottle and looked in it. There was some<br> whisky left in the bottom, how much she could not tell in the<br> uncertain light. Strange that the sharp smell did not offend her<br> nostrils now. She drank slowly but this time the liquid did not<br> burn, only a dull warmth followed.<br><br> She set down the empty gourd and looked about her. This was all a<br> dream, this smoke-filled dim room, the scrawny girls, Mammy<br> shapeless and huge crouching beside the bed, Dilcey a still bronze<br> image with the sleeping pink morsel against her dark breast--all a<br> dream from which she would awake, to smell bacon frying in the<br> kitchen, hear the throaty laughter of the negroes and the creaking<br> of wagons fieldward bound, and Ellen's gentle insistent hand upon<br> her.<br><br> Then she discovered she was in her own room, on her own bed, faint<br> moonlight pricking the darkness, and Mammy and Dilcey were<br> undressing her. The torturing stays no longer pinched her waist<br> and she could breathe deeply and quietly to the bottom of her lungs<br> and her abdomen. She felt her stockings being stripped gently from<br> her and heard Mammy murmuring indistinguishable comforting sounds<br> as she bathed her blistered feet. How cool the water was, how good<br> to lie here in softness, like a child. She sighed and relaxed and<br> after a time which might have been a year or a second, she was<br> alone and the room was brighter as the rays of the moon streamed in<br> across the bed.<br><br> She did not know she was drunk, drunk with fatigue and whisky. She<br> only knew she had left her tired body and floated somewhere above<br> it where there was no pain and weariness and her brain saw things<br> with an inhuman clarity.<br><br> She was seeing things with new eyes for, somewhere along the long<br> road to Tara, she had left her girlhood behind her. She was no<br> longer plastic clay, yielding imprint to each new experience. The<br> clay had hardened, some time in this indeterminate day which had<br> lasted a thousand years. Tonight was the last time she would ever<br> be ministered to as a child. She was a woman now and youth was<br> gone.<br><br> No, she could not, would not, turn to Gerald's or Ellen's families.<br> The O'Haras did not take charity. The O'Haras looked after their<br> own. Her burdens were her own and burdens were for shoulders<br> strong enough to bear them. She thought without surprise, looking<br> down from her height, that her shoulders were strong enough to bear<br> anything now, having borne the worst that could ever happen to her.<br> She could not desert Tara; she belonged to the red acres far more<br> than they could ever belong to her. Her roots went deep into the<br> blood-colored soil and sucked up life, as did the cotton. She<br> would stay at Tara and keep it, somehow, keep her father and her<br> sisters, Melanie and Ashley's child, the negroes. Tomorrow--oh,<br> tomorrow! Tomorrow she would fit the yoke about her neck.<br> Tomorrow there would be so many things to do. Go to Twelve Oaks<br> and the MacIntosh place and see if anything was left in the<br> deserted gardens, go to the river swamps and beat them for straying<br> hogs and chickens, go to Jonesboro and Lovejoy with Ellen's<br> jewelry--there must be someone left there who would sell something<br> to eat. Tomorrow--tomorrow--her brain ticked slowly and more<br> slowly, like a clock running down, but the clarity of vision<br> persisted.<br><br> Of a sudden, the oft-told family tales to which she had listened<br> since babyhood, listened half-bored, impatient and but partly<br> comprehending, were crystal clear. Gerald, penniless, had raised<br> Tara; Ellen had risen above some mysterious sorrow; Grandfather<br> Robillard, surviving the wreck of Napoleon's throne, had founded<br> his fortunes anew on the fertile Georgia coast; Great-grandfather<br> Prudhomme had carved a small kingdom out of the dark jungles of<br> Haiti, lost it, and lived to see his name honored in Savannah.<br> There were the Scarletts who had fought with the Irish Volunteers<br> for a free Ireland and been hanged for their pains and the O'Haras<br> who died at the Boyne, battling to the end for what was theirs.<br><br> All had suffered crushing misfortunes and had not been crushed.<br> They had not been broken by the crash of empires, the machetes of<br> revolting slaves, war, rebellion, proscription, confiscation.<br> Malign fate had broken their necks, perhaps, but never their<br> hearts. They had not whined, they had fought. And when they died,<br> they died spent but unquenched. All of those shadowy folks whose<br> blood flowed in her veins seemed to move quietly in the moonlit<br> room. And Scarlett was not surprised to see them, these kinsmen<br> who had taken the worst that fate could send and hammered it into<br> the best. Tara was her fate, her fight, and she must conquer it.<br><br> She turned drowsily on her side, a slow creeping blackness<br> enveloping her mind. Were they really there, whispering wordless<br> encouragement to her, or was this part of her dream?<br><br> ‘Whether you are there or not,’ she murmured sleepily, ‘good night--<br> and thank you.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXV<br><br> <br> The next morning Scarlett's body was so stiff and sore from the<br> long miles of walking and jolting in the wagon that every movement<br> was agony. Her face was crimson with sunburn and her blistered<br> palms raw. Her tongue was furred and her throat parched as if<br> flames had scorched it and no amount of water could assuage her<br> thirst. Her head felt swollen and she winced even when she turned<br> her eyes. A queasiness of the stomach reminiscent of the early<br> days of her pregnancy made the smoking yams on the breakfast table<br> unendurable, even to the smell. Gerald could have told her she was<br> suffering the normal aftermath of her first experience with hard<br> drinking but Gerald noticed nothing. He sat at the head of the<br> table, a gray old man with absent, faded eyes fastened on the door<br> and head cocked slightly to hear the rustle of Ellen's petticoats,<br> to smell the lemon verbena sachet.<br><br> As Scarlett sat down, he mumbled: ‘We will wait for Mrs. O'Hara.<br> She is late.’ She raised an aching head, looked at him with<br> startled incredulity and met the pleading eyes of Mammy, who stood<br> behind Gerald's chair. She rose unsteadily, her hand at her throat<br> and looked down at her father in the morning sunlight. He peered<br> up at her vaguely and she saw that his hands were shaking, that his<br> head trembled a little.<br><br> Until this moment she had not realized how much she had counted on<br> Gerald to take command, to tell her what she must do, and now--<br> Why, last night he had seemed almost himself. There had been none<br> of his usual bluster and vitality, but at least he had told a<br> connected story and now--now, he did not even remember Ellen was<br> dead. The combined shock of the coming of the Yankees and her<br> death had stunned him. She started to speak, but Mammy shook her<br> head vehemently and raising her apron dabbed at her red eyes.<br><br> ‘Oh, can Pa have lost his mind?’ thought Scarlett and her throbbing<br> head felt as if it would crack with this added strain. ‘No, no.<br> He's just dazed by it all. It's like he was sick. He'll get over<br> it. He must get over it. What will I do if he doesn't?--I won't<br> think about it now. I won't think of him or Mother or any of these<br> awful things now. No, not till I can stand it. There are too many<br> other things to think about--things that can be helped without my<br> thinking of those I can't help.’<br><br> She left the dining room without eating, and went out onto the back<br> porch where she found Pork, barefooted and in the ragged remains of<br> his best livery, sitting on the steps cracking peanuts. Her head<br> was hammering and throbbing and the bright, sunlight stabbed into<br> her eyes. Merely holding herself erect required an effort of will<br> power and she talked as briefly as possible, dispensing with the<br> usual forms of courtesy her mother had always taught her to use<br> with negroes.<br><br> She began asking questions so brusquely and giving orders so<br> decisively Pork's eyebrows went up in mystification. Miss Ellen<br> didn't never talk so short to nobody, not even when she caught them<br> stealing pullets and watermelons. She asked again about the<br> fields, the gardens, the stock, and her green eyes had a hard<br> bright glaze which Pork had never seen in them before.<br><br> ‘Yas'm, dat hawse daid, lyin' dar whar Ah tie him wid his nose in<br> de water bucket he tuhned over. No'm, de cow ain' daid. Din' you<br> know? She done have a calf las' night. Dat why she beller so.’<br><br> ‘A fine midwife your Prissy will make,’ Scarlett remarked<br> caustically. ‘She said she was bellowing because she needed<br> milking.’<br><br> ‘Well'm, Prissy ain' fixin' ter be no cow midwife, Miss Scarlett,’<br> Pork said tactfully. ‘An' ain' no use quarrelin' wid blessin's,<br> 'cause dat calf gwine ter mean a full cow an' plen'y buttermilk fer<br> de young Misses, lak dat Yankee doctah say dey' need.’<br><br> ‘All right, go on. Any stock left?’<br><br> ‘No'm. Nuthin' 'cept one ole sow an' her litter. Ah driv dem<br> inter de swamp de day de Yankees come, but de Lawd knows how we<br> gwine git dem. She mean, dat sow.’<br><br> ‘We'll get them all right. You and Prissy can start right now<br> hunting for her.’<br><br> Pork was amazed and indignant.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, dat a fe'el han's bizness. Ah's allus been a house<br> nigger.’<br><br> A small fiend with a pair of hot tweezers plucked behind Scarlett's<br> eyeballs.<br><br> ‘You two will catch the sow--or get out of here, like the field<br> hands did.’<br><br> Tears trembled in Pork's hurt eyes. Oh, if only Miss Ellen was<br> here! She understood such niceties and realized the wide gap<br> between the duties of a field hand and those of a house nigger.<br><br> ‘Git out, Miss Scarlett? Whar'd Ah git out to, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘I don't know and I don't care. But anyone at Tara who won't work<br> can go hunt up the Yankees. You can tell the others that too.’<br><br> ‘Now, what about the corn and the cotton, Pork?’<br><br> ‘De cawn? Lawd, Miss Scarlett, dey pasture dey hawses in de cawn<br> an' cah'ied off whut de hawses din' eat or spile. An' dey driv dey<br> cannons an' waggins 'cross de cotton till it plum ruint, 'cept a<br> few acres over on de creek bottom dat dey din' notice. But dat<br> cotton ain' wuth foolin' wid, 'cause ain' but 'bout three bales<br> over dar.’<br><br> Three bales. Scarlett thought of the scores of bales Tara usually<br> yielded and her head hurt worse. Three bales. That was little<br> more than the shiftless Slatterys raised. To make matters worse,<br> there was the question of taxes. The Confederate government took<br> cotton for taxes in lieu of money, but three bales wouldn't even<br> cover the taxes. Little did it matter though, to her or the<br> Confederacy, now that all the field hands had run away and there<br> was no one to pick the cotton.<br><br> ‘Well, I won't think of that either,’ she told herself. ‘Taxes<br> aren't a woman's job anyway. Pa ought to look after such things,<br> but Pa-- I won't think of Pa now. The Confederacy can whistle for<br> its taxes. What we need now is something to eat.’<br><br> ‘Pork, have any of you been to Twelve Oaks or the MacIntosh place<br> to see if there's anything left in the gardens there?’<br><br> ‘No, Ma'm! Us ain' lef' Tara. De Yankees mout git us.’<br><br> ‘I'll send Dilcey over to MacIntosh. Perhaps she'll find something<br> there. And I'll go to Twelve Oaks.’<br><br> ‘Who wid, chile?’<br><br> ‘By myself. Mammy must stay with the girls and Mr. Gerald can't--’<br><br> Pork set up an outcry which she found infuriating. There might be<br> Yankees or mean niggers at Twelve Oaks. She mustn't go alone.<br><br> ‘That will be enough, Pork. Tell Dilcey to start immediately. And<br> you and Prissy go bring in the sow and her litter,’ she said<br> briefly, turning on her heel.<br><br> Mammy's old sunbonnet, faded but clean, hung on its peg on the back<br> porch and Scarlett put it on her head, remembering, as from another<br> world, the bonnet with the curling green plume which Rhett had<br> brought her from Paris. She picked up a large split-oak basket and<br> started down the back stairs, each step jouncing her head until her<br> spine seemed to be trying to crash through the top of her skull.<br><br> The road down to the river lay red and scorching between the ruined<br> cotton fields. There were no trees to cast a shade and the sun<br> beat down through Mammy's sunbonnet as if it were made of tarlatan<br> instead of heavy quilted calico, while the dust floating upward<br> sifted into her nose and throat until she felt the membranes would<br> crack dryly if she spoke. Deep ruts and furrows were cut into the<br> road where horses had dragged heavy guns along it and the red<br> gullies on either side were deeply gashed by the wheels. The<br> cotton was mangled and trampled where cavalry and infantry, forced<br> off the narrow road by the artillery, had marched through the green<br> bushes, grinding them into the earth. Here and there in the road<br> and fields lay buckles and bits of harness leather, canteens<br> flattened by hooves and caisson wheels, buttons, blue caps, worn<br> socks, bits of bloody rags, all the litter left by the marching<br> army.<br><br> She passed the clump of cedars and the low brick wall which marked<br> the family burying ground, trying not to think of the new grave<br> lying by the three short mounds of her little brothers. Oh, Ellen--<br> She trudged on down the dusty hill, passing the heap of ashes<br> and the stumpy chimney where the Slattery house had stood, and she<br> wished savagely that the whole tribe of them had been part of the<br> ashes. If it hadn't been for the Slatterys--if it hadn't been for<br> that nasty Emmie who'd had a bastard brat by their overseer--Ellen<br> wouldn't have died.<br><br> She moaned as a sharp pebble cut into her blistered foot. What was<br> she doing here? Why was Scarlett O'Hara, the belle of the County,<br> the sheltered pride of Tara, tramping down this rough road almost<br> barefoot? Her little feet were made to dance, not to limp, her<br> tiny slippers to peep daringly from under bright silks, not to<br> collect sharp pebbles and dust. She was born to be pampered and<br> waited upon, and here she was, sick and ragged, driven by hunger to<br> hunt for food in the gardens of her neighbors.<br><br> At the bottom of the long hill was the river and how cool and still<br> were the tangled trees overhanging the water! She sank down on the<br> low bank, and stripping off the remnants of her slippers and<br> stockings, dabbled her burning feet in the cool water. It would be<br> so good to sit here all day, away from the helpless eyes of Tara,<br> here where only the rustle of leaves and the gurgle of slow water<br> broke the stillness. But reluctantly she replaced her shoes and<br> stockings and trudged down the bank, spongy with moss, under the<br> shady trees. The Yankees had burned the bridge but she knew of a<br> footlog bridge across a narrow point of the stream a hundred yards<br> below. She crossed it cautiously and trudged uphill the hot half-<br> mile to Twelve Oaks.<br><br> There towered the twelve oaks, as they had stood since Indian days,<br> but with their leaves brown from fire and the branches burned and<br> scorched. Within their circle lay the ruins of John Wilkes' house,<br> the charred remains of that once stately home which had crowned the<br> hill in white-columned dignity. The deep pit which had been the<br> cellar, the blackened field-stone foundations and two mighty<br> chimneys marked the site. One long column, half-burned, had fallen<br> across the lawn, crushing the cape jessamine bushes.<br><br> Scarlett sat down on the column, too sick at the sight to go on.<br> This desolation went to her heart as nothing she had ever<br> experienced. Here was the Wilkes pride in the dust at her feet.<br> Here was the end of the kindly, courteous house which had always<br> welcomed her, the house where in futile dreams she had aspired to<br> be mistress. Here she had danced and dined and flirted and here<br> she had watched with a jealous, hurting heart how Melanie smiled up<br> at Ashley. Here, too, in the cool shadows of the trees, Charles<br> Hamilton had rapturously pressed her hand when she said she would<br> marry him.<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley,’ she thought, ‘I hope you are dead! I could never<br> bear for you to see this.’<br><br> Ashley had married his bride here but his son and his son's son<br> would never bring brides to this house. There would be no more<br> matings and births beneath this roof which she had so loved and<br> longed to rule. The house was dead and to Scarlett, it was as if<br> all the Wilkeses, too, were dead in its ashes.<br><br> ‘I won't think of it now. I can't stand it now. I'll think of it<br> later,’ she said aloud, turning her eyes away.<br><br> Seeking the garden, she limped around the ruins, by the trampled<br> rose beds the Wilkes girls had tended so zealously, across the back<br> yard and through the ashes to the smokehouse, barns and chicken<br> houses. The split-rail fence around the kitchen garden had been<br> demolished and the once orderly rows of green plants had suffered<br> the same treatment as those at Tara. The soft earth was scarred<br> with hoof prints and heavy wheels and the vegetables were mashed<br> into the soil. There was nothing for her here.<br><br> She walked back across the yard and took the path down toward the<br> silent row of whitewashed cabins in the quarters, calling ‘Hello!’<br> as she went. But no voice answered her. Not even a dog barked.<br> Evidently the Wilkes negroes had taken flight or followed the<br> Yankees. She knew every slave had his own garden patch and as she<br> reached the quarters, she hoped these little patches had been<br> spared.<br><br> Her search was rewarded but she was too tired even to feel pleasure<br> at the sight of turnips and cabbages, wilted for want of water but<br> still standing, and straggling butter beans and snap beans, yellow<br> but edible. She sat down in the furrows and dug into the earth<br> with hands that shook, filling her basket slowly. There would be a<br> good meal at Tara tonight, in spite of the lack of side meat to<br> boil with the vegetables. Perhaps some of the bacon grease Dilcey<br> was using for illumination could be used for seasoning. She must<br> remember to tell Dilcey to use pine knots and save the grease for<br> cooking.<br><br> Close to the back step of one cabin, she found a short row of<br> radishes and hunger assaulted her suddenly. A spicy, sharp-tasting<br> radish was exactly what her stomach craved. Hardly waiting to rub<br> the dirt off on her skirt, she bit off half and swallowed it<br> hastily. It was old and coarse and so peppery that tears started<br> in her eyes. No sooner had the lump gone down than her empty<br> outraged stomach revolted and she lay in the soft dirt and vomited<br> tiredly.<br><br> The faint niggery smell which crept from the cabin increased her<br> nausea and, without strength to combat it, she kept on retching<br> miserably while the cabins and trees revolved swiftly around her.<br><br> After a long time, she lay weakly on her face, the earth as soft<br> and comfortable as a feather pillow, and her mind wandered feebly<br> here and there. She, Scarlett O'Hara was lying behind a negro<br> cabin, in the midst of ruins, too sick and too weak to move, and no<br> one in the world knew or cared. No one would care if they did<br> know, for everyone had too many troubles of his own to worry about<br> her. And all this was happening to her, Scarlett O'Hara, who had<br> never raised her hand even to pick up her discarded stockings from<br> the floor or to tie the laces of her slippers--Scarlett, whose<br> little headaches and tempers had been coddled and catered to all<br> her life.<br><br> As she lay prostrate, too weak to fight off memories and worries,<br> they rushed at her like buzzards waiting for death. No longer had<br> she the strength to say: ‘I'll think of Mother and Pa and Ashley<br> and all this ruin later-- Yes, later when I can stand it.’ She<br> could not stand it now, but she was thinking of them whether she<br> willed it or not. The thoughts circled and swooped above her,<br> dived down and drove tearing claws and sharp beaks into her mind.<br> For a timeless time, she lay still, her face in the dirt, the sun<br> beating hotly upon her, remembering things and people who were<br> dead, remembering a way of living that was gone forever--and<br> looking upon the harsh vista of the dark future.<br><br> When she arose at last and saw again the black ruins of Twelve<br> Oaks, her head was raised high and something that was youth and<br> beauty and potential tenderness had gone out of her face forever.<br> What was past was past. Those who were dead were dead. The lazy<br> luxury of the old days was gone, never to return. And, as Scarlett<br> settled the heavy basket across her arm, she had settled her own<br> mind and her own life.<br><br> There was no going back and she was going forward.<br><br> Throughout the South for fifty years there would be bitter-eyed<br> women who looked backward, to dead times, to dead men, evoking<br> memories that hurt and were futile, bearing poverty with bitter<br> pride because they had those memories. But Scarlett was never to<br> look back.<br><br> She gazed at the blackened stones and, for the last time, she saw<br> Twelve Oaks rise before her eyes as it had once stood, rich and<br> proud, symbol of a race and a way of living. Then she started down<br> the road toward Tara, the heavy basket cutting into her flesh.<br><br> Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again and she said aloud: ‘As<br> God is my witness, as God is my witness, the Yankees aren't going<br> to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's over,<br> I'm never going to be hungry again. No, nor any of my folks. If I<br> have to steal or kill--as God is my witness, I'm never going to be<br> hungry again.’<br><br> <br><br> In the days that followed, Tara might have been Crusoe's desert<br> island, so still it was, so isolated from the rest of the world.<br> The world lay only a few miles away, but a thousand miles of<br> tumbling waves might have stretched between Tara and Jonesboro and<br> Fayetteville and Lovejoy, even between Tara and the neighbors'<br> plantations. With the old horse dead, their one mode of conveyance<br> was gone, and there was neither time nor strength for walking the<br> weary red miles.<br><br> Sometimes, in the days of backbreaking work, in the desperate<br> struggle for food and the never-ceasing care of the three sick<br> girls, Scarlett found herself straining her ears for familiar<br> sounds--the shrill laughter of the pickaninnies in the quarters,<br> the creaking of wagons home from the fields, the thunder of<br> Gerald's stallion tearing across the pasture, the crunching of<br> carriage wheels on the drive and the gay voices of neighbors<br> dropping in for an afternoon of gossip. But she listened in vain.<br> The road lay still and deserted and never a cloud of red dust<br> proclaimed the approach of visitors. Tara was an island in a sea<br> of rolling green hills and red fields.<br><br> Somewhere was the world and families who ate and slept safely under<br> their own roofs. Somewhere girls in thrice-turned dresses were<br> flirting gaily and singing ‘When This Cruel War Is Over,’ as she<br> had done only a few weeks before. Somewhere there was a war and<br> cannon booming and burning towns and men who rotted in hospitals<br> amid sickening-sweet stinks. Somewhere a barefoot army in dirty<br> homespun was marching, fighting, sleeping, hungry and weary with<br> the weariness that comes when hope is gone. And somewhere the<br> hills of Georgia were blue with Yankees, well-fed Yankees on sleek<br> corn-stuffed horses.<br><br> Beyond Tara was the war and the world. But on the plantation the<br> war and the world did not exist except as memories which must be<br> fought back when they rushed to mind in moments of exhaustion. The<br> world outside receded before the demands of empty and half-empty<br> stomachs and life resolved itself into two related thoughts, food<br> and how to get it.<br><br> Food! Food! Why did the stomach have a longer memory than the<br> mind? Scarlett could banish heartbreak but not hunger and each<br> morning as she lay half asleep, before memory brought back to her<br> mind war and hunger, she curled drowsily expecting the sweet smells<br> of bacon frying and rolls baking. And each morning she sniffed so<br> hard to really smell the food she woke herself up.<br><br> There were apples, yams, peanuts and milk on the table at Tara but<br> never enough of even this primitive fare. At the sight of them,<br> three times a day, her memory would rush back to the old days, the<br> meals of the old days, the candle-lit table and the food perfuming<br> the air.<br><br> How careless they had been of food then, what prodigal waste!<br> Rolls, corn muffins, biscuits and waffles, dripping butter, all at<br> one meal. Ham at one end of the table and fried chicken at the<br> other, collards swimming richly in pot liquor iridescent with<br> grease, snap beans in mountains on brightly flowered porcelain,<br> fried squash, stewed okra, carrots in cream sauce thick enough to<br> cut. And three desserts, so everyone might have his choice,<br> chocolate layer cake, vanilla blanc mange and pound cake topped<br> with sweet whipped cream. The memory of those savory meals had the<br> power to bring tears to her eyes as death and war had failed to do,<br> and the power to turn her ever-gnawing stomach from rumbling<br> emptiness to nausea. For the appetite Mammy had always deplored,<br> the healthy appetite of a nineteen-year-old girl, now was increased<br> fourfold by the hard and unremitting labor she had never known<br> before.<br><br> Hers was not the only troublesome appetite at Tara, for wherever<br> she turned hungry faces, black and white, met her eyes. Soon<br> Carreen and Suellen would have the insatiable hunger of typhoid<br> convalescents. Already little Wade whined monotonously: ‘Wade<br> doan like yams. Wade hungwy.’<br><br> The others grumbled, too:<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, 'ness I gits mo' to eat, I kain nuss neither of<br> these chillun.’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, ef Ah doan have mo' in mah stummick, Ah kain split<br> no wood.’<br><br> ‘Lamb, Ah's perishin' fer real vittles.’<br><br> ‘Daughter, must we always have yams?’<br><br> Only Melanie did not complain, Melanie whose face grew thinner and<br> whiter and twitched with pain even in her sleep.<br><br> ‘I'm not hungry, Scarlett. Give my share of the milk to Dilcey.<br> She needs it to nurse the babies. Sick people are never hungry.’<br><br> It was her gentle hardihood which irritated Scarlett more than the<br> nagging whining voices of the others. She could--and did--shout<br> them down with bitter sarcasm but before Melanie's unselfishness<br> she was helpless, helpless and resentful. Gerald, the negroes and<br> Wade clung to Melanie now, because even in her weakness she was<br> kind and sympathetic, and these days Scarlett was neither.<br><br> Wade especially haunted Melanie's room. There was something wrong<br> with Wade, but just what it was Scarlett had no time to discover.<br> She took Mammy's word that the little boy had worms and dosed him<br> with the mixture of dried herbs and bark which Ellen always used to<br> worm the pickaninnies. But the vermifuge only made the child look<br> paler. These days Scarlett hardly thought of Wade as a person. He<br> was only another worry, another mouth to feed. Some day when the<br> present emergency was over, she would play with him, tell him<br> stories and teach him his A B C's but now she did not have the time<br> or the soul or the inclination. And, because he always seemed<br> underfoot when she was most weary and worried, she often spoke<br> sharply to him.<br><br> It annoyed her that her quick reprimands brought such acute fright<br> to his round eyes, for he looked so simple minded when he was<br> frightened. She did not realize that the little boy lived shoulder<br> to shoulder with terror too great for an adult to comprehend. Fear<br> lived with Wade, fear that shook his soul and made him wake<br> screaming in the night. Any unexpected noise or sharp word set him<br> to trembling, for in his mind noises and harsh words were<br> inextricably mixed with Yankees and he was more afraid of Yankees<br> than of Prissy's hants.<br><br> Until the thunders of the siege began, he had never known anything<br> but a happy, placid, quiet life. Even though his mother paid him<br> little attention, he had known nothing but petting and kind words<br> until the night when he was jerked from slumber to find the sky<br> aflame and the air deafening with explosions. In that night and<br> the day which followed, he had been slapped by his mother for the<br> first time and had heard her voice raised at him in harsh words.<br> Life in the pleasant brick house on Peachtree Street, the only life<br> he knew, had vanished that night and he would never recover from<br> its loss. In the flight from Atlanta, he had understood nothing<br> except that the Yankees were after him and now he still lived in<br> fear that the Yankees would catch him and cut him to pieces.<br> Whenever Scarlett raised her voice in reproof, he went weak with<br> fright as his vague childish memory brought up the horrors of the<br> first time she had ever done it. Now, Yankees and a cross voice<br> were linked forever in his mind and he was afraid of his mother.<br><br> Scarlett could not help noticing that the child was beginning to<br> avoid her and, in the rare moments when her unending duties gave<br> her time to think about it, it bothered her a great deal. It was<br> even worse than having him at her skirts all the time and she was<br> offended that his refuge was Melanie's bed where he played quietly<br> at games Melanie suggested or listened to stories she told. Wade<br> adored ‘Auntee’ who had a gentle voice, who always smiled and who<br> never said: ‘Hush, Wade! You give me a headache’ or ‘Stop<br> fidgeting, Wade, for Heaven's sake!’<br><br> Scarlett had neither the time nor the impulse to pet him but it<br> made her jealous to see Melanie do it. When she found him one day<br> standing on his head in Melanie's bed and saw him collapse on her,<br> she slapped him.<br><br> ‘Don't you know better than to jiggle Auntee like that when she's<br> sick? Now, trot right out in the yard and play, and don't come in<br> here again.’<br><br> But Melanie reached out a weak arm and drew the wailing child to<br> her.<br><br> ‘There, there, Wade. You didn't mean to jiggle me, did you? He<br> doesn't bother me, Scarlett. Do let him stay with me. Let me take<br> care of him. It's the only thing I can do till I get well, and<br> you've got your hands full enough without having to watch him.’<br><br> ‘Don't be a goose, Melly,’ said Scarlett shortly. ‘You aren't<br> getting well like you should and having Wade fall on your stomach<br> won't help you. Now, Wade, if I ever catch you on Auntee's bed<br> again, I'll wear you out. And stop sniffling. You are always<br> sniffling. Try to be a little man.’<br><br> Wade flew sobbing to hide himself under the house. Melanie bit her<br> lip and tears came to her eyes, and Mammy standing in the hall, a<br> witness to the scene, scowled and breathed hard. But no one talked<br> back to Scarlett these days. They were all afraid of her sharp<br> tongue, all afraid of the new person who walked in her body.<br><br> Scarlett reigned supreme at Tara now and, like others suddenly<br> elevated to authority, all the bullying instincts in her nature<br> rose to the surface. It was not that she was basically unkind. It<br> was because she was so frightened and unsure of herself she was<br> harsh lest others learn her inadequacies and refuse her authority.<br> Besides, there was some pleasure in shouting at people and knowing<br> they were afraid. Scarlett found that it relieved her overwrought<br> nerves. She was not blind to the fact that her personality was<br> changing. Sometimes when her curt orders made Pork stick out his<br> under lip and Mammy mutter: ‘Some folks rides mighty high dese<br> days,’ she wondered where her good manners had gone. All the<br> courtesy, all the gentleness Ellen had striven to instill in her<br> had fallen away from her as quickly as leaves fall from trees in<br> the first chill wind of autumn.<br><br> Time and again, Ellen had said: ‘Be firm but be gentle with<br> inferiors, especially darkies.’ But if she was gentle the darkies<br> would sit in the kitchen all day, talking endlessly about the good<br> old days when a house nigger wasn't supposed to do a field hand's<br> work.<br><br> ‘Love and cherish your sisters. Be kind to the afflicted,’ said<br> Ellen. ‘Show tenderness to those in sorrow and in trouble.’<br><br> She couldn't love her sisters now. They were simply a dead weight<br> on her shoulders. And as for cherishing them, wasn't she bathing<br> them, combing their hair and feeding them, even at the expense of<br> walking miles every day to find vegetables? Wasn't she learning to<br> milk the cow, even though her heart was always in her throat when<br> that fearsome animal shook its horns at her? And as for being<br> kind, that was a waste of time. If she was overly kind to them,<br> they'd probably prolong their stay in bed, and she wanted them on<br> their feet again as soon as possible, so there would be four more<br> hands to help her.<br><br> They were convalescing slowly and lay scrawny and weak in their<br> bed. While they had been unconscious, the world had changed. The<br> Yankees had come, the darkies had gone and Mother had died. Here<br> were three unbelievable happenings and their minds could not take<br> them in. Sometimes they believed they must still be delirious and<br> these things had not happened at all. Certainly Scarlett was so<br> changed she couldn't be real. When she hung over the foot of their<br> bed and outlined the work she expected them to do when they<br> recovered, they looked at her as if she were a hobgoblin. It was<br> beyond their comprehension that they no longer had a hundred slaves<br> to do the work. It was beyond their comprehension that an O'Hara<br> lady should do manual labor.<br><br> ‘But, Sister,’ said Carreen, her sweet childish face blank with<br> consternation. ‘I couldn't split kindling! It would ruin my<br> hands!’<br><br> ‘Look at mine,’ answered Scarlett with a frightening smile as she<br> pushed blistered and calloused palms toward her.<br><br> ‘I think you are hateful to talk to Baby and me like this!’ cried<br> Suellen. ‘I think you are lying and trying to frighten us. If<br> Mother were only here, she wouldn't let you talk to us like this!<br> Split kindling, indeed!’<br><br> Suellen looked with weak loathing at her older sister, feeling sure<br> Scarlett said these things just to be mean. Suellen had nearly<br> died and she had lost her mother and she was lonely and scared and<br> she wanted to be petted and made much of. Instead, Scarlett looked<br> over the foot of the bed each day, appraising their improvement<br> with a hateful new gleam in her slanting green eyes and talked<br> about making beds, preparing food, carrying water buckets and<br> splitting kindling. And she looked as if she took a pleasure in<br> saying such awful things.<br><br> Scarlett did take pleasure in it. She bullied the negroes and<br> harrowed the feelings of her sisters not only because she was too<br> worried and strained and tired to do otherwise but because it<br> helped her to forget her own bitterness that everything her mother<br> had told her about life was wrong.<br><br> Nothing her mother had taught her was of any value whatsoever now<br> and Scarlett's heart was sore and puzzled. It did not occur to her<br> that Ellen could not have foreseen the collapse of the civilization<br> in which she raised her daughters, could not have anticipated the<br> disappearings of the places in society for which she trained them<br> so well. It did not occur to her that Ellen had looked down a<br> vista of placid future years, all like the uneventful years of her<br> own life, when she had taught her to be gentle and gracious,<br> honorable and kind, modest and truthful. Life treated women well<br> when they had learned those lessons, said Ellen.<br><br> Scarlett thought in despair: ‘Nothing, no, nothing, she taught me<br> is of any help to me! What good will kindness do me now? What<br> value is gentleness? Better that I'd learned to plow or chop<br> cotton like a darky. Oh, Mother, you were wrong!’<br><br> She did not stop to think that Ellen's ordered world was gone and a<br> brutal world had taken its place, a world wherein every standard,<br> every value had changed. She only saw, or thought she saw, that<br> her mother had been wrong, and she changed swiftly to meet this new<br> world for which she was not prepared.<br><br> Only her feeling for Tara had not changed. She never came wearily<br> home across the fields and saw the sprawling white house that her<br> heart did not swell with love and the joy of homecoming. She never<br> looked out of her window at green pastures and red fields and tall<br> tangled swamp forest that a sense of beauty did not fill her. Her<br> love for this land with its softly rolling hills of bright-red<br> soil, this beautiful red earth that was blood colored, garnet,<br> brick dust, vermilion, which so miraculously grew green bushes<br> starred with white puffs, was one part of Scarlett which did not<br> change when all else was changing. Nowhere else in the world was<br> there land like this.<br><br> When she looked at Tara she could understand, in part, why wars<br> were fought. Rhett was wrong when he said men fought wars for<br> money. No, they fought for swelling acres, softly furrowed by the<br> plow, for pastures green with stubby cropped grass, for lazy yellow<br> rivers and white houses that were cool amid magnolias. These were<br> the only things worth fighting for, the red earth which was theirs<br> and would be their sons', the red earth which would bear cotton for<br> their sons and their sons' sons.<br><br> The trampled acres of Tara were all that was left to her, now that<br> Mother and Ashley were gone, now that Gerald was senile from shock,<br> and money and darkies and security and position had vanished<br> overnight. As from another world she remembered a conversation<br> with her father about the land and wondered how she could have been<br> so young, so ignorant, as not to understand what he meant when he<br> said that the land was the one thing in the world worth fighting<br> for.<br><br> ‘For 'tis the only thing in the world that lasts . . . and to<br> anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them the land they live on is<br> like their mother. . . . 'Tis the only thing worth working for,<br> fighting for, dying for.’<br><br> Yes, Tara was worth fighting for, and she accepted simply and<br> without question the fight. No one was going to get Tara away from<br> her. No one was going to set her and her people adrift on the<br> charity of relatives. She would hold Tara, if she had to break the<br> back of every person on it.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXVI<br><br> <br> Scarlett had been at Tara two weeks since her return from Atlanta<br> when the largest blister on her foot began to fester, swelling<br> until it was impossible for her to put on her shoe or do more than<br> hobble about on her heel. Desperation plucked at her when she<br> looked at the angry sore on her toe. Suppose it should gangrene<br> like the soldiers' wounds and she should die, far away from a<br> doctor? Bitter as life was now, she had no desire to leave it.<br> And who would look after Tara if she should die?<br><br> She had hoped when she first came home that Gerald's old spirit<br> would revive and he would take command, but in these two weeks that<br> hope had vanished. She knew now that, whether she liked it or not,<br> she had the plantation and all its people on her two inexperienced<br> hands, for Gerald still sat quietly, like a man in a dream, so<br> frighteningly absent from Tara, so gentle. To her pleas for advice<br> he gave as his only answer: ‘Do what you think best, Daughter.’<br> Or worse still, ‘Consult with your mother, Puss.’<br><br> He never would be any different and now Scarlett realized the truth<br> and accepted it without emotion--that until he died Gerald would<br> always be waiting for Ellen, always listening for her. He was in<br> some dim borderline country where time was standing still and Ellen<br> was always in the next room. The mainspring of his existence was<br> taken away when she died and with it had gone his bounding<br> assurance, his impudence and his restless vitality. Ellen was the<br> audience before which the blustering drama of Gerald O'Hara had<br> been played. Now the curtain had been rung down forever, the<br> footlights dimmed and the audience suddenly vanished, while the<br> stunned old actor remained on his empty stage, waiting for his<br> cues.<br><br> That morning the house was still, for everyone except Scarlett,<br> Wade and the three sick girls was in the swamp hunting the sow.<br> Even Gerald had aroused a little and stumped off across the<br> furrowed fields, one hand on Pork's arm and a coil of rope in the<br> other. Suellen and Careen had cried themselves to sleep, as they<br> did at least twice a day when they thought of Ellen, tears of grief<br> and weakness oozing down their sunken cheeks. Melanie, who had<br> been propped up on pillows for the first time that day, lay covered<br> with a mended sheet between two babies, the downy flaxen head of<br> one cuddled in her arm, the kinky black head of Dilcey's child held<br> as gently in the other. Wade sat at the bottom of the bed,<br> listening to a fairy story.<br><br> To Scarlett, the stillness at Tara was unbearable, for it reminded<br> her too sharply of the deathlike stillness of the desolate country<br> through which she had passed that long day on her way home from<br> Atlanta. The cow and the calf had made no sound for hours. There<br> were no birds twittering outside her window and even the noisy<br> family of mockers who had lived among the harshly rustling leaves<br> of the magnolia for generations had no song that day. She had<br> drawn a low chair close to the open window of her bedroom, looking<br> out on the front drive, the lawn and the empty green pasture across<br> the road, and she sat with her skirts well above her knees and her<br> chin resting on her arms on the window sill. There was a bucket of<br> well water on the floor beside her and every now and then she<br> lowered her blistered foot into it, screwing up her face at the<br> stinging sensation.<br><br> Fretting, she dug her chin into her arm. Just when she needed her<br> strength most, this toe had to fester. Those fools would never<br> catch the sow. It had taken them a week to capture the pigs, one<br> by one, and now after two weeks the sow was still at liberty.<br> Scarlett knew that if she were just there in the swamp with them,<br> she could tuck up her dress to her knees and take the rope and<br> lasso the sow before you could say Jack Robinson.<br><br> But even after the sow was caught--if she were caught? What then,<br> after she and her litter were eaten? Life would go on and so would<br> appetites. Winter was coming and there would be no food, not even<br> the poor remnants of the vegetables from the neighbors' gardens.<br> They must have dried peas and sorghum and meal and rice and--and--<br> oh, so many things. Corn and cotton seed for next spring's<br> planting, and new clothes too. Where was it all to come from and<br> how would she pay for it?<br><br> She had privately gone through Gerald's pockets and his cash box<br> and all she could find was stacks of Confederate bonds and three<br> thousand dollars in Confederate bills. That was about enough to<br> buy one square meal for them all, she thought ironically, now that<br> Confederate money was worth almost less than nothing at all. But<br> if she did have money and could find food, how would she haul it<br> home to Tara? Why had God let the old horse die? Even that sorry<br> animal Rhett had stolen would make all the difference in the world<br> to them. Oh, those fine sleek mules which used to kick up their<br> heels in the pasture across the road, and the handsome carriage<br> horses, her little mare, the girls' ponies and Gerald's big<br> stallion racing about and tearing up the turf-- Oh, for one of<br> them, even the balkiest mule!<br><br> But, no matter--when her foot healed she would walk to Jonesboro.<br> It would be the longest walk she had ever taken in her life, but<br> walk it she would. Even if the Yankees had burned the town<br> completely, she would certainly find someone in the neighborhood<br> who could tell her where to get food. Wade's pinched face rose up<br> before her eyes. He didn't like yams, he repeated; wanted a<br> drumstick and some rice and gravy.<br><br> The bright sunlight in the front yard suddenly clouded and the<br> trees blurred through tears. Scarlett dropped her head on her arms<br> and struggled not to cry. Crying was so useless now. The only<br> time crying ever did any good was when there was a man around from<br> whom you wished favors. As she crouched there, squeezing her eyes<br> tightly to keep back the tears, she was startled by the sound of<br> trotting hooves. But she did not raise her head. She had imagined<br> that sound too often in the nights and days of these last two<br> weeks, just as she had imagined she heard the rustle of Ellen's<br> skirts. Her heart hammered, as it always did at such moments,<br> before she told herself sternly: ‘Don't be a fool.’<br><br> But the hooves slowed down in a startlingly natural way to the<br> rhythm of a walk and there was the measured scrunch-scrunch on the<br> gravel. It was a horse--the Tarletons, the Fontaines! She looked<br> up quickly. It was a Yankee cavalryman.<br><br> Automatically, she dodged behind the curtain and peered fascinated<br> at him through the dim folds of the cloth, so startled that the<br> breath went out of her lungs with a gasp.<br><br> He sat slouched in the saddle, a thick, rough-looking man with an<br> unkempt black beard straggling over his unbuttoned blue jacket.<br> Little close-set eyes, squinting in the sun glare, calmly surveyed<br> the house from beneath the visor of his tight blue cap. As he<br> slowly dismounted and tossed the bridle reins over the hitching<br> post, Scarlett's breath came back to her as suddenly and painfully<br> as after a blow in the stomach. A Yankee, a Yankee with a long<br> pistol on his hip! And she was alone in the house with three sick<br> girls and the babies!<br><br> As he lounged up the walk, hand on holster, beady little eyes<br> glancing to right and left, a kaleidoscope of jumbled pictures spun<br> in her mind, stories Aunt Pittypat had whispered of attacks on<br> unprotected women, throat cuttings, houses burned over the heads of<br> dying women, children bayoneted because they cried, all of the<br> unspeakable horrors that lay bound up in the name of ‘Yankee.’<br><br> Her first terrified impulse was to hide in the closet, crawl under<br> the bed, fly down the back stairs and run screaming to the swamp,<br> anything to escape him. Then she heard his cautious feet on the<br> front steps and his stealthy tread as he entered the hall and she<br> knew that escape was cut off. Too cold with fear to move, she<br> heard his progress from room to room downstairs, his steps growing<br> louder and bolder as he discovered no one. Now he was in the<br> dining room and in a moment he would walk out into the kitchen.<br><br> At the thought of the kitchen, rage suddenly leaped up in<br> Scarlett's breast, so sharply that it jabbed at her heart like a<br> knife thrust, and fear fell away before her overpowering fury. The<br> kitchen! There, over the open kitchen fire were two pots, one<br> filled with apples stewing and the other with a hodgepodge of<br> vegetables brought painfully from Twelve Oaks and the MacIntosh<br> garden--dinner that must serve for nine hungry people and hardly<br> enough for two. Scarlett had been restraining her appetite for<br> hours, waiting for the return of the others and the thought of the<br> Yankee eating their meager meal made her shake with anger.<br><br> God damn them all! They descended like locusts and left Tara to<br> starve slowly and now they were back again to steal the poor<br> leavings. Her empty stomach writhed within her. By God, this was<br> one Yankee who would do no more stealing!<br><br> She slipped off her worn shoe and, barefooted, she pattered swiftly<br> to the bureau, not even feeling her festered toe. She opened the<br> top drawer soundlessly and caught up the heavy pistol she had<br> brought from Atlanta, the weapon Charles had worn but never fired.<br> She fumbled in the leather box that hung on the wall below his<br> saber and brought out a cap. She slipped it into place with a hand<br> that did not shake. Quickly and noiselessly, she ran into the<br> upper hall and down the stairs, steadying herself on the banisters<br> with one hand and holding the pistol close to her thigh in the<br> folds of her skirt.<br><br> ‘Who's there?’ cried a nasal voice and she stopped on the middle of<br> the stairs, the blood thudding in her ears so loudly she could<br> hardly hear him. ‘Halt or I'll shoot!’ came the voice.<br><br> He stood in the door of the dining room, crouched tensely, his<br> pistol in one hand and, in the other, the small rosewood sewing box<br> fitted with gold thimble, gold-handled scissors and tiny gold-<br> topped acorn of emery. Scarlett's legs felt cold to the knees but<br> rage scorched her face. Ellen's sewing box in his hands. She<br> wanted to cry: ‘Put it down! Put it down, you dirty--’ but words<br> would not come. She could only stare over the banisters at him and<br> watch his face change from harsh tenseness to a half-contemptuous,<br> half-ingratiating smile.<br><br> ‘So there is somebody ter home,’ he said, slipping his pistol back<br> into its holster and moving into the hall until he stood directly<br> below her. ‘All alone, little lady?’<br><br> Like lightning, she shoved her weapon over the banisters and into<br> the startled bearded face. Before he could even fumble at his<br> belt, she pulled the trigger. The back kick of the pistol made her<br> reel, as the roar of the explosion filled her ears and the acrid<br> smoke stung her nostrils. The man crashed backwards to the floor,<br> sprawling into the dining room with a violence that shook the<br> furniture. The box clattered from his hand, the contents spilling<br> about him. Hardly aware that she was moving, Scarlett ran down the<br> stairs and stood over him, gazing down into what was left of the<br> face above the beard, a bloody pit where the nose had been, glazing<br> eyes burned with powder. As she looked, two streams of blood crept<br> across the shining floor, one from his face and one from the back<br> of his head.<br><br> Yes, he was dead. Undoubtedly. She had killed a man.<br><br> The smoke curled slowly to the ceiling and the red streams widened<br> about her feet. For a timeless moment she stood there and in the<br> still hot hush of the summer morning every irrelevant sound and<br> scent seemed magnified, the quick thudding of her heart, like a<br> drumbeat, the slight rough rustling of the magnolia leaves, the<br> far-off plaintive sound of a swamp bird and the sweet smell of the<br> flowers outside the window.<br><br> She had killed a man, she who took care never to be in at the kill<br> on a hunt, she who could not bear the squealing of a hog at<br> slaughter or the squeak of a rabbit in a snare. Murder! she<br> thought dully. I've done murder. Oh, this can't be happening to<br> me! Her eyes went to the stubby hairy hand on the floor so close<br> to the sewing box and suddenly she was vitally alive again, vitally<br> glad with a cool tigerish joy. She could have ground her heel into<br> the gaping wound which had been his nose and taken sweet pleasure<br> in the feel of his warm blood on her bare feet. She had struck a<br> blow of revenge for Tara--and for Ellen.<br><br> There were hurried stumbling steps in the upper hall, a pause and<br> then more steps, weak dragging steps now, punctuated by metallic<br> clankings. A sense of time and reality coming back to her,<br> Scarlett looked up and saw Melanie at the top of the stairs, clad<br> only in the ragged chemise which served her as a nightgown, her<br> weak arm weighed down with Charles' saber. Melanie's eyes took in<br> the scene below in its entirety, the sprawling blue-clad body in<br> the red pool, the sewing box beside him, Scarlett, barefooted and<br> gray-faced, clutching the long pistol.<br><br> In silence her eyes met Scarlett's. There was a glow of grim pride<br> in her usually gentle face, approbation and a fierce joy in her<br> smile that equaled the fiery tumult in Scarlett's own bosom.<br><br> ‘Why--why--she's like me! She understands how I feel!’ thought<br> Scarlett in that long moment. ‘She'd have done the same thing!’<br><br> With a thrill she looked up at the frail swaying girl for whom she<br> had never had any feelings but of dislike and contempt. Now,<br> struggling against hatred for Ashley's wife, there surged a feeling<br> of admiration and comradeship. She saw in a flash of clarity<br> untouched by any petty emotion that beneath the gentle voice and<br> the dovelike eyes of Melanie there was a thin flashing blade of<br> unbreakable steel, felt too that there were banners and bugles of<br> courage in Melanie's quiet blood.<br><br> ‘Scarlett! Scarlett!’ shrilled the weak frightened voices of<br> Suellen and Carreen, muffled by their closed door, and Wade's voice<br> screamed ‘Auntee! Auntee!’ Swiftly Melanie put her finger to her<br> lips and, laying the sword on the top step, she painfully made her<br> way down the upstairs hall and opened the door of the sick room.<br><br> ‘Don't be scared, chickens!’ came her voice with teasing gaiety.<br> ‘Your big sister was trying to clean the rust off Charles' pistol<br> and it went off and nearly scared her to death!’ . . . ‘Now, Wade<br> Hampton, Mama just shot off your dear Papa's pistol! When you are<br> bigger, she will let you shoot it.’<br><br> ‘What a cool liar!’ thought Scarlett with admiration. ‘I couldn't<br> have thought that quickly. But why lie? They've got to know I've<br> done it.’<br><br> She looked down at the body again and now revulsion came over her<br> as her rage and fright melted away, and her knees began to quiver<br> with the reaction. Melanie dragged herself to the top step again<br> and started down, holding onto the banisters, her pale lower lip<br> caught between her teeth.<br><br> ‘Go back to bed, silly, you'll kill yourself!’ Scarlett cried, but<br> the half-naked Melanie made her painful way down into the lower<br> hall.<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ she whispered, ‘we must get him out of here and bury<br> him. He may not be alone and if they find him here--’ She<br> steadied herself on Scarlett's arm.<br><br> ‘He must be alone,’ said Scarlett. ‘I didn't see anyone else from<br> the upstairs window. He must be a deserter.’<br><br> ‘Even if he is alone, no one must know about it. The negroes might<br> talk and then they'd come and get you. Scarlett, we must get him<br> hidden before the folks come back from the swamp.’<br><br> Her mind prodded to action by the feverish urgency of Melanie's<br> voice, Scarlett thought hard.<br><br> ‘I could bury him in the corner of the garden under the arbor--the<br> ground is soft there where Pork dug up the whisky barrel. But how<br> will I get him there?’<br><br> ‘We'll both take a leg and drag him,’ said Melanie firmly.<br><br> Reluctantly, Scarlett's admiration went still higher.<br><br> ‘You couldn't drag a cat. I'll drag him,’ she said roughly. ‘You<br> go back to bed. You'll kill yourself. Don't dare try to help me<br> either or I'll carry you upstairs myself.’<br><br> Melanie's white face broke into a sweet understanding smile. ‘You<br> are very dear, Scarlett,’ she said and softly brushed her lips<br> against Scarlett's cheek. Before Scarlett could recover from her<br> surprise, Melanie went on: ‘If you can drag him out, I'll mop up<br> the--the mess before the folks get home, and Scarlett--’<br><br> ‘Yes?’<br><br> ‘Do you suppose it would be dishonest to go through his knapsack?<br> He might have something to eat.’<br><br> ‘I do not,’ said Scarlett, annoyed that she had not thought of this<br> herself. ‘You take the knapsack and I'll go through his pockets.’<br><br> Stooping over the dead man with distaste, she unbuttoned the<br> remaining buttons of his jacket and systematically began rifling<br> his pockets.<br><br> ‘Dear God,’ she whispered, pulling out a bulging wallet, wrapped<br> about with a rag. ‘Melanie--Melly, I think it's full of money!’<br><br> Melanie said nothing but abruptly sat down on the floor and leaned<br> back against the wall.<br><br> ‘You look,’ she said shakily. ‘I'm feeling a little weak.’<br><br> Scarlett tore off the rag and with trembling hands opened the<br> leather folds.<br><br> ‘Look, Melly--just look!’<br><br> Melanie looked and her eyes dilated. Jumbled together was a mass<br> of bills, United States greenbacks mingling with Confederate money<br> and, glinting from between them, were one ten-dollar gold piece and<br> two five-dollar gold pieces.<br><br> ‘Don't stop to count it now,’ said Melanie as Scarlett began<br> fingering the bills. ‘We haven't time--’<br><br> ‘Do you realize, Melanie, that this money means that we'll eat?’<br><br> ‘Yes, yes, dear. I know but we haven't time now. You look in his<br> other pockets and I'll take the knapsack.’<br><br> Scarlett was loath to put down the wallet. Bright vistas opened<br> before her--real money, the Yankee's horse, food! There was a God<br> after all, and He did provide, even if He did take very odd ways of<br> providing. She sat on her haunches and stared at the wallet<br> smiling. Food! Melanie plucked it from her hands--<br><br> ‘Hurry!’ she said.<br><br> The trouser pockets yielded nothing except a candle end, a<br> jackknife, a plug of tobacco and a bit of twine. Melanie removed<br> from the knapsack a small package of coffee which she sniffed as if<br> it were the sweetest of perfumes, hardtack and, her face changing,<br> a miniature of a little girl in a gold frame set with seed pearls,<br> a garnet brooch, two broad gold bracelets with tiny dangling gold<br> chains, a gold thimble, a small silver baby's cup, gold embroidery<br> scissors, a diamond solitaire ring and a pair of earrings with<br> pendant pear-shaped diamonds, which even their unpracticed eyes<br> could tell were well over a carat each.<br><br> ‘A thief!’ whispered Melanie, recoiling from the still body.<br> ‘Scarlett, he must have stolen all of this!’<br><br> ‘Of course,’ said Scarlett. ‘And he came here hoping to steal more<br> from us.’<br><br> ‘I'm glad you killed him,’ said Melanie her gentle eyes hard. ‘Now<br> hurry, darling, and get him out of here.’<br><br> Scarlett bent over, caught the dead man by his boots and tugged.<br> How heavy he was and how weak she suddenly felt. Suppose she<br> shouldn't be able to move him? Turning so that she backed the<br> corpse, she caught a heavy boot under each arm and threw her weight<br> forward. He moved and she jerked again. Her sore foot, forgotten<br> in the excitement, now gave a tremendous throb that made her grit<br> her teeth and shift her weight to the heel. Tugging and straining,<br> perspiration dripping from her forehead, she dragged him down the<br> hall, a red stain following her path.<br><br> ‘If he bleeds across the yard, we can't hide it,’ she gasped.<br> ‘Give me your shimmy, Melanie, and I'll wad it around his head.’<br><br> Melanie's white face went crimson.<br><br> ‘Don't be silly, I won't look at you,’ said Scarlett. ‘If I had on<br> a petticoat or pantalets I'd use them.’<br><br> Crouching back against the wall, Melanie pulled the ragged linen<br> garment over her head and silently tossed it to Scarlett, shielding<br> herself as best she could with her arms.<br><br> ‘Thank God, I'm not that modest,’ thought Scarlett, feeling rather<br> than seeing Melanie's agony of embarrassment, as she wrapped the<br> ragged cloth about the shattered face.<br><br> By a series of limping jerks, she pulled the body down the hall<br> toward the back porch and, pausing to wipe her forehead with the<br> back of her hand, glanced back toward Melanie, sitting against the<br> wall hugging her thin knees to her bare breasts. How silly of<br> Melanie to be bothering about modesty at a time like this, Scarlett<br> thought irritably. It was just part of her nicey-nice way of<br> acting which had always made Scarlett despise her. Then shame rose<br> in her. After all--after all, Melanie had dragged herself from bed<br> so soon after having a baby and had come to her aid with a weapon<br> too heavy even for her to lift. That had taken courage, the kind<br> of courage Scarlett honestly knew she herself did not possess, the<br> thin-steel, spun-silk courage which had characterized Melanie on<br> the terrible night Atlanta fell and on the long trip home. It was<br> the same intangible, unspectacular courage that all the Wilkeses<br> possessed, a quality which Scarlett did not understand but to which<br> she gave grudging tribute.<br><br> ‘Go back to bed,’ she threw over her shoulder. ‘You'll be dead if<br> you don't. I'll clean up the mess after I've buried him.’<br><br> ‘I'll do it with one of the rag rugs,’ whispered Melanie, looking<br> at the pool of blood with a sick face.<br><br> ‘Well, kill yourself then and see if I care! And if any of the<br> folks come back before I'm finished, keep them in the house and<br> tell them the horse just walked in from nowhere.’<br><br> Melanie sat shivering in the morning sunlight and covered her ears<br> against the sickening series of thuds as the dead man's head bumped<br> down the porch steps.<br><br> No one questioned whence the horse had come. It was so obvious he<br> was a stray from the recent battle and they were well pleased to<br> have him. The Yankee lay in the shallow pit Scarlett had scraped<br> out under the scuppernong arbor. The uprights which held the thick<br> vines were rotten and that night Scarlett hacked at them with the<br> kitchen knife until they fell and the tangled mass ran wild over<br> the grave. The replacing of these posts was one bit of repair work<br> Scarlett did not suggest and, if the negroes knew why, they kept<br> their silence.<br><br> No ghost rose from that shallow grave to haunt her in the long<br> nights when she lay awake, too tired to sleep. No feeling of<br> horror or remorse assailed her at the memory. She wondered why,<br> knowing that even a month before she could never have done the<br> deed. Pretty young Mrs. Hamilton, with her dimple and her jingling<br> earbobs and her helpless little ways, blowing a man's face to a<br> pulp and then burying him in a hastily scratched-out hole!<br> Scarlett grinned a little grimly thinking of the consternation such<br> an idea would bring to those who knew her.<br><br> ‘I won't think about it any more,’ she decided. ‘It's over and<br> done with and I'd have been a ninny not to kill him. I reckon--I<br> reckon I must have changed a little since coming home or else I<br> couldn't have done it.’<br><br> She did not think of it consciously but in the back of her mind,<br> whenever she was confronted by an unpleasant and difficult task,<br> the idea lurked giving her strength: ‘I've done murder and so I<br> can surely do this.’<br><br> She had changed more than she knew and the shell of hardness which<br> had begun to form about her heart when she lay in the slave garden<br> at Twelve Oaks was slowly thickening.<br><br> <br><br> Now that she had a horse, Scarlett could find out for herself what<br> had happened to their neighbors. Since she came home she had<br> wondered despairingly a thousand times: ‘Are we the only folks<br> left in the County? Has everybody else been burned out? Have they<br> all refugeed to Macon?’ With the memory of the ruins of Twelve<br> Oaks, the MacIntosh place and the Slattery shack fresh in her mind,<br> she almost dreaded to discover the truth. But it was better to<br> know the worst than to wonder. She decided to ride to the<br> Fontaines' first, not because they were the nearest neighbors but<br> because old Dr. Fontaine might be there. Melanie needed a doctor.<br> She was not recovering as she should and Scarlett was frightened by<br> her white weakness.<br><br> So on the first day when her foot had healed enough to stand a<br> slipper, she mounted the Yankee's horse. One foot in the shortened<br> stirrup and the other leg crooked about the pommel in an<br> approximation of a side saddle, she set out across the fields<br> toward Mimosa, steeling herself to find it burned.<br><br> To her surprise and pleasure, she saw the faded yellow-stucco house<br> standing amid the mimosa trees, looking as it had always looked.<br> Warm happiness, happiness that almost brought tears, flooded her<br> when the three Fontaine women came out of the house to welcome her<br> with kisses and cries of joy.<br><br> But when the first exclamations of affectionate greeting were over<br> and they all had trooped into the dining room to sit down, Scarlett<br> felt a chill. The Yankees had not reached Mimosa because it was<br> far off the main road. And so the Fontaines still had their stock<br> and their provisions, but Mimosa was held by the same strange<br> silence that hung over Tara, over the whole countryside. All the<br> slaves except four women house servants had run away, frightened by<br> the approach of the Yankees. There was not a man on the place<br> unless Sally's little boy, Joe, hardly out of diapers, could be<br> counted as a man. Alone in the big house were Grandma Fontaine, in<br> her seventies, her daughter-in-law who would always be known as<br> Young Miss, though she was in her fifties, and Sally, who had<br> barely turned twenty. They were far away from neighbors and<br> unprotected, but if they were afraid it did not show on their<br> faces. Probably, thought Scarlett, because Sally and Young Miss<br> were too afraid of the porcelain-frail but indomitable old Grandma<br> to dare voice any qualms. Scarlett herself was afraid of the old<br> lady, for she had sharp eyes and a sharper tongue and Scarlett had<br> felt them both in the past.<br><br> Though unrelated by blood and far apart in age, there was a kinship<br> of spirit and experience binding these women together. All three<br> wore home-dyed mourning, all were worn, sad, worried, all bitter<br> with a bitterness that did not sulk or complain but, nevertheless,<br> peered out from behind their smiles and their words of welcome.<br> For their slaves were gone, their money was worthless, Sally's<br> husband, Joe, had died at Gettysburg and Young Miss was also a<br> widow, for young Dr. Fontaine had died of dysentery at Vicksburg.<br> The other two boys, Alex and Tony, were somewhere in Virginia and<br> nobody knew whether they were alive or dead; and old Dr. Fontaine<br> was off somewhere with Wheeler's cavalry.<br><br> ‘And the old fool is seventy-three years old though he tries to act<br> younger and he's as full of rheumatism as a hog is of fleas,’ said<br> Grandma, proud of her husband, the light in her eyes belying her<br> sharp words.<br><br> ‘Have you all had any news of what's been happening in Atlanta?’<br> asked Scarlett when they were comfortably settled. ‘We're<br> completely buried at Tara.’<br><br> ‘Law, child,’ said Old Miss, taking charge of the conversation, as<br> was her habit, ‘we're in the same fix as you are. We don't know a<br> thing except that Sherman finally got the town.’<br><br> ‘So he did get it. What's he doing now? Where's the fighting<br> now?’<br><br> ‘And how would three lone women out here in the country know about<br> the war when we haven't seen a letter or a newspaper m weeks?’ said<br> the old lady tartly. ‘One of our darkies talked to a darky who'd<br> seen a darky who'd been to Jonesboro, and except for that we<br> haven't heard anything. What they said was that the Yankees were<br> just squatting in Atlanta resting up their men and their horses,<br> but whether it's true or not you're as good a judge as I am. Not<br> that they wouldn't need a rest, after the fight we gave them.’<br><br> ‘To think you've been at Tara all this time and we didn't know!’<br> Young Miss broke in. ‘Oh, how I blame myself for not riding over<br> to see! But there's been so much to do here with most all the<br> darkies gone that I just couldn't get away. But I should have made<br> time to go. It wasn't neighborly of me. But, of course, we<br> thought the Yankees had burned Tara like they did Twelve Oaks and<br> the MacIntosh house and that your folks had gone to Macon. And we<br> never dreamed you were home, Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘Well, how were we to know different when Mr. O'Hara's darkies came<br> through here so scared they were popeyed and told us the Yankees<br> were going to burn Tara?’ Grandma interrupted.<br><br> ‘And we could see--’ Sally began.<br><br> ‘I'm telling this, please,’ said Old Miss shortly. ‘And they said<br> the Yankees were camped all over Tara and your folks were fixing to<br> go to Macon. And then that night we saw the glare of fire over<br> toward Tara and it lasted for hours and it scared our fool darkies<br> so bad they all ran off. What burned?’<br><br> ‘All our cotton--a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth,’ said<br> Scarlett bitterly.<br><br> ‘Be thankful it wasn't your house,’ said Grandma, leaning her chin<br> on her cane. ‘You can always grow more cotton and you can't grow a<br> house. By the bye, had you all started picking your cotton?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Scarlett, ‘and now most of it is ruined. I don't<br> imagine there's more than three bales left standing, in the far<br> field in the creek bottom, and what earthly good will it do? All<br> our field hands are gone and there's nobody to pick it.’<br><br> ‘Mercy me, all our field hands are gone and there's nobody to pick<br> it!’ mimicked Grandma and bent a satiric glance on Scarlett.<br> ‘What's wrong with your own pretty paws, Miss, and those of your<br> sisters?’<br><br> ‘Me? Pick cotton?’ cried Scarlett aghast, as if Grandma had been<br> suggesting some repulsive crime. ‘Like a field hand? Like white<br> trash? Like the Slattery women?’<br><br> ‘White trash, indeed! Well, isn't this generation soft and<br> ladylike! Let me tell you, Miss, when I was a girl my father lost<br> all his money and I wasn't above doing honest work with my hands<br> and in the fields too, till Pa got enough money to buy some more<br> darkies. I've hoed my row and I've picked my cotton and I can do<br> it again if I have to. And it looks like I'll have to. White<br> trash, indeed!’<br><br> ‘Oh, but Mama Fontaine,’ cried her daughter-in-law, casting<br> imploring glances at the two girls, urging them to help her smooth<br> the old lady's feathers. ‘That was so long ago, a different day<br> entirely, and times have changed.’<br><br> ‘Times never change when there's a need for honest work to be<br> done,’ stated the sharp-eyed old lady, refusing to be soothed.<br> ‘And I'm ashamed for your mother, Scarlett, to hear you stand there<br> and talk as though honest work made white trash out of nice people.<br> 'When Adam delved and Eve span'--’<br><br> To change the subject, Scarlett hastily questioned: ‘What about<br> the Tarletons and the Calverts? Were they burned out? Have they<br> refugeed to Macon?’<br><br> ‘The Yankees never got to the Tarletons. They're off the main<br> road, like we are, but they did get to the Calverts and they stole<br> all their stock and poultry and got all the darkies to run off with<br> them--’ Sally began.<br><br> Grandma interrupted.<br><br> ‘Hah! They promised all the black wenches silk dresses and gold<br> earbobs--that's what they did. And Cathleen Calvert said some of<br> the troopers went off with the black fools behind them on their<br> saddles. Well, all they'll get will be yellow babies and I can't<br> say that Yankee blood will improve the stock.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Mama Fontaine!’<br><br> ‘Don't pull such a shocked face, Jane. We're all married, aren't<br> we? And, God knows, we've seen mulatto babies before this.’<br><br> ‘Why didn't they burn the Calverts' house?’<br><br> ‘The house was saved by the combined accents of the second Mrs.<br> Calvert and that Yankee overseer of hers, Hilton,’ said Old Miss,<br> who always referred to the ex-governess as the ‘second Mrs.<br> Calvert,’ although the first Mrs. Calvert had been dead twenty<br> years.<br><br> ‘'We are staunch Union sympathizers,'‘ mimicked the old lady,<br> twanging the words through her long thin nose. ‘Cathleen said the<br> two of them swore up hill and down dale that the whole passel of<br> Calverts were Yankees. And Mr. Calvert dead in the Wilderness!<br> And Raiford at Gettysburg and Cade in Virginia with the army!<br> Cathleen was so mortified she said she'd rather the house had been<br> burned. She said Cade would bust when he came home and heard about<br> it. But then, that's what a man gets for marrying a Yankee woman--<br> no pride, no decency, always thinking about their own skins. . . .<br> How come they didn't burn Tara, Scarlett?’<br><br> For a moment Scarlett paused before answering. She knew the very<br> next question would be: ‘And how are all your folks? And how is<br> your dear mother?’ She knew she could not tell them Ellen was<br> dead. She knew that if she spoke those words or even let herself<br> think of them in the presence of these sympathetic women, she would<br> burst into a storm of tears and cry until she was sick. And she<br> could not let herself cry. She had not really cried since she came<br> home and she knew that if she once let down the floodgates, her<br> closely husbanded courage would all be gone. But she knew, too,<br> looking with confusion at the friendly faces about her, that if she<br> withheld the news of Ellen's death, the Fontaines would never<br> forgive her. Grandma in particular was devoted to Ellen and there<br> were very few people in the County for whom the old lady gave a<br> snap of her skinny fingers.<br><br> ‘Well, speak up,’ said Grandma, looking sharply at her. ‘Don't you<br> know, Miss?’<br><br> ‘Well, you see, I didn't get home till the day after the battle,’<br> she answered hastily. ‘The Yankees were all gone then. Pa--Pa<br> told me that--that he got them not to burn the house because<br> Suellen and Carreen were so ill with typhoid they couldn't be<br> moved.’<br><br> ‘That's the first time I ever heard of a Yankee doing a decent<br> thing,’ said Grandma, as if she regretted hearing anything good<br> about the invaders. ‘And how are the girls now?’<br><br> ‘Oh, they are better, much better, almost well but quite weak,’<br> answered Scarlett. Then, seeing the question she feared hovering<br> on the old lady's lips, she cast hastily about for some other topic<br> of conversation.<br><br> ‘I--I wonder if you could lend us something to eat? The Yankees<br> cleaned us out like a swarm of locusts. But, if you are on short<br> rations, just tell me so plainly and--’<br><br> ‘Send over Pork with a wagon and you shall have half of what we've<br> got, rice, meal, ham, some chickens,’ said Old Miss, giving<br> Scarlett a sudden keen look.<br><br> ‘Oh, that's too much! Really, I--’<br><br> ‘Not a word! I won't hear it. What are neighbors for?’<br><br> ‘You are so kind that I can't-- But I have to be going now. The<br> folks at home will be worrying about me.’<br><br> Grandma rose abruptly and took Scarlett by the arm.<br><br> ‘You two stay here,’ she commanded, pushing Scarlett toward the<br> back porch. ‘I have a private word for this child. Help me down<br> the steps, Scarlett.’<br><br> Young Miss and Sally said good-by and promised to come calling<br> soon. They were devoured by curiosity as to what Grandma had to<br> say to Scarlett but unless she chose to tell them, they would never<br> know. Old ladies were so difficult, Young Miss whispered to Sally<br> as they went back to their sewing.<br><br> Scarlett stood with her hand on the horse's bridle, a dull feeling<br> at her heart.<br><br> ‘Now,’ said Grandma, peering into her face, ‘what's wrong at Tara?<br> What are you keeping back?’<br><br> Scarlett looked up into the keen old eyes and knew she could tell<br> the truth, without tears. No one could cry in the presence of<br> Grandma Fontaine without her express permission.<br><br> ‘Mother is dead,’ she said flatly.<br><br> The hand on her arm tightened until it pinched and the wrinkled<br> lids over the yellow eyes blinked.<br><br> ‘Did the Yankees kill her?’<br><br> ‘She died of typhoid. Died--the day before I came home.’<br><br> ‘Don't think about it,’ said Grandma sternly and Scarlett saw her<br> swallow. ‘And your Pa?’<br><br> ‘Pa is--Pa is not himself.’<br><br> ‘What do you mean? Speak up. Is he ill?’<br><br> ‘The shock--he is so strange--he is not--’<br><br> ‘Don't tell me he's not himself. Do you mean his mind is<br> unhinged?’<br><br> It was a relief to hear the truth put so baldly. How good the old<br> lady was to offer no sympathy that would make her cry.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ she said dully, ‘he's lost his mind. He acts dazed and<br> sometimes he can't seem to remember that Mother is dead. Oh, Old<br> Miss, it's more than I can stand to see him sit by the hour,<br> waiting for her and so patiently too, and he used to have no more<br> patience than a child. But it's worse when he does remember that<br> she's gone. Every now and then, after he's sat still with his ear<br> cocked listening for her, he jumps up suddenly and stumps out of<br> the house and down to the burying ground. And then he comes<br> dragging back with the tears all over his face and he says over and<br> over till I could scream: 'Katie Scarlett, Mrs. O'Hara is dead.<br> Your mother is dead,' and it's just like I was hearing it again for<br> the first time. And sometimes, late at night, I hear him calling<br> her and I get out of bed and go to him and tell him she's down at<br> the quarters with a sick darky. And he fusses because she's always<br> tiring herself out nursing people. And it's so hard to get him<br> back to bed. He's like a child. Oh, I wish Dr. Fontaine was here!<br> I know he could do something for Pa! And Melanie needs a doctor<br> too. She isn't getting over her baby like she should--’<br><br> ‘Melly--a baby? And she's with you?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘What's Melly doing with you? Why isn't she in Macon with her aunt<br> and her kinfolks? I never thought you liked her any too well,<br> Miss, for all she was Charles' sister. Now, tell me all about it.’<br><br> ‘It's a long story, Old Miss. Don't you want to go back in the<br> house and sit down?’<br><br> ‘I can stand,’ said Grandma shortly. ‘And if you told your story<br> in front of the others, they'd be bawling and making you feel sorry<br> for yourself. Now, let's have it.’<br><br> Scarlett began haltingly with the siege and Melanie's condition,<br> but as her story progressed beneath the sharp old eyes which never<br> faltered in their gaze, she found words, words of power and horror.<br> It all came back to her, the sickeningly hot day of the baby's<br> birth, the agony of fear, the flight and Rhett's desertion. She<br> spoke of the wild darkness of the night, the blazing camp fires<br> which might be friends or foes, the gaunt chimneys which met her<br> gaze in the morning sun, the dead men and horses along the road,<br> the hunger, the desolation, the fear that Tara had been burned.<br><br> ‘I thought if I could just get home to Mother, she could manage<br> everything and I could lay down the weary load. On the way home I<br> thought the worst had already happened to me, but when I knew she<br> was dead I knew what the worst really was.’<br><br> She dropped her eyes to the ground and waited for Grandma to speak.<br> The silence was so prolonged she wondered if Grandma could have<br> failed to comprehend her desperate plight. Finally the old voice<br> spoke and her tones were kind, kinder than Scarlett had ever heard<br> her use in addressing anyone.<br><br> ‘Child, it's a very bad thing for a woman to face the worst that<br> can happen to her, because after she's faced the worst she can't<br> ever really fear anything again. And it's very bad for a woman not<br> to be afraid of something. You think I don't understand what<br> you've told me--what you've been through? Well, I understand very<br> well. When I was about your age I was in the Creek uprising, right<br> after the Fort Mims massacre--yes,’ she said in a far-away voice,<br> ‘just about your age for that was fifty-odd years ago. And I<br> managed to get into the bushes and hide and I lay there and saw our<br> house burn and I saw the Indians scalp my brothers and sisters.<br> And I could only lie there and pray that the light of the flames<br> wouldn't show up my hiding place. And they dragged Mother out and<br> killed her about twenty feet from where I was lying. And scalped<br> her too. And ever so often one Indian would go back to her and<br> sink his tommyhawk into her skull again. I--I was my mother's pet<br> and I lay there and saw it all. And in the morning I set out for<br> the nearest settlement and it was thirty miles away. It took me<br> three days to get there, through the swamps and the Indians, and<br> afterward they thought I'd lose my mind. . . . That's where I met<br> Dr. Fontaine. He looked after me. . . . Ah, well, that's been<br> fifty years ago, as I said, and since that time I've never been<br> afraid of anything or anybody because I'd known the worst that<br> could happen to me. And that lack of fear has gotten me into a lot<br> of trouble and cost me a lot of happiness. God intended women to<br> be timid frightened creatures and there's something unnatural about<br> a woman who isn't afraid. . . . Scarlett, always save something to<br> fear--even as you save something to love. . . .’<br><br> Her voice trailed off and she stood silent with eyes looking back<br> over half a century to the day when she had been afraid. Scarlett<br> moved impatiently. She had thought Grandma was going to understand<br> and perhaps show her some way to solve her problems. But like all<br> old people she'd gotten to talking about things that happened<br> before anyone was born, things no one was interested in. Scarlett<br> wished she had not confided in her.<br><br> ‘Well, go home, child, or they'll be worrying about you,’ she said<br> suddenly. ‘Send Pork with the wagon this afternoon. . . . And<br> don't think you can lay down the load, ever. Because you can't.<br> I know.’<br><br> <br><br> Indian summer lingered into November that year and the warm days<br> were bright days for those at Tara. The worst was over. They had<br> a horse now and they could ride instead of walk. They had fried<br> eggs for breakfast and fried ham for supper to vary the monotony of<br> the yams, peanuts and dried apples, and on one festal occasion they<br> even had roast chicken. The old sow had finally been captured and<br> she and her brood rooted and grunted happily under the house where<br> they were penned. Sometimes they squealed so loudly no one in the<br> house could talk but it was a pleasant sound. It meant fresh pork<br> for the white folks and chitterlings for the negroes when cold<br> weather and hog-killing time should arrive, and it meant food for<br> the winter for all.<br><br> Scarlett's visit to the Fontaines had heartened her more than she<br> realized. Just the knowledge that she had neighbors, that some of<br> the family friends and old homes had survived, drove out the<br> terrible loss and alone feeling which had oppressed her in her<br> first weeks at Tara. And the Fontaines and Tarletons, whose<br> plantations had not been in the path of the army, were most<br> generous in sharing what little they had. It was the tradition of<br> the County that neighbor helped neighbor and they refused to accept<br> a penny from Scarlett, telling her that she would do the same for<br> them and she could pay them back, in kind, next year when Tara was<br> again producing.<br><br> Scarlett now had food for her household, she had a horse, she had<br> the money and jewelry taken from the Yankee straggler, and the<br> greatest need was new clothing. She knew it would be risky<br> business sending Pork south to buy clothes, when the horse might be<br> captured by either Yankees or Confederates. But, at least, she had<br> the money with which to buy the clothes, a horse and wagon for the<br> trip, and perhaps Pork could make the trip without getting caught.<br> Yes, the worst was over.<br><br> Every morning when Scarlett arose she thanked God for the pale-blue<br> sky and the warm sun, for each day of good weather put off the<br> inevitable time when warm clothing would be needed. And each warm<br> day saw more and more cotton piling up in the empty slave quarters,<br> the only storage place left on the plantation. There was more<br> cotton in the fields than she or Pork had estimated, probably four<br> bales, and soon the cabins would be full.<br><br> Scarlett had not intended to do any cotton picking herself, even<br> after Grandma Fontaine's tart remark. It was unthinkable that she,<br> an O'Hara lady, now the mistress of Tara, should work in the<br> fields. It put her on the same level with the snarly haired Mrs.<br> Slattery and Emmie. She had intended that the negroes should do<br> the field work, while she and the convalescent girls attended to<br> the house, but here she was confronted with a caste feeling even<br> stronger than her own. Pork, Mammy and Prissy set up outcries at<br> the idea of working in the fields. They reiterated that they were<br> house niggers, not field hands. Mammy, in particular, declared<br> vehemently that she had never even been a yard nigger. She had<br> been born in the Robillard great house, not in the quarters, and<br> had been raised in Ole Miss' bedroom, sleeping on a pallet at the<br> foot of the bed. Dilcey alone said nothing and she fixed her<br> Prissy with an unwinking eye that made her squirm.<br><br> Scarlett refused to listen to the protests and drove them all into<br> the cotton rows. But Mammy and Pork worked so slowly and with so<br> many lamentations that Scarlett sent Mammy back to the kitchen to<br> cook and Pork to the woods and the river with snares for rabbits<br> and possums and lines for fish. Cotton picking was beneath Pork's<br> dignity but hunting and fishing were not.<br><br> Scarlett next had tried her sisters and Melanie in the fields, but<br> that had worked no better. Melanie had picked neatly, quickly and<br> willingly for an hour in the hot sun and then fainted quietly and<br> had to stay in bed for a week. Suellen, sullen and tearful,<br> pretended to faint too, but came back to consciousness spitting<br> like an angry cat when Scarlett poured a gourdful of water in her<br> face. Finally she refused point-blank.<br><br> ‘I won't work in the fields like a darky! You can't make me. What<br> if any of our friends ever heard of it? What if--if Mr. Kennedy<br> ever knew? Oh, if Mother knew about this--’<br><br> ‘You just mention Mother's name once more, Suellen O'Hara, and I'll<br> slap you flat,’ cried Scarlett. ‘Mother worked harder than any<br> darky on this place and you know it, Miss Fine Airs!’<br><br> ‘She did not! At least, not in the fields. And you can't make me.<br> I'll tell Papa on you and he won't make me work!’<br><br> ‘Don't you dare go bothering Pa with any of our troubles!’ cried<br> Scarlett, distracted between indignation at her sister and fear for<br> Gerald.<br><br> ‘I'll help you, Sissy,’ interposed Carreen docilely. ‘I'll work<br> for Sue and me too. She isn't well yet and she shouldn't be out in<br> the sun.’<br><br> Scarlett said gratefully: ‘Thank you, Sugarbaby,’ but looked<br> worriedly at her younger sister. Carreen, who had always been as<br> delicately pink and white as the orchard blossoms that are<br> scattered by the spring wind, was no longer pink but still conveyed<br> in her sweet thoughtful face a blossomlike quality. She had been<br> silent, a little dazed since she came back to consciousness and<br> found Ellen gone, Scarlett a termagant, the world changed and<br> unceasing labor the order of the new day. It was not in Carreen's<br> delicate nature to adjust herself to change. She simply could not<br> comprehend what had happened and she went about Tara like a<br> sleepwalker, doing exactly what she was told. She looked, and was,<br> frail but she was willing, obedient and obliging. When she was not<br> doing Scarlett's bidding, her rosary beads were always in her hands<br> and her lips moving in prayers for her mother and for Brent<br> Tarleton. It did not occur to Scarlett that Carreen had taken<br> Brent's death so seriously and that her grief was unhealed. To<br> Scarlet, Carreen was still ‘baby sister,’ far too young to have had<br> a really serious love affair.<br><br> Scarlett, standing in the sun in the cotton rows, her back breaking<br> from the eternal bending and her hands roughened by the dry bolls,<br> wished she had a sister who combined Suellen's energy and strength<br> with Carreen's sweet disposition. For Carreen picked diligently<br> and earnestly. But, after she had labored for an hour it was<br> obvious that she, and not Suellen, was the one not yet well enough<br> for such work. So Scarlett sent Carreen back to the house too.<br><br> There remained with her now in the long rows only Dilcey and<br> Prissy. Prissy picked lazily, spasmodically, complaining of her<br> feet, her back, her internal miseries, her complete weariness,<br> until her mother took a cotton stalk to her and whipped her until<br> she screamed. After that she worked a little better, taking care<br> to stay far from her mother's reach.<br><br> Dilcey worked tirelessly, silently, like a machine, and Scarlett,<br> with her back aching and her shoulder raw from the tugging weight<br> of the cotton bag she carried, thought that Dilcey was worth her<br> weight in gold.<br><br> ‘Dilcey,’ she said, ‘when good times come back, I'm not going to<br> forget how you've acted. You've been mighty good.’<br><br> The bronze giantess did not grin pleasedly or squirm under praise<br> like the other negroes. She turned an immobile face to Scarlett<br> and said with dignity: ‘Thankee, Ma'm. But Mist' Gerald and Miss<br> Ellen been good to me. Mist' Gerald buy my Prissy so I wouldn'<br> grieve and I doan forgit it. I is part Indian and Indians doan<br> forgit them as is good to them. I sorry 'bout my Prissy. She<br> mighty wuthless. Look lak she all nigger lak her pa. Her pa was<br> mighty flighty.’<br><br> In spite of Scarlett's problem of getting help from the others in<br> the picking and in spite of the weariness of doing the labor<br> herself, her spirits lifted as the cotton slowly made its way from<br> the fields to the cabins. There was something about cotton that<br> was reassuring, steadying. Tara had risen to riches on cotton,<br> even as the whole South had risen, and Scarlett was Southerner<br> enough to believe that both Tara and the South would rise again out<br> of the red fields.<br><br> Of course, this little cotton she had gathered was not much but it<br> was something. It would bring a little in Confederate money and<br> that little would help her to save the hoarded greenbacks and gold<br> in the Yankee's wallet until they had to be spent. Next spring<br> she would try to make the Confederate government send back Big<br> Sam and the other field hands they had commandeered, and if the<br> government wouldn't release them, she'd use the Yankee's money to<br> hire field hands from the neighbors. Next spring, she would plant<br> and plant. . . . She straightened her tired back and, looking over<br> the browning autumn fields, she saw next year's crop standing sturdy<br> and green, acre upon acre.<br><br> Next spring! Perhaps by next spring the war would be over and good<br> times would be back. And whether the Confederacy won or lost,<br> times would be better. Anything was better than the constant<br> danger of raids from both armies. When the war was over, a<br> plantation could earn an honest living. Oh, if the war were only<br> over! Then people could plant crops with some certainty of reaping<br> them!<br><br> There was hope now. The war couldn't last forever. She had her<br> little cotton, she had food, she had a horse, she had her small but<br> treasured hoard of money. Yes, the worst was over!<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXVII<br><br> <br> On a noonday in mid-November, they all sat grouped about the dinner<br> table, eating the last of the dessert concocted by Mammy from corn<br> meal and dried huckleberries, sweetened with sorghum. There was a<br> chill in the air, the first chill of the year, and Pork, standing<br> behind Scarlett's chair, rubbed his hands together in glee and<br> questioned: ‘Ain' it 'bout time fer de hawg killin', Miss<br> Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘You can taste those chitlins already, can't you?’ said Scarlett<br> with a grin. ‘Well, I can taste fresh pork myself and if the<br> weather holds for a few days more, we'll--’<br><br> Melanie interrupted, her spoon at her lips,<br><br> ‘Listen, dear! Somebody's coming!’<br><br> ‘Somebody hollerin',’ said Pork uneasily.<br><br> On the crisp autumn air came clear the sound of horse's hooves,<br> thudding as swiftly as a frightened heart, and a woman's voice,<br> high pitched, screaming: ‘Scarlett! Scarlett!’<br><br> Eye met eye for a dreadful second around the table before chairs<br> were pushed back and everyone leaped up. Despite the fear that<br> made it shrill, they recognized the voice of Sally Fontaine who,<br> only an hour before, had stopped at Tara for a brief chat on her<br> way to Jonesboro. Now, as they all rushed pell-mell to crowd the<br> front door, they saw her coming up the drive like the wind on a<br> lathered horse, her hair streaming behind her, her bonnet dangling<br> by its ribbons. She did not draw rein but as she galloped madly<br> toward them, she waved her arm back in the direction from which she<br> had come.<br><br> ‘The Yankees are coming! I saw them! Down the road! The Yankees--’<br><br> She sawed savagely at the horse's mouth just in time to swerve him<br> from leaping up the front steps. He swung around sharply, covered<br> the side lawn in three leaps and she put him across the four-foot<br> hedge as if she were on the hunting field. They heard the heavy<br> pounding of his hooves as he went through the back yard and down<br> the narrow lane between the cabins of the quarters and knew she was<br> cutting across the fields to Mimosa.<br><br> For a moment they stood paralyzed and then Suellen and Carreen<br> began to sob and clutch each other's fingers. Little Wade stood<br> rooted, trembling, unable to cry. What he had feared since the<br> night he left Atlanta had happened. The Yankees were coming to get<br> him.<br><br> ‘Yankees?’ said Gerald vaguely. ‘But the Yankees have already been<br> here.’<br><br> ‘Mother of God!’ cried Scarlett, her eyes meeting Melanie's<br> frightened eyes. For a swift instant there went through her memory<br> again the horrors of her last night in Atlanta, the ruined homes<br> that dotted the countryside, all the stories of rape and torture<br> and murder. She saw again the Yankee soldier standing in the hall<br> with Ellen's sewing box in his hand. She thought: ‘I shall die.<br> I shall die right here. I thought we were through with all that.<br> I shall die. I can't stand any more.’<br><br> Then her eyes fell on the horse saddled and hitched and waiting for<br> Pork to ride him to the Tarleton place on an errand. Her horse!<br> Her only horse! The Yankees would take him and the cow and the<br> calf. And the sow and her litter-- Oh, how many tiring hours it<br> had taken to catch that sow and her agile young! And they'd take<br> the rooster and the setting hens and the ducks the Fontaines had<br> given her. And the apples and the yams in the pantry bins. And<br> the flour and rice and dried peas. And the money in the Yankee<br> soldier's wallet. They'd take everything and leave them to starve.<br><br> ‘They shan't have them!’ she cried aloud and they all turned<br> startled faces to her, fearful her mind had cracked under the<br> tidings. ‘I won't go hungry! They shan't have them!’<br><br> ‘What is it, Scarlett? What is it?’<br><br> ‘The horse! The cow! The pigs! They shan't have them! I won't<br> let them have them!’<br><br> She turned swiftly to the four negroes who huddled in the doorway,<br> their black faces a peculiarly ashen shade.<br><br> ‘The swamp,’ she said rapidly.<br><br> ‘Whut swamp?’<br><br> ‘The river swamp, you fools! Take the pigs to the swamp. All of<br> you. Quickly. Pork, you and Prissy crawl under the house and get<br> the pigs out. Suellen, you and Carreen fill the baskets with as<br> much food as you can carry and get to the woods. Mammy, put the<br> silver in the well again. And Pork! Pork, listen to me, don't<br> stand there like that! Take Pa with you. Don't ask me where!<br> Anywhere! Go with Pork, Pa. That's a sweet pa.’<br><br> Even in her frenzy she thought what the sight of bluecoats might do<br> to Gerald's wavering mind. She stopped and wrung her hands and the<br> frightened sobbing of little Wade who was clutching Melanie's skirt<br> added to her panic.<br><br> ‘What shall I do, Scarlett?’ Melanie's voice was calm amid the<br> wailing and tears and scurrying feet. Though her face was paper<br> white and her whole body trembled, the very quietness of her voice<br> steadied Scarlett, revealing to her that they all looked to her for<br> commands, for guidance.<br><br> ‘The cow and the calf,’ she said quickly. ‘They're in the old<br> pasture. Take the horse and drive them into the swamp and--’<br><br> Before she could finish her sentence, Melanie shook off Wade's<br> clutches and was down the front steps and running toward the horse,<br> pulling up her wide skirts as she ran. Scarlett caught a flashing<br> glimpse of thin legs, a flurry of skirts and underclothing and<br> Melanie was in the saddle, her feet dangling far above the<br> stirrups. She gathered up the reins and clapped her heels against<br> the animal's sides and then abruptly pulled him in, her face<br> twisting with horror.<br><br> ‘My baby!’ she cried. ‘Oh, my baby! The Yankees will kill him!<br> Give him to me!’<br><br> Her hand was on the pommel and she was preparing to slide off but<br> Scarlett screamed at her.<br><br> ‘Go on! Go on! Get the cow! I'll look after the baby! Go on, I<br> tell you! Do you think I'd let them get Ashley's baby? Go on!’<br><br> Melly looked despairingly backward but hammered her heels into the<br> horse and, with a scattering of gravel, was off down the drive<br> toward the pasture.<br><br> Scarlett thought: ‘I never expected to see Melly Hamilton<br> straddling a horse!’ and then she ran into the house. Wade was at<br> her heels, sobbing, trying to catch her flying skirts. As she went<br> up the steps, three at a bound, she saw Suellen and Carreen with<br> split-oak baskets on their arms, running toward the pantry, and<br> Pork tugging none too gently at Gerald's arm, dragging him toward<br> the back porch. Gerald was mumbling querulously and pulling away<br> like a child.<br><br> From the back yard she heard Mammy's strident voice: ‘You, Priss!<br> You git unner dat house an' han' me dem shoats! You knows mighty<br> well Ah's too big ter crawl thoo dem lattices. Dilcey, comyere an'<br> mek dis wuthless chile--’<br><br> ‘And I thought it was such a good idea to keep the pigs under the<br> house, so nobody could steal them,’ thought Scarlett, running into<br> her room. ‘Why, oh, why didn't I build a pen for them down in the<br> swamp?’<br><br> She tore open her top bureau drawer and scratched about in the<br> clothing until the Yankee's wallet was in her hand. Hastily she<br> picked up the solitaire ring and the diamond earbobs from where she<br> had hidden them in her sewing basket and shoved them into the<br> wallet. But where to hide it? In the mattress? Up the chimney?<br> Throw it in the well? Put it in her bosom? No, never there! The<br> outlines of the wallet might show through her basque and if the<br> Yankees saw it they would strip her naked and search her.<br><br> ‘I shall die if they do!’ she thought wildly.<br><br> Downstairs there was a pandemonium of racing feet and sobbing<br> voices. Even in her frenzy, Scarlett wished she had Melanie with<br> her, Melly with her quiet voice, Melly who was so brave the day she<br> shot the Yankee. Melly was worth three of the others. Melly--what<br> had Melly said? Oh, yes, the baby!<br><br> Clutching the wallet to her, Scarlett ran across the hall to the<br> room where little Beau was sleeping in the low cradle. She<br> snatched him up into her arms and he awoke, waving small fists and<br> slobbering sleepily.<br><br> She heard Suellen crying: ‘Come on, Carreen! Come on! We've got<br> enough. Oh, Sister, hurry!’ There were wild squealings, indignant<br> gruntings in the back yard and, running to the widow, Scarlett saw<br> Mammy waddling hurriedly across the cotton field with a struggling<br> young pig under each arm. Behind her was Pork also carrying two<br> pigs and pushing Gerald before him. Gerald was stumping across the<br> furrows, waving his cane.<br><br> Leaning out of the window Scarlett yelled: ‘Get the sow, Dilcey!<br> Make Prissy drive her out. You can chase her across the fields!’<br><br> Dilcey looked up, her bronzed face harassed. In her apron was a<br> pile of silver tableware. She pointed under the house.<br><br> ‘The sow done bit Prissy and got her penned up unner the house.’<br><br> ‘Good for the sow,’ thought Scarlett. She hurried back into her<br> room and hastily gathered from their hiding place the bracelets,<br> brooch, miniature and cup she had found on the dead Yankee. But<br> where to hide them? It was awkward, carrying little Beau in one<br> arm and the wallet and the trinkets in the other. She started to<br> lay him on the bed.<br><br> He set up a wail at leaving her arms and a welcome thought came to<br> her. What better hiding place could there be than a baby's diaper?<br> She quickly turned him over, pulled up his dress and thrust the<br> wallet down the diaper next to his backside. He yelled louder at<br> this treatment and she hastily tightened the triangular garment<br> about his threshing legs.<br><br> ‘Now,’ she thought, drawing a deep breath, ‘now for the swamp!’<br><br> Tucking him screaming under one arm and clutching the jewelry to<br> her with the other, she raced into the upstairs hall. Suddenly her<br> rapid steps paused, fright weakening her knees. How silent the<br> house was! How dreadfully still! Had they all gone off and left<br> her? Hadn't anyone waited for her? She hadn't meant for them to<br> leave her here alone. These days anything could happen to a lone<br> woman and with the Yankees coming--<br><br> She jumped as a slight noise sounded and, turning quickly, saw<br> crouched by the banisters her forgotten son, his eyes enormous with<br> terror. He tried to speak but his throat only worked silently.<br><br> ‘Get up, Wade Hampton,’ she commanded swiftly. ‘Get up and walk.<br> Mother can't carry you now.’<br><br> He ran to her, like a small frightened animal, and clutching her<br> wide skirt, buried his face in it. She could feel his small hands<br> groping through the folds for her legs. She started down the<br> stairs, each step hampered by Wade's dragging hands and she said<br> fiercely: ‘Turn me loose, Wade! Turn me loose and walk!’ But the<br> child only clung the closer.<br><br> As she reached the landing, the whole lower floor leaped up at her.<br> All the homely, well-loved articles of furniture seemed to whisper:<br> ‘Good-by! Good-by!’ A sob rose in her throat. There was the open<br> door of the office where Ellen had labored so diligently and she<br> could glimpse a corner of the old secretary. There was the dining<br> room, with chairs pushed awry and food still on the plates. There<br> on the floor were the rag rugs Ellen had dyed and woven herself.<br> And there was the old portrait of Grandma Robillard, with bosoms<br> half bared, hair piled high and nostrils cut so deeply as to give<br> her face a perpetual well-bred sneer. Everything which had been<br> part of her earliest memories, everything bound up with the deepest<br> roots in her: ‘Good-by! Good-by, Scarlett O'Hara!’<br><br> The Yankees would burn it all--all!<br><br> This was her last view of home, her last view except what she might<br> see from the cover of the woods or the swamp, the tall chimneys<br> wrapped in smoke, the roof crashing in flame.<br><br> ‘I can't leave you,’ she thought and her teeth chattered with fear.<br> ‘I can't leave you. Pa wouldn't leave you. He told them they'd<br> have to burn you over his head. Then, they'll burn you over my<br> head for I can't leave you either. You're all I've got left.’<br><br> With the decision, some of her fear fell away and there remained<br> only a congealed feeling in her breast, as if all hope and fear had<br> frozen. As she stood there, she heard from the avenue the sound of<br> many horses' feet, the jingle of bridle bits and sabers rattling in<br> scabbards and a harsh voice crying a command: ‘Dismount!’ Swiftly<br> she bent to the child beside her and her voice was urgent but oddly<br> gentle.<br><br> ‘Turn me loose, Wade, honey! You run down the stairs quick and<br> through the back yard toward the swamp. Mammy will be there and<br> Aunt Melly. Run quickly, darling, and don't be afraid.’<br><br> At the change in her tone, the boy looked up and Scarlett was<br> appalled at the look in his eyes, like a baby rabbit in a trap.<br><br> ‘Oh, Mother of God!’ she prayed. ‘Don't let him have a convulsion!<br> Not--not before the Yankees. They mustn't know we are afraid.’<br> And, as the child only gripped her skirt the tighter, she said<br> clearly: ‘Be a little man, Wade. They're only a passel of damn<br> Yankees!’<br><br> And she went down the steps to meet them.<br><br> <br><br> Sherman was marching through Georgia, from Atlanta to the sea.<br> Behind him lay the smoking ruins of Atlanta to which the torch had<br> been set as the blue army tramped out. Before him lay three<br> hundred miles of territory virtually undefended save by a few state<br> militia and the old men and young boys of the Home Guard.<br><br> Here lay the fertile state, dotted with plantations, sheltering the<br> women and children, the very old and the negroes. In a swath<br> eighty miles wide the Yankees were looting and burning. There were<br> hundreds of homes in flames, hundreds of homes resounding with<br> their footsteps. But, to Scarlett, watching the bluecoats pour<br> into the front hall, it was not a countrywide affair. It was<br> entirely personal, a malicious action aimed directly at her and<br> hers.<br><br> She stood at the foot of the stairs, the baby in her arms, Wade<br> pressed tightly against her, his head hidden in her skirts as the<br> Yankees swarmed through the house, pushing roughly past her up the<br> stairs, dragging furniture onto the front porch, running bayonets<br> and knives into upholstery and digging inside for concealed<br> valuables. Upstairs they were ripping open mattresses and feather<br> beds until the air in the hall was thick with feathers that floated<br> softly down on her head. Impotent rage quelled what little fear<br> was left in her heart as she stood helpless while they plundered<br> and stole and ruined.<br><br> The sergeant in charge was a bow-legged, grizzled little man with a<br> large wad of tobacco in his cheek. He reached Scarlett before any<br> of his men and, spitting freely on the floor and her skirts, said<br> briefly:<br><br> ‘Lemme have what you got in yore hand, lady.’<br><br> She had forgotten the trinkets she had intended to hide and, with a<br> sneer which she hoped was as eloquent as that pictured on Grandma<br> Robillard's face, she flung the articles to the floor and almost<br> enjoyed the rapacious scramble that ensued.<br><br> ‘I'll trouble you for thet ring and them earbobs.’<br><br> Scarlett tucked the baby more securely under her arm so that he<br> hung face downward, crimson and screaming, and removed the garnet<br> earrings which had been Gerald's wedding present to Ellen. Then<br> she stripped off the large sapphire solitaire which Charles had<br> given her as an engagement ring.<br><br> ‘Don't throw um. Hand um to me,’ said the sergeant, putting out<br> his hands. ‘Them bastards got enough already. What else have you<br> got?’ His eyes went over her basque sharply.<br><br> For a moment Scarlett went faint, already feeling rough hands<br> thrusting themselves into her bosom, fumbling at her garters.<br><br> ‘That is all, but I suppose it is customary to strip your victims?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I'll take your word,’ said the sergeant good-naturedly,<br> spitting again as he turned away. Scarlett righted the baby and<br> tried to soothe him, holding her hand over the place on the diaper<br> where the wallet was hidden, thanking God that Melanie had a baby<br> and that baby had a diaper.<br><br> Upstairs she could hear heavy boots trampling, the protesting<br> screech of furniture pulled across the floor, the crashing of china<br> and mirrors, the curses when nothing of value appeared. From the<br> yard came loud cries: ‘Head um off! Don't let um get away!’ and<br> the despairing squawks of the hens and quacking and honking of the<br> ducks and geese. A pang went through her as she heard an agonized<br> squealing which was suddenly stilled by a pistol shot and she knew<br> that the sow was dead. Damn Prissy! She had run off and left her.<br> If only the shoats were safe! If only the family had gotten safely<br> to the swamp! But there was no way of knowing.<br><br> She stood quietly in the hall while the soldiers boiled about her,<br> shouting and cursing. Wade's fingers were in her skirt in a<br> terrified grip. She could feel his body shaking as he pressed<br> against her but she could not bring herself to speak reassuringly<br> to him. She could not bring herself to utter any word to the<br> Yankees, either of pleading, protest or anger. She could only<br> thank God that her knees still had the strength to support her,<br> that her neck was still strong enough to hold her head high. But<br> when a squad of bearded men came lumbering down the steps, laden<br> with an assortment of stolen articles and she saw Charles' sword in<br> the hands of one, she did cry out.<br><br> That sword was Wade's. It had been his father's and his<br> grandfather's sword and Scarlett had given it to the little boy on<br> his last birthday. They had made quite a ceremony of it and<br> Melanie had cried, cried with tears of pride and sorrowful memory,<br> and kissed him and said he must grow up to be a brave soldier like<br> his father and his grandfather. Wade was very proud of it and<br> often climbed upon the table beneath where it hung to pat it.<br> Scarlett could endure seeing her own possessions going out of the<br> house in hateful alien hands but not this--not her little boy's<br> pride. Wade, peering from the protection of her skirts at the<br> sound of her cry, found speech and courage in a mighty sob.<br> Stretching out one hand he cried:<br><br> ‘Mine!’<br><br> ‘You can't take that!’ said Scarlett swiftly, holding out her hand<br> too.<br><br> ‘I can't, hey?’ said the little soldier who held it, grinning<br> impudently at her. ‘Well, I can! It's a Rebel sword!’<br><br> ‘It's--it's not. It's a Mexican War sword. You can't take it.<br> It's my little boy's. It was his grandfather's! Oh, Captain,’ she<br> cried, turning to the sergeant, ‘please make him give it to me!’<br><br> The sergeant, pleased at his promotion, stepped forward.<br><br> ‘Lemme see thet sword, Bub,’ he said.<br><br> Reluctantly, the little trooper handed it to him. ‘It's got a<br> solid-gold hilt,’ he said.<br><br> The sergeant turned it in his hand, held the hilt up to the<br> sunlight to read the engraved inscription.<br><br> ‘'To Colonel William R. Hamilton,'‘ he deciphered. ‘'From His<br> Staff. For Gallantry. Buena Vista. 1847.'‘<br><br> ‘Ho, lady,’ he said, ‘I was at Buena Vista myself.’<br><br> ‘Indeed,’ said Scarlett icily.<br><br> ‘Was I? Thet was hot fightin', lemme tell you. I ain't seen such<br> hot fightin' in this war as we seen in thet one. So this sword was<br> this little tyke's grandaddy's?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Well, he can have it,’ said the sergeant, who was satisfied enough<br> with the jewelry and trinkets tied up in his handkerchief.<br><br> ‘But it's got a solid-gold hilt,’ insisted the little trooper.<br><br> ‘We'll leave her thet to remember us by,’ grinned the sergeant.<br><br> Scarlett took the sword, not even saying ‘Thank you.’ Why should<br> she thank these thieves for returning her own property to her? She<br> held the sword against her while the little cavalryman argued and<br> wrangled with the sergeant.<br><br> ‘By God, I'll give these damn Rebels something to remember me by,’<br> shouted the private finally when the sergeant, losing his good<br> nature, told him to go to hell and not talk back. The little man<br> went charging toward the back of the house and Scarlett breathed<br> more easily. They had said nothing about burning the house. They<br> hadn't told her to leave so they could fire it. Perhaps--perhaps--<br> The men came rambling into the hall from the upstairs and the out<br> of doors.<br><br> ‘Anything?’ questioned the sergeant.<br><br> ‘One hog and a few chickens and ducks.’<br><br> ‘Some corn and a few yams and beans. That wildcat we saw on the<br> horse must have given the alarm, all right.’<br><br> ‘Regular Paul Revere, eh?’<br><br> ‘Well, there ain't much here, Sarge. You got the pickin's. Let's<br> move on before the whole country gets the news we're comin'.’<br><br> ‘Didja dig under the smokehouse? They generally buries things<br> there.’<br><br> ‘Ain't no smokehouse.’<br><br> ‘Didja dig in the nigger cabins?’<br><br> ‘Nothin' but cotton in the cabins. We set fire to it.’<br><br> For a brief instant Scarlett saw the long hot days in the cotton<br> field, felt again the terrible ache in her back, the raw bruised<br> flesh of her shoulders. All for nothing. The cotton was gone.<br><br> ‘You ain't got much, for a fac', have you, lady?’<br><br> ‘Your army has been here before,’ she said coolly.<br><br> ‘That's a fac'. We were in this neighborhood in September,’ said<br> one of the men, turning something in his hand. ‘I'd forgot.’<br><br> Scarlett saw it was Ellen's gold thimble that he held. How often<br> she had seen it gleaming in and out of Ellen's fancy work. The<br> sight of it brought back too many hurting memories of the slender<br> hand which had worn it. There it lay in this stranger's calloused<br> dirty palm and soon it would find its way North and onto the finger<br> of some Yankee woman who would be proud to wear stolen things.<br> Ellen's thimble!<br><br> Scarlett dropped her head so the enemy could not see her cry and<br> the tears fell slowly down on the baby's head. Through the blur,<br> she saw the men moving toward the doorway, heard the sergeant<br> calling commands in a loud rough voice. They were going and Tara<br> was safe, but with the pain of Ellen's memory on her, she was<br> hardly glad. The sound of the banging sabers and horses' hooves<br> brought little relief and she stood, suddenly weak and nerveless,<br> as they moved off down the avenue, every man laden with stolen<br> goods, clothing, blankets, pictures, hens and ducks, the sow.<br><br> Then to her nostrils was borne the smell of smoke and she turned,<br> too weak with lessening strain, to care about the cotton. Through<br> the open windows of the dining room, she saw smoke drifting lazily<br> out of the negro cabins. There went the cotton. There went the<br> tax money and part of the money which was to see them through this<br> bitter winter. There was nothing she could do about it either,<br> except watch. She had seen fires in cotton before and she knew how<br> difficult they were to put out, even with many men laboring at it.<br> Thank God, the quarters were so far from the house! Thank God,<br> there was no wind today to carry sparks to the roof of Tara!<br><br> Suddenly she swung about, rigid as a pointer, and stared with<br> horror-struck eyes down the hall, down the covered passageway<br> toward the kitchen. There was smoke coming from the kitchen!<br><br> Somewhere between the hall and the kitchen, she laid the baby down.<br> Somewhere she flung off Wade's grip, slinging him against the wall.<br> She burst into the smoke-filled kitchen and reeled back, coughing,<br> her eyes streaming tears from the smoke. Again she plunged in, her<br> skirt held over her nose.<br><br> The room was dark, lit as it was by one small window, and so thick<br> with smoke that she was blinded, but she could hear the hiss and<br> crackle of flames. Dashing a hand across her eyes, she peered<br> squinting and saw thin lines of flame creeping across the kitchen<br> floor, toward the walls. Someone had scattered the blazing logs in<br> the open fireplace across the whole room and the tinder-dry pine<br> floor was sucking in the flames and spewing them up like water.<br><br> Back she rushed to the dining room and snatched a rag rug from the<br> floor, spilling two chairs with a crash.<br><br> ‘I'll never beat it out--never, never! Oh, God, if only there was<br> someone to help! Tara is gone--gone! Oh, God! This was what that<br> little wretch meant when he said he'd give me something to remember<br> him by! Oh, if I'd only let him have the sword!’<br><br> In the hallway she passed her son lying in the corner with his<br> sword. His eyes were closed and his face had a look of slack,<br> unearthly peace.<br><br> ‘My God! He's dead! They've frightened him to death!’ she thought<br> in agony but she raced by him to the bucket of drinking water which<br> always stood in the passageway by the kitchen door.<br><br> She soused the end of the rug into the bucket and drawing a deep<br> breath plunged again into the smoke-filled room slamming the door<br> behind her. For an eternity she reeled and coughed, beating the<br> rug against the lines of fire that shot swiftly beyond her. Twice<br> her long skirt took fire and she slapped it out with her hands.<br> She could smell the sickening smell of her hair scorching, as it<br> came loose from its pins and swept about her shoulders. The flames<br> raced ever beyond her, toward the walls of the covered runway,<br> fiery snakes that writhed and leaped and, exhaustion sweeping her,<br> she knew that it was hopeless.<br><br> Then the door swung open and the sucking draft flung the flames<br> higher. It closed with a bang and, in the swirling smoke,<br> Scarlett, half blind, saw Melanie, stamping her feet on the flames,<br> beating at them with something dark and heavy. She saw her<br> staggering, heard her coughing, caught a lightning-flash glimpse of<br> her set white face and eyes narrow to slits against the smoke, saw<br> her small body curving back and forth as she swung her rug up and<br> down. For another eternity they fought and swayed, side by side,<br> and Scarlett could see that the lines of fire were shortening.<br> Then suddenly Melanie turned toward her and, with a cry, hit her<br> across the shoulders with all her might. Scarlett went down in a<br> whirlwind of smoke and darkness.<br><br> When she opened her eyes she was lying on the back porch, her head<br> pillowed comfortably on Melanie's lap, and the afternoon sunlight<br> was shining on her face. Her hands, face and shoulders smarted<br> intolerably from burns. Smoke was still rolling from the quarters,<br> enveloping the cabins in thick clouds, and the smell of burning<br> cotton was strong. Scarlett saw wisps of smoke drifting from the<br> kitchen and she stirred frantically to rise.<br><br> But she was pushed back as Melanie's calm voice said: ‘Lie still,<br> dear. The fire's out.’<br><br> She lay quiet for a moment, eyes closed, sighing with relief, and<br> heard the slobbery gurgle of the baby near by and the reassuring<br> sound of Wade's hiccoughing. So he wasn't dead, thank God! She<br> opened her eyes and looked up into Melanie's face. Her curls were<br> singed, her face black with smut but her eyes were sparkling with<br> excitement and she was smiling.<br><br> ‘You look like a nigger,’ murmured Scarlett, burrowing her head<br> wearily into its soft pillow.<br><br> ‘And you look like the end man in a minstrel show,’ replied Melanie<br> equably.<br><br> ‘Why did you have to hit me?’<br><br> ‘Because, my darling, your back was on fire. I didn't dream you'd<br> faint, though the Lord knows you've had enough today to kill<br> you. . . . I came back as soon as I got the stock safe in the<br> woods. I nearly died, thinking about you and the baby alone.<br> Did--the Yankees harm you?’<br><br> ‘If you mean did they rape me, no,’ said Scarlett, groaning as she<br> tried to sit up. Though Melanie's lap was soft, the porch on which<br> she was lying was far from comfortable. ‘But they've stolen<br> everything, everything. We've lost everything-- Well, what is<br> there to look so happy about?’<br><br> ‘We haven't lost each other and our babies are all right and we<br> have a roof over our heads,’ said Melanie and there was a lilt in<br> her voice. ‘And that's all anyone can hope for now. . . .<br> Goodness but Beau is wet! I suppose the Yankees even stole his<br> extra diapers. He-- Scarlett, what on earth is in his diaper?’<br><br> She thrust a suddenly frightened hand down the baby's back and<br> brought up the wallet. For a moment she looked at it as if she had<br> never seen it before and then she began to laugh, peal on peal of<br> mirth that had in it no hint of hysteria.<br><br> ‘Nobody but you would ever have thought of it,’ she cried and<br> flinging her arms around Scarlett's neck she kissed her. ‘You are<br> the beatenest sister I ever had!’<br><br> Scarlett permitted the embrace because she was too tired to<br> struggle, because the words of praise brought balm to her spirit<br> and because, in the dark smoke-filled kitchen, there had been born<br> a greater respect for her sister-in-law, a closer feeling of<br> comradeship.<br><br> ‘I'll say this for her,’ she thought grudgingly, ‘she's always<br> there when you need her.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXVIII<br><br> <br> Cold weather set in abruptly with a killing frost. Chilling winds<br> swept beneath the doorsills and rattled the loose windowpanes with<br> a monotonous tinkling sound. The last of the leaves fell from the<br> bare trees and only the pines stood clothed, black and cold against<br> pale skies. The rutted red roads were frozen to flintiness and<br> hunger rode the winds through Georgia.<br><br> Scarlett recalled bitterly her conversation with Grandma Fontaine.<br> On that afternoon two months ago, which now seemed years in the<br> past, she had told the old lady she had already known the worst<br> which could possibly happen to her, and she had spoken from the<br> bottom of her heart. Now that remark sounded like schoolgirl<br> hyperbole. Before Sherman's men came through Tara the second time,<br> she had her small riches of food and money, she had neighbors more<br> fortunate than she and she had the cotton which would tide her over<br> until spring. Now the cotton was gone, the food was gone, the<br> money was of no use to her, for there was no food to buy with it,<br> and the neighbors were in worse plight than she. At least, she had<br> the cow and the calf, a few shoats and the horse, and the neighbors<br> had nothing but the little they had been able to hide in the woods<br> and bury in the ground.<br><br> Fairhill, the Tarleton home, was burned to the foundations, and<br> Mrs. Tarleton and the four girls were existing in the overseer's<br> house. The Munroe house near Lovejoy was leveled too. The wooden<br> wing of Mimosa had burned and only the thick resistant stucco of<br> the main house and the frenzied work of the Fontaine women and<br> their slaves with wet blankets and quilts had saved it. The<br> Calverts' house had again been spared, due to the intercession of<br> Hilton, the Yankee overseer, but there was not a head of livestock,<br> not a fowl, not an ear of corn left on the place.<br><br> At Tara and throughout the County, the problem was food. Most of<br> the families had nothing at all but the remains of their yam crops<br> and their peanuts and such game as they could catch in the woods.<br> What they had, each shared with less fortunate friends, as they had<br> done in more prosperous days. But the time soon came when there<br> was nothing to share.<br><br> At Tara, they ate rabbit and possum and catfish, if Pork was lucky.<br> On other days a small amount of milk, hickory nuts, roasted acorns<br> and yams. They were always hungry. To Scarlett it seemed that at<br> every turn she met outstretched hands, pleading eyes. The sight of<br> them drove her almost to madness, for she was as hungry as they.<br><br> She ordered the calf killed, because he drank so much of the<br> precious milk, and that night everyone ate so much fresh veal all<br> of them were ill. She knew that she should kill one of the shoats<br> but she put it off from day to day, hoping to raise them to<br> maturity. They were so small. There would be so little of them to<br> eat if they were killed now and so much more if they could be saved<br> a little longer. Nightly she debated with Melanie the advisability<br> of sending Pork abroad on the horse with some greenbacks to try to<br> buy food. But the fear that the horse might be captured and the<br> money taken from Pork deterred them. They did not know where the<br> Yankees were. They might be a thousand miles away or only across<br> the river. Once, Scarlett, in desperation, started to ride out<br> herself to search for food, but the hysterical outbursts of the<br> whole family fearful of the Yankees made her abandon the plan.<br><br> Pork foraged far, at times not coming home all night, and Scarlett<br> did not ask him where he went. Sometimes he returned with game,<br> sometimes with a few ears of corn, a bag of dried peas. Once he<br> brought home a rooster which he said he found in the woods. The<br> family ate it with relish but a sense of guilt, knowing very well<br> Pork had stolen it, as he had stolen the peas and corn. One night<br> soon after this, he tapped on Scarlett's door long after the house<br> was asleep and sheepishly exhibited a leg peppered with small shot.<br> As she bandaged it for him, he explained awkwardly that when<br> attempting to get into a hen coop at Fayetteville, he had been<br> discovered. Scarlett did not ask whose hen coop but patted Pork's<br> shoulder gently, tears in her eyes. Negroes were provoking<br> sometimes and stupid and lazy, but there was loyalty in them that<br> money couldn't buy, a feeling of oneness with their white folks<br> which made them risk their lives to keep food on the table.<br><br> In other days Pork's pilferings would have been a serious matter,<br> probably calling for a whipping. In other days she would have been<br> forced at least to reprimand him severely. ‘Always remember,<br> dear,’ Ellen had said, ‘you are responsible for the moral as well<br> as the physical welfare of the darkies God has intrusted to your<br> care. You must realize that they are like children and must be<br> guarded from themselves like children, and you must always set them<br> a good example.’<br><br> But now, Scarlett pushed that admonition into the back of her mind.<br> That she was encouraging theft, and perhaps theft from people worse<br> off than she, was no longer a matter for conscience. In fact the<br> morals of the affair weighed lightly upon her. Instead of<br> punishment or reproof, she only regretted he had been shot.<br><br> ‘You must be more careful, Pork. We don't want to lose you. What<br> would we do without you? You've been mighty good and faithful and<br> when we get some money again, I'm going to buy you a big gold watch<br> and engrave on it something out of the Bible. 'Well done, good and<br> faithful servant.'‘<br><br> Pork beamed under the praise and gingerly rubbed his bandaged leg.<br><br> ‘Dat soun' mighty fine, Miss Scarlett. W'en you speckin' ter git<br> dat money?’<br><br> ‘I don't know, Pork, but I'm going to get it some time, somehow.’<br> She bent on him an unseeing glance that was so passionately bitter<br> he stirred uneasily, ‘Some day, when this war is over, I'm going to<br> have lots of money, and when I do I'll never be hungry or cold<br> again. None of us will ever be hungry or cold. We'll all wear<br> fine clothes and have fried chicken every day and--’<br><br> Then she stopped. The strictest rule at Tara, one which she<br> herself had made and which she rigidly enforced, was that no one<br> should ever talk of the fine meals they had eaten in the past or<br> what they would eat now, if they had the opportunity.<br><br> Pork slipped from the room as she remained staring moodily into the<br> distance. In the old days, now dead and gone, life had been so<br> complex, so full of intricate and complicated problems. There had<br> been the problem of trying to win Ashley's love and trying to keep<br> a dozen other beaux dangling and unhappy. There had been small<br> breaches of conduct to be concealed from her elders, jealous girls<br> to be flouted or placated, styles of dresses and materials to be<br> chosen, different coiffures to be tried and, oh, so many, many<br> other matters to be decided! Now life was so amazingly simple.<br> Now all that mattered was food enough to keep off starvation,<br> clothing enough to prevent freezing and a roof overhead which did<br> not leak too much.<br><br> It was during these days that Scarlett dreamed and dreamed again<br> the nightmare which was to haunt her for years. It was always the<br> same dream, the details never varied, but the terror of it mounted<br> each time it came to her and the fear of experiencing it again<br> troubled even her waking hours. She remembered so well the<br> incidents of the day when she had first dreamed it.<br><br> Cold rain had fallen for days and the house was chill with drafts<br> and dampness. The logs in the fireplace were wet and smoky and<br> gave little heat. There had been nothing to eat except milk since<br> breakfast, for the yams were exhausted and Pork's snares and<br> fishlines had yielded nothing. One of the shoats would have to be<br> killed the next day if they were to eat at all. Strained and<br> hungry faces, black and white, were staring at her, mutely asking<br> her to provide food. She would have to risk losing the horse and<br> send Pork out to buy something. And to make matters worse, Wade<br> was ill with a sore throat and a raging fever and there was neither<br> doctor nor medicine for him.<br><br> Hungry, weary with watching her child, Scarlett left him to<br> Melanie's care for a while and lay down on her bed to nap. Her<br> feet icy, she twisted and turned, unable to sleep, weighed down<br> with fear and despair. Again and again, she thought: ‘What shall<br> I do? Where shall I turn? Isn't there anybody in the world who<br> can help me?’ Where had all the security of the world gone? Why<br> wasn't there someone, some strong wise person to take the burdens<br> from her? She wasn't made to carry them. She did not know how to<br> carry them. And then she fell into an uneasy doze.<br><br> She was in a wild strange country so thick with swirling mist she<br> could not see her hand before her face. The earth beneath her feet<br> was uneasy. It was a haunted land, still with a terrible<br> stillness, and she was lost in it, lost and terrified as a child in<br> the night. She was bitterly cold and hungry and so fearful of what<br> lurked in the mists about her that she tried to scream and could<br> not. There were things in the fog reaching out fingers to pluck at<br> her skirt, to drag her down into the uneasy quaking earth on which<br> she stood, silent, relentless, spectral hands. Then, she knew that<br> somewhere in the opaque gloom about her there was shelter, help, a<br> haven of refuge and warmth. But where was it? Could she reach it<br> before the hands clutched her and dragged her down into the<br> quicksands?<br><br> Suddenly she was running, running through the mist like a mad<br> thing, crying and screaming, throwing out her arms to clutch only<br> empty air and wet mist. Where was the haven? It eluded her but it<br> was there, hidden, somewhere. If she could only reach it! If she<br> could only reach it she would be safe! But terror was weakening<br> her legs, hunger making her faint. She gave one despairing cry and<br> awoke to find Melanie's worried face above her and Melanie's hand<br> shaking her to wakefulness.<br><br> The dream returned again and again, whenever she went to sleep with<br> an empty stomach. And that was frequently enough. It so<br> frightened her that she feared to sleep, although she feverishly<br> told herself there was nothing in such a dream to be afraid of.<br> There was nothing in a dream about fog to scare her so. Nothing at<br> all--yet the thought of dropping off into that mist-filled country<br> so terrified her she began sleeping with Melanie, who would wake<br> her up when her moaning and twitching revealed that she was again<br> in the clutch of the dream.<br><br> Under the strain she grew white and thin. The pretty roundness<br> left her face, throwing her cheek bones into prominence,<br> emphasizing her slanting green eyes and giving her the look of a<br> prowling, hungry cat.<br><br> ‘Daytime is enough like a nightmare without my dreaming things,’<br> she thought desperately and began hoarding her daily ration to eat<br> it just before she went to sleep.<br><br> <br><br> At Christmas time Frank Kennedy and a small troop from the<br> commissary department jogged up to Tara on a futile hunt for grain<br> and animals for the army. They were a ragged and ruffianly<br> appearing crew, mounted on lame and heaving horses which obviously<br> were in too bad condition to be used for more active service. Like<br> their animals the men had been invalided out of the front-line<br> forces and, except for Frank, all of them had an arm missing or an<br> eye gone or stiffened joints. Most of them wore blue overcoats of<br> captured Yankees and, for a brief instant of horror, those at Tara<br> thought Sherman's men had returned.<br><br> They stayed the night on the plantation, sleeping on the floor in<br> the parlor, luxuriating as they stretched themselves on the velvet<br> rug, for it had been weeks since they had slept under a roof or on<br> anything softer than pine needles and hard earth. For all their<br> dirty beards and tatters they were a well-bred crowd, full of<br> pleasant small talk, jokes and compliments and very glad to be<br> spending Christmas Eve in a big house, surrounded by pretty women<br> as they had been accustomed to do in days long past. They refused<br> to be serious about the war, told outrageous lies to make the girls<br> laugh and brought to the bare and looted house the first lightness,<br> the first hint of festivity it had known in many a day.<br><br> ‘It's almost like the old days when we had house parties, isn't<br> it?’ whispered Suellen happily to Scarlett. Suellen was raised to<br> the skies by having a beau of her own in the house again and she<br> could hardly take her eyes off Frank Kennedy. Scarlett was<br> surprised to see that Suellen could be almost pretty, despite the<br> thinness which had persisted since her illness. Her cheeks were<br> flushed and there was a soft luminous look in her eyes.<br><br> ‘She really must care about him,’ thought Scarlett in contempt.<br> ‘And I guess she'd be almost human if she ever had a husband of her<br> own, even if her husband was old fuss-budget Frank.’<br><br> Carreen had brightened a little too, and some of the sleep-walking<br> look left her eyes that night. She had found that one of the men<br> had known Brent Tarleton and had been with him the day he was<br> killed, and she promised herself a long private talk with him after<br> supper.<br><br> At supper Melanie surprised them all by forcing herself out of her<br> timidity and being almost vivacious. She laughed and joked and<br> almost but not quite coquetted with a one-eyed soldier who gladly<br> repaid her efforts with extravagant gallantries. Scarlett knew the<br> effort this involved both mentally and physically, for Melanie<br> suffered torments of shyness in the presence of anything male.<br> Moreover she was far from well. She insisted she was strong and<br> did more work even than Dilcey but Scarlett knew she was sick.<br> When she lifted things her face went white and she had a way of<br> sitting down suddenly after exertions, as if her legs would no<br> longer support her. But tonight she, like Suellen and Carreen,<br> was doing everything possible to make the soldiers enjoy their<br> Christmas Eve. Scarlett alone took no pleasure in the guests.<br><br> The troop had added their ration of parched corn and side meat to<br> the supper of dried peas, stewed dried apples and peanuts which<br> Mammy set before them and they declared it was the best meal they<br> had had in months. Scarlett watched them eat and she was uneasy.<br> She not only begrudged them every mouthful they ate but she was on<br> tenterhooks lest they discover somehow that Pork had slaughtered<br> one of the shoats the day before. It now hung in the pantry and<br> she had grimly promised her household that she would scratch out<br> the eyes of anyone who mentioned the shoat to their guests or the<br> presence of the dead pig's sisters and brothers, safe in their pen<br> in the swamp. These hungry men could devour the whole shoat at one<br> meal and, if they knew of the live hogs, they could commandeer them<br> for the army. She was alarmed, too, for the cow and the horse and<br> wished they were hidden in the swamp, instead of tied in the woods<br> at the bottom of the pasture. If the commissary took her stock,<br> Tara could not possibly live through the winter. There would be no<br> way of replacing them. As to what the army would eat, she did not<br> care. Let the army feed the army--if it could. It was hard enough<br> for her to feed her own.<br><br> The men added as dessert some ‘ramrod rolls’ from their knapsacks,<br> and this was the first time Scarlett had ever seen this Confederate<br> article of diet about which there were almost as many jokes as<br> about lice. They were charred spirals of what appeared to be wood.<br> The men dared her to take a bite and, when she did, she discovered<br> that beneath the smoke-blackened surface was unsalted corn bread.<br> The soldiers mixed their ration of corn meal with water, and salt<br> too when they could get it, wrapped the thick paste about their<br> ramrods and roasted the mess over camp fires. It was as hard as<br> rock candy and as tasteless as sawdust and after one bite Scarlett<br> hastily handed it back amid roars of laughter. She met Melanie's<br> eyes and the same thought was plain in both faces. . . . ‘How can<br> they go on fighting if they have only this stuff to eat?’<br><br> The meal was gay enough and even Gerald, presiding absently at the<br> head of the table, managed to evoke from the back of his dim mind<br> some of the manner of a host and an uncertain smile. The men<br> talked, the women smiled and flattered--but Scarlett turning<br> suddenly to Frank Kennedy to ask him news of Miss Pittypat, caught<br> an expression on his face which made her forget what she intended<br> to say.<br><br> His eyes had left Suellen's and were wandering about the room, to<br> Gerald's childlike puzzled eyes, to the floor, bare of rugs, to the<br> mantelpiece denuded of its ornaments, the sagging springs and torn<br> upholstery into which Yankee bayonets had ripped, the cracked<br> mirror above the sideboard, the unfaded squares on the wall where<br> pictures had hung before the looters came, the scant table service,<br> the decently mended but old dresses of the girls, the flour sack<br> which had been made into a kilt for Wade.<br><br> Frank was remembering the Tara he had known before the war and on<br> his face was a hurt look, a look of tired impotent anger. He loved<br> Suellen, liked her sisters, respected Gerald and had a genuine<br> fondness for the plantation. Since Sherman had swept through<br> Georgia, Frank had seen many appalling sights as he rode about the<br> state trying to collect supplies, but nothing had gone to his heart<br> as Tara did now. He wanted to do something for the O'Haras,<br> especially Suellen, and there was nothing he could do. He was<br> unconsciously wagging his whiskered head in pity and clicking his<br> tongue against his teeth when Scarlett caught his eye. He saw the<br> flame of indignant pride in them and he dropped his gaze quickly to<br> his plate in embarrassment.<br><br> The girls were hungry for news. There had been no mail service<br> since Atlanta fell, now four months past, and they were in complete<br> ignorance as to where the Yankees were, how the Confederate Army<br> was faring, what had happened to Atlanta and to old friends.<br> Frank, whose work took him all over the section, was as good as a<br> newspaper, better even, for he was kin to or knew almost everyone<br> from Macon north to Atlanta, and he could supply bits of<br> interesting personal gossip which the papers always omitted. To<br> cover his embarrassment at being caught by Scarlett, he plunged<br> hastily into a recital of news. The Confederates, he told them,<br> had retaken Atlanta after Sherman marched out, but it was a<br> valueless prize as Sherman had burned it completely.<br><br> ‘But I thought Atlanta burned the night I left,’ cried Scarlett,<br> bewildered. ‘I thought our boys burned it!’<br><br> ‘Oh, no, Miss Scarlett!’ cried Frank, shocked. ‘We'd never burn<br> one of our own towns with our own folks in it! What you saw<br> burning was the warehouses and the supplies we didn't want the<br> Yankees to capture and the foundries and the ammunition. But that<br> was all. When Sherman took the town the houses and stores were<br> standing there as pretty as you please. And he quartered his men<br> in them.’<br><br> ‘But what happened to the people? Did he--did he kill them?’<br><br> ‘He killed some--but not with bullets,’ said the one-eyed soldier<br> grimly. ‘Soon's he marched into Atlanta he told the mayor that all<br> the people in town would have to move out, every living soul. And<br> there were plenty of old folks that couldn't stand the trip and<br> sick folks that ought not to have been moved and ladies who were--<br> well, ladies who hadn't ought to be moved either. And he moved<br> them out in the biggest rainstorm you ever saw, hundreds and<br> hundreds of them, and dumped them in the woods near Rough and Ready<br> and sent word to General Hood to come and get them. And a plenty<br> of the folks died of pneumonia and not being able to stand that<br> sort of treatment.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but why did he do that? They couldn't have done him any<br> harm,’ cried Melanie.<br><br> ‘He said he wanted the town to rest his men and horses in,’ said<br> Frank. ‘And he rested them there till the middle of November and<br> then he lit out. And he set fire to the whole town when he left<br> and burned everything.’<br><br> ‘Oh, surely not everything!’ cried the girls in dismay.<br><br> It was inconceivable that the bustling town they knew, so full of<br> people, so crowded with soldiers, was gone. All the lovely homes<br> beneath shady trees, all the big stores and the fine hotels--surely<br> they couldn't be gone! Melanie seemed ready to burst into tears,<br> for she had been born there and knew no other home. Scarlett's<br> heart sank because she had come to love the place second only to<br> Tara.<br><br> ‘Well, almost everything,’ Frank amended hastily, disturbed by the<br> expressions on their faces. He tried to look cheerful, for he did<br> not believe in upsetting ladies. Upset ladies always upset him and<br> made him feel helpless. He could not bring himself to tell them<br> the worst. Let them find out from some one else.<br><br> He could not tell them what the army saw when it marched back into<br> Atlanta, the acres and acres of chimneys standing blackly above<br> ashes, piles of half-burned rubbish and tumbled heaps of brick<br> clogging the streets, old trees dying from fire, their charred<br> limbs tumbling to the ground in the cold wind. He remembered how<br> the sight had turned him sick, remembered the bitter curses of the<br> Confederates when they saw the remains of the town. He hoped the<br> ladies would never hear of the horrors of the looted cemetery, for<br> they'd never get over that. Charlie Hamilton and Melanie's mother<br> and father were buried there. The sight of that cemetery still<br> gave Frank nightmares. Hoping to find jewelry buried with the<br> dead, the Yankee soldiers had broken open vaults, dug up graves.<br> They had robbed the bodies, stripped from the coffins gold and<br> silver name plates, silver trimmings and silver handles. The<br> skeletons and corpses, flung helterskelter among their splintered<br> caskets, lay exposed and so pitiful.<br><br> And Frank couldn't tell them about the dogs and the cats. Ladies<br> set such a store by pets. But the thousands of starving animals,<br> left homeless when their masters had been so rudely evacuated, had<br> shocked him almost as much as the cemetery, for Frank loved cats<br> and dogs. The animals had been frightened, cold, ravenous, wild as<br> forest creatures, the strong attacking the weak, the weak waiting<br> for the weaker to die so they could eat them. And, above the<br> ruined town, the buzzards splotched the wintry sky with graceful,<br> sinister bodies.<br><br> Frank cast about in his mind for some mitigating information that<br> would make the ladies feel better.<br><br> ‘There's some houses still standing,’ he said, ‘houses that set on<br> big lots away from other houses and didn't catch fire. And the<br> churches and the Masonic hall are left. And a few stores too. But<br> the business section and all along the railroad tracks and at Five<br> Points--well, ladies, that part of town is flat on the ground.’<br><br> ‘Then,’ cried Scarlett bitterly, ‘that warehouse Charlie left me,<br> down on the tracks, it's gone too?’<br><br> ‘If it was near the tracks, it's gone, but--’ Suddenly he smiled.<br> Why hadn't he thought of it before? ‘Cheer up, ladies! Your Aunt<br> Pitty's house is still standing. It's kind of damaged but there it<br> is.’<br><br> ‘Oh, how did it escape?’<br><br> ‘Well, it's made of brick and it's got about the only slate roof in<br> Atlanta and that kept the sparks from setting it afire, I guess.<br> And then it's about the last house on the north end of town and the<br> fire wasn't so bad over that way. Of course, the Yankees quartered<br> there tore it up aplenty. They even burned the baseboard and the<br> mahogany stair rail for firewood, but shucks! It's in good shape.<br> When I saw Miss Pitty last week in Macon--’<br><br> ‘You saw her? How is she?’<br><br> ‘Just fine. Just fine. When I told her her house was still<br> standing, she made up her mind to come home right away. That is--<br> if that old darky, Peter, will let her come. Lots of the Atlanta<br> people have already come back, because they got nervous about<br> Macon. Sherman didn't take Macon but everybody is afraid Wilson's<br> raiders will get there soon and he's worse than Sherman.’<br><br> ‘But how silly of them to come back if there aren't any houses!<br> Where do they live?’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, they're living in tents and shacks and log cabins<br> and doubling up six and seven families in the few houses still<br> standing. And they're trying to rebuild. Now, Miss Scarlett,<br> don't say they are silly. You know Atlanta folks as well as I do.<br> They are plumb set on that town, most as bad as Charlestonians are<br> about Charleston, and it'll take more than Yankees and a burning to<br> keep them away. Atlanta folks are--begging your pardon, Miss<br> Melly--as stubborn as mules about Atlanta. I don't know why, for I<br> always thought that town a mighty pushy, impudent sort of place.<br> But then, I'm a countryman born and I don't like any town. And let<br> me tell you, the ones who are getting back first are the smart<br> ones. The ones who come back last won't find a stick or stone or<br> brick of their houses, because everybody's out salvaging things all<br> over town to rebuild their houses. Just day before yesterday, I<br> saw Mrs. Merriwether and Miss Maybelle and their old darky woman<br> out collecting brick in a wheelbarrow. And Mrs. Meade told me she<br> was thinking about building a log cabin when the doctor comes back<br> to help her. She said she lived in a log cabin when she first came<br> to Atlanta, when it was Marthasville, and it wouldn't bother her<br> none to do it again. 'Course, she was only joking but that shows<br> you how they feel about it.’<br><br> ‘I think they've got a lot of spirit,’ said Melanie proudly.<br> ‘Don't you, Scarlett?’<br><br> Scarlett nodded, a grim pleasure and pride in her adopted town<br> filling her. As Frank said, it was a pushy, impudent place and<br> that was why she liked it. It wasn't hide-bound and stick-in-the-<br> muddish like the older towns and it had a brash exuberance that<br> matched her own. ‘I'm like Atlanta,’ she thought. ‘It takes more<br> than Yankees or a burning to keep me down.’<br><br> ‘If Aunt Pitty is going back to Atlanta, we'd better go back and<br> stay with her, Scarlett,’ said Melanie, interrupting her train of<br> thought. ‘She'll die of fright alone.’<br><br> ‘Now, how can I leave here, Melly?’ Scarlett asked crossly. ‘If<br> you are so anxious to go, go. I won't stop you.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I didn't mean it that way, darling,’ cried Melanie, flushing<br> with distress. ‘How thoughtless of me! Of course, you can't leave<br> Tara and--and I guess Uncle Peter and Cookie can take care of<br> Auntie.’<br><br> ‘There's nothing to keep you from going,’ Scarlett pointed out,<br> shortly.<br><br> ‘You know I wouldn't leave you,’ answered Melanie. ‘And I--I would<br> be just frightened to death without you.’<br><br> ‘Suit yourself. Besides, you wouldn't catch me going back to<br> Atlanta. Just as soon as they get a few houses up, Sherman will<br> come back and burn it again.’<br><br> ‘He won't be back,’ said Frank and, despite his efforts, his face<br> drooped. ‘He's gone on through the state to the coast. Savannah<br> was captured this week and they say the Yankees are going on up<br> into South Carolina.’<br><br> ‘Savannah taken!’<br><br> ‘Yes. Why, ladies, Savannah couldn't help but fall. They didn't<br> have enough men to hold it, though they used every man they could<br> get--every man who could drag one foot after another. Do you know<br> that when the Yankees were marching on Milledgeville, they called<br> out all the cadets from the military academies, no matter how young<br> they were, and even opened the state penitentiary to get fresh<br> troops? Yes, sir, they turned loose every convict who was willing<br> to fight and promised him a pardon if he lived through the war. It<br> kind of gave me the creeps to see those little cadets in the ranks<br> with thieves and cutthroats.’<br><br> ‘They turned loose the convicts on us!’<br><br> ‘Now, Miss Scarlett, don't you get upset. They're a long way off<br> from here, and furthermore they're making good soldiers. I guess<br> being a thief don't keep a man from being a good soldier, does it?’<br><br> ‘I think it's wonderful,’ said Melanie softly.<br><br> ‘Well, I don't,’ said Scarlett flatly. ‘There's thieves enough<br> running around the country anyway, what with the Yankees and--’<br> She caught herself in time but the men laughed.<br><br> ‘What with Yankees and our commissary department,’ they finished<br> and she flushed.<br><br> ‘But where's General Hood's army?’ interposed Melanie hastily.<br> ‘Surely he could have held Savannah.’<br><br> ‘Why, Miss Melanie,’ Frank was startled and reproachful, ‘General<br> Hood hasn't been down in that section at all. He's been fighting<br> up in Tennessee, trying to draw the Yankees out of Georgia.’<br><br> ‘And didn't his little scheme work well!’ cried Scarlett<br> sarcastically. ‘He left the damn Yankees to go through us with<br> nothing but schoolboys and convicts and Home Guards to protect us.’<br><br> ‘Daughter,’ said Gerald rousing himself, ‘you are profane. Your<br> mother will be grieved.’<br><br> ‘They are damn Yankees!’ cried Scarlett passionately. ‘And I never<br> expect to call them anything else.’<br><br> At the mention of Ellen everyone felt queer and conversation<br> suddenly ceased. Melanie again interposed.<br><br> ‘When you were in Macon did you see India and Honey Wilkes? Did<br> they--had they heard anything of Ashley?’<br><br> ‘Now, Miss Melly, you know if I'd had news of Ashley, I'd have<br> ridden up here from Macon right away to tell you,’ said Frank<br> reproachfully. ‘No, they didn't have any news but--now, don't you<br> fret about Ashley, Miss Melly. I know it's been a long time since<br> you heard from him, but you can't expect to hear from a fellow when<br> he's in prison, can you? And things aren't as bad in Yankee<br> prisons as they are in ours. After all, the Yankees have plenty to<br> eat and enough medicines and blankets. They aren't like we are--<br> not having enough to feed ourselves, much less our prisoners.’<br><br> ‘Oh, the Yankees have got plenty,’ cried Melanie, passionately<br> bitter. ‘But they don't give things to the prisoners. You know<br> they don't, Mr. Kennedy. You are just saying that to make me feel<br> better. You know that our boys freeze to death up there and starve<br> too and die without doctors and medicine, simply because the<br> Yankees hate us so much! Oh, if we could just wipe every Yankee<br> off the face of the earth! Oh, I know that Ashley is--’<br><br> ‘Don't say it!’ cried Scarlett, her heart in her throat. As long<br> as no one said Ashley was dead, there persisted in her heart a<br> faint hope that he lived, but she felt that if she heard the words<br> pronounced, in that moment he would die.<br><br> ‘Now, Mrs. Wilkes, don't you bother about your husband,’ said the<br> one-eyed man soothingly. ‘I was captured after first Manassas and<br> exchanged later and when I was in prison, they fed me off the fat<br> of the land, fried chicken and hot biscuits--’<br><br> ‘I think you are a liar,’ said Melanie with a faint smile and the<br> first sign of spirit Scarlett had ever seen her display with a man.<br> ‘What do you think?’<br><br> ‘I think so too,’ said the one-eyed man and slapped his leg with a<br> laugh.<br><br> ‘If you'll all come into the parlor, I'll sing you some Christmas<br> carols,’ said Melanie, glad to change the subject. ‘The piano was<br> one thing the Yankees couldn't carry away. Is it terribly out of<br> tune, Suellen?’<br><br> ‘Dreadfully,’ answered Suellen, happily beckoning with a smile to<br> Frank.<br><br> But as they all passed from the room, Frank hung back, tugging at<br> Scarlett's sleeve.<br><br> ‘May I speak to you alone?’<br><br> For an awful moment she feared he was going to ask about her<br> livestock and she braced herself for a good lie.<br><br> When the room was cleared and they stood by the fire, all the false<br> cheerfulness which had colored Frank's face in front of the others<br> passed and she saw that he looked like an old man. His face was as<br> dried and brown as the leaves that were blowing about the lawn of<br> Tara and his ginger-colored whiskers were thin and scraggly and<br> streaked with gray. He clawed at them absently and cleared his<br> throat in an annoying way before he spoke.<br><br> ‘I'm sorry about your ma, Miss Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘Please don't talk about it.’<br><br> ‘And your pa-- Has he been this way since--?’<br><br> ‘Yes--he's--he's not himself, as you can see.’<br><br> ‘He sure set a store by her.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Mr. Kennedy, please don't let's talk--’<br><br> ‘I'm sorry, Miss Scarlett,’ and he shuffled his feet nervously.<br> ‘The truth is I wanted to take up something with your pa and now I<br> see it won't do any good.’<br><br> ‘Perhaps I can help you, Mr. Kennedy. You see--I'm the head of the<br> house now.’<br><br> ‘Well, I,’ began Frank and again clawed nervously at his beard.<br> ‘The truth is-- Well, Miss Scarlett, I was aiming to ask him for<br> Miss Suellen.’<br><br> ‘Do you mean to tell me,’ cried Scarlett in amused amazement, ‘that<br> you haven't yet asked Pa for Suellen? And you've been courting her<br> for years!’<br><br> He flushed and grinned embarrassedly and in general looked like a<br> shy and sheepish boy.<br><br> ‘Well, I--I didn't know if she'd have me. I'm so much older than<br> she is and--there were so many good-looking young bucks hanging<br> around Tara--’<br><br> ‘Hump!’ thought Scarlett, ‘they were hanging around me, not her!’<br><br> ‘And I don't know yet if she'll have me. I've never asked her but<br> she must know how I feel. I--I thought I'd ask Mr. O'Hara's<br> permission and tell him the truth. Miss Scarlett, I haven't got a<br> cent now. I used to have a lot of money, if you'll forgive me<br> mentioning it, but right now all I own is my horse and the clothes<br> I've got on. You see, when I enlisted I sold most of my land and I<br> put all my money in Confederate bonds and you know what they're<br> worth now. Less than the paper they're printed on. And anyway, I<br> haven't got them now, because they burned up when the Yankees<br> burned my sister's house. I know I've got gall asking for Miss<br> Suellen now when I haven't a cent but--well, it's this way. I got<br> to thinking that we don't know how things are going to turn out<br> about this war. It sure looks like the end of the world for me.<br> There's nothing we can be sure of and--and I thought it would be a<br> heap of comfort to me and maybe to her if we were engaged. That<br> would be something sure. I wouldn't ask to marry her till I could<br> take care of her, Miss Scarlett, and I don't know when that will<br> be. But if true love carries any weight with you, you can be<br> certain Miss Suellen will be rich in that if nothing else.’<br><br> He spoke the last words with a simple dignity that touched<br> Scarlett, even in her amusement. It was beyond her comprehension<br> that anyone could love Suellen. Her sister seemed to her a monster<br> of selfishness, of complaints and of what she could only describe<br> as pure cussedness.<br><br> ‘Why, Mr. Kennedy,’ she said kindly, ‘it's quite all right. I'm<br> sure I can speak for Pa. He always set a store by you and he<br> always expected Suellen to marry you.’<br><br> ‘Did he now?’ cried Frank, happiness in his face.<br><br> ‘Indeed yes,’ answered Scarlett, concealing a grin as she<br> remembered how frequently Gerald had rudely bellowed across the<br> supper table to Suellen: ‘How now, Missy! Hasn't your ardent beau<br> popped the question yet? Shall I be asking him his intentions?’<br><br> ‘I shall ask her tonight,’ he said, his face quivering, and he<br> clutched her hand and shook it. ‘You're so kind, Miss Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘I'll send her to you,’ smiled Scarlett, starting for the parlor.<br> Melanie was beginning to play. The piano was sadly out of tune but<br> some of the chords were musical and Melanie was raising her voice<br> to lead the others in ‘Hark, the Herald Angels Sing!’<br><br> Scarlett paused. It did not seem possible that war had swept over<br> them twice, that they were living in a ravaged country, close to<br> the border of starvation, when this old sweet Christmas hymn was<br> being sung. Abruptly she turned to Frank.<br><br> ‘What did you mean when you said it looked like the end of the<br> world to you?’<br><br> ‘I'll talk frankly,’ he said slowly, ‘but I wouldn't want you to be<br> alarming the other ladies with what I say. The war can't go on<br> much longer. There aren't any fresh men to fill the ranks and the<br> desertions are running high--higher than the army likes to admit.<br> You see, the men can't stand to be away from their families when<br> they know they're starving, so they go home to try to provide for<br> them. I can't blame them but it weakens the army. And the army<br> can't fight without food and there isn't any food. I know because,<br> you see, getting food is my business. I've been all up and down<br> this section since we retook Atlanta and there isn't enough to feed<br> a jaybird. It's the same way for three hundred miles south to<br> Savannah. The folks are starving and the railroads are torn up and<br> there aren't any new rifles and the ammunition is giving out and<br> there's no leather at all for shoes. . . . So, you see, the end is<br> almost here.’<br><br> But the fading hopes of the Confederacy weighed less heavily on<br> Scarlett than his remark about the scarcity of food. It had been<br> her intention to send Pork out with the horse and wagon, the gold<br> pieces and the United States money to scour the countryside for<br> provisions and material for clothes. But if what Frank said was<br> true--<br><br> But Macon hadn't fallen. There must be food in Macon. Just as<br> soon as the commissary department was safely on its way, she'd<br> start Pork for Macon and take the chance of having the precious<br> horse picked up by the army. She'd have to risk it.<br><br> ‘Well, let's don't talk about unpleasant things tonight, Mr.<br> Kennedy,’ she said. ‘You go and sit in Mother's little office and<br> I'll send Suellen to you so you can--well, so you'll have a little<br> privacy.’<br><br> Blushing, smiling, Frank slipped out of the room and Scarlett<br> watched him go.<br><br> ‘What a pity he can't marry her now,’ she thought. ‘That would be<br> one less mouth to feed.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXIX<br><br> <br> The following April General Johnston, who had been given back the<br> shattered remnants of his old command, surrendered them in North<br> Carolina and the war was over. But not until two weeks later did<br> the news reach Tara. There was too much to do at Tara for anyone<br> to waste time traveling abroad and hearing gossip and, as the<br> neighbors were just as busy as they, there was little visiting and<br> news spread slowly.<br><br> Spring plowing was at its height and the cotton and garden seed<br> Pork had brought from Macon was being put into the ground. Pork<br> had been almost worthless since the trip, so proud was he of<br> returning safely with his wagon-load of dress goods, seed, fowls,<br> hams, side meat and meal. Over and over, he told the story of his<br> many narrow escapes, of the bypaths and country lanes he had taken<br> on his return to Tara, the unfrequented roads, the old trails, the<br> bridle paths. He had been five weeks on the road, agonizing weeks<br> for Scarlett. But she did not upbraid him on his return, for she<br> was happy that he had made the trip successfully and pleased that<br> he brought back so much of the money she had given him. She had a<br> shrewd suspicion that the reason he had so much money left over was<br> that he had not bought the fowls or most of the food. Pork would<br> have taken shame to himself had he spent her money when there were<br> unguarded hen coops along the road and smokehouses handy.<br><br> Now that they had a little food, everyone at Tara was busy trying<br> to restore some semblance of naturalness to life. There was work<br> for every pair of hands, too much work, never-ending work. The<br> withered stalks of last year's cotton had to be removed to make way<br> for this year's seeds and the balky horse, unaccustomed to the<br> plow, dragged unwillingly through the fields. Weeds had to be<br> pulled from the garden and the seeds planted, firewood had to be<br> cut, a beginning had to be made toward replacing the pens and the<br> miles and miles of fences so casually burned by the Yankees. The<br> snares Pork set for rabbits had to be visited twice a day and the<br> fishlines in the river rebaited. There were beds to be made and<br> floors to be swept, food to be cooked and dishes washed, hogs and<br> chickens to be fed and eggs gathered. The cow had to be milked and<br> pastured near the swamp and someone had to watch her all day for<br> fear the Yankees or Frank Kennedy's men would return and take her.<br> Even little Wade had his duties. Every morning he went out<br> importantly with a basket to pick up twigs and chips to start the<br> fires with.<br><br> It was the Fontaine boys, the first of the County men home from the<br> war, who brought the news of the surrender. Alex, who still had<br> boots, was walking and Tony, barefooted, was riding on the bare<br> back of a mule. Tony always managed to get the best of things in<br> that family. They were swarthier than ever from four years'<br> exposure to sun and storm, thinner, more wiry, and the wild black<br> beards they brought back from the war made them seem like<br> strangers.<br><br> On their way to Mimosa and eager for home, they only stopped a<br> moment at Tara to kiss the girls and give them news of the<br> surrender. It was all over, they said, all finished, and they did<br> not seem to care much or want to talk about it. All they wanted to<br> know was whether Mimosa had been burned. On the way south from<br> Atlanta, they had passed chimney after chimney where the homes of<br> friends had stood and it seemed almost too much to hope that their<br> own house had been spared. They sighed with relief at the welcome<br> news and laughed, slapping their thighs when Scarlett told them of<br> Sally's wild ride and how neatly she had cleared their hedge.<br><br> ‘She's a spunky girl,’ said Tony, ‘and it's rotten luck for her,<br> Joe getting killed. You all got any chewing tobacco, Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘Nothing but rabbit tobacco. Pa smokes it in a corn cob.’<br><br> ‘I haven't fallen that low yet,’ said Tony, ‘but I'll probably come<br> to it.’<br><br> ‘Is Dimity Munroe all right?’ asked Alex, eagerly but a little<br> embarrassed, and Scarlett recalled vaguely that he had been sweet<br> on Sally's younger sister.<br><br> ‘Oh, yes. She's living with her aunt over in Fayetteville now.<br> You know their house in Lovejoy was burned. And the rest of her<br> folks are in Macon.’<br><br> ‘What he means is--has Dimity married some brave colonel in the<br> Home Guard?’ jeered Tony, and Alex turned furious eyes upon him.<br><br> ‘Of course, she isn't married,’ said Scarlett, amused.<br><br> ‘Maybe it would be better if she had,’ said Alex gloomily. ‘How<br> the hell--I beg your pardon, Scarlett. But how can a man ask a<br> girl to marry him when his darkies are all freed and his stock gone<br> and he hasn't got a cent in his pockets?’<br><br> ‘You know that wouldn't bother Dimity,’ said Scarlett. She could<br> afford to be loyal to Dimity and say nice things about her, for<br> Alex Fontaine had never been one of her own beaux.<br><br> ‘Hell's afire-- Well, I beg your pardon again. I'll have to quit<br> swearing or Grandma will sure tan my hide. I'm not asking any girl<br> to marry a pauper. It mightn't bother her but it would bother me.’<br><br> While Scarlett talked to the boys on the front porch, Melanie,<br> Suellen and Carreen slipped silently into the house as soon as they<br> heard the news of the surrender. After the boys had gone, cutting<br> across the back fields of Tara toward home, Scarlett went inside<br> and heard the girls sobbing together on the sofa in Ellen's little<br> office. It was all over, the bright beautiful dream they had loved<br> and hoped for, the Cause which had taken their friends, lovers,<br> husbands and beggared their families. The Cause they had thought<br> could never fall had fallen forever.<br><br> But for Scarlett, there were no tears. In the first moment when<br> she heard the news she thought: Thank God! Now the cow won't be<br> stolen. Now the horse is safe. Now we can take the silver out of<br> the well and everybody can have a knife and fork. Now I won't be<br> afraid to drive round the country looking for something to eat.<br><br> What a relief! Never again would she start in fear at the sound of<br> hooves. Never again would she wake in the dark nights, holding her<br> breath to listen, wondering if it were reality or only a dream that<br> she heard in the yard the rattle of bits, the stamping of hooves<br> and the harsh crying of orders by the Yankees. And, best of all,<br> Tara was safe! Now her worst nightmare would never come true. Now<br> she would never have to stand on the lawn and see smoke billowing<br> from the beloved house and hear the roar of flames as the roof fell<br> in.<br><br> Yes, the Cause was dead but war had always seemed foolish to her<br> and peace was better. She had never stood starry eyed when the<br> Stars and Bars ran up a pole or felt cold chills when ‘Dixie’<br> sounded. She had not been sustained through privations, the<br> sickening duties of nursing, the fears of the siege and the hunger<br> of the last few months by the fanatic glow which made all these<br> things endurable to others, if only the Cause prospered. It was<br> all over and done with and she was not going to cry about it.<br><br> All over! The war which had seemed so endless, the war which,<br> unbidden and unwanted, had cut her life in two, had made so clean a<br> cleavage that it was difficult to remember those other care-free<br> days. She could look back, unmoved, at the pretty Scarlett with<br> her fragile green morocco slippers and her flounces fragrant with<br> lavender but she wondered if she could be that same girl. Scarlett<br> O'Hara, with the County at her feet, a hundred slaves to do her<br> bidding, the wealth of Tara like a wall behind her and doting<br> parents anxious to grant any desire of her heart. Spoiled,<br> careless Scarlett who had never known an ungratified wish except<br> where Ashley was concerned.<br><br> Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years,<br> the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers had slipped away and<br> there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies<br> and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing<br> was left from the wreckage except the indestructible red earth on<br> which she stood.<br><br> As she stood in the hall, listening to the girls sobbing, her mind<br> was busy.<br><br> ‘We'll plant more cotton, lots more. I'll send Pork to Macon<br> tomorrow to buy more seed. Now the Yankees won't burn it and our<br> troops won't need it. Good Lord! Cotton ought to go sky high this<br> fall!’<br><br> She went into the little office and, disregarding the weeping girls<br> on the sofa, seated herself at the secretary and picked up a quill<br> to balance the cost of more cotton seed against her remaining cash.<br><br> ‘The war is over,’ she thought and suddenly she dropped the quill<br> as a wild happiness flooded her. The war was over and Ashley--if<br> Ashley was alive he'd be coming home! She wondered if Melanie, in<br> the midst of mourning for the lost Cause, had thought of this.<br><br> ‘Soon we'll get a letter--no, not a letter. We can't get letters.<br> But soon--oh, somehow he'll let us know!’<br><br> But the days passed into weeks and there was no news from Ashley.<br> The mail service in the South was uncertain and in the rural<br> districts there was none at all. Occasionally a passing traveler<br> from Atlanta brought a note from Aunt Pitty tearfully begging the<br> girls to come back. But never news of Ashley.<br><br> <br><br> After the surrender, an ever-present feud over the horse smoldered<br> between Scarlett and Suellen. Now that there was no danger of<br> Yankees, Suellen wanted to go calling on the neighbors. Lonely and<br> missing the happy sociability of the old days, Suellen longed to<br> visit friends, if for no other reason than to assure herself that<br> the rest of the County was as bad off as Tara. But Scarlett was<br> adamant. The horse was for work, to drag logs from the woods, to<br> plow and for Pork to ride in search of food. On Sundays he had<br> earned the right to graze in the pasture and rest. If Suellen<br> wanted to go visiting she could go afoot.<br><br> Before the last year Suellen had never walked a hundred yards in<br> her life and this prospect was anything but pleasing. So she<br> stayed at home and nagged and cried and said, once too often: ‘Oh,<br> if only Mother was here!’ At that, Scarlett gave her the long-<br> promised slap, hitting her so hard it knocked her screaming to the<br> bed and caused great consternation throughout the house.<br> Thereafter, Suellen whined the less, at least in Scarlett's<br> presence.<br><br> Scarlett spoke truthfully when she said she wanted the horse to<br> rest but that was only half of the truth. The other half was that<br> she had paid one round of calls on the County in the first month<br> after the surrender and the sight of old friends and old<br> plantations had shaken her courage more than she liked to admit.<br><br> The Fontaines had fared best of any, thanks to Sally's hard ride,<br> but it was flourishing only by comparison with the desperate<br> situation of the other neighbors. Grandma Fontaine had never<br> completely recovered from the heart attack she had the day she led<br> the others in beating out the flames and saving the house. Old Dr.<br> Fontaine was convalescing slowly from an amputated arm. Alex and<br> Tony were turning awkward hands to plows and hoe handles. They<br> leaned over the fence rail to shake hands with Scarlett when she<br> called and they laughed at her rickety wagon, their black eyes<br> bitter, for they were laughing at themselves as well as her. She<br> asked to buy seed corn from them and they promised it and fell to<br> discussing farm problems. They had twelve chickens, two cows, five<br> hogs and the mule they brought home from the war. One of the hogs<br> had just died and they were worried about losing the others. At<br> hearing such serious words about hogs from these ex-dandies who had<br> never given life a more serious thought than which cravat was most<br> fashionable, Scarlett laughed and this time her laugh was bitter<br> too.<br><br> They had all made her welcome at Mimosa and had insisted on giving,<br> not selling, her the seed corn. The quick Fontaine tempers flared<br> when she put a greenback on the table and they flatly refused<br> payment. Scarlett took the corn and privately slipped a dollar<br> bill into Sally's hand. Sally looked like a different person from<br> the girl who had greeted her eight months before when Scarlett<br> first came home to Tara. Then she had been pale and sad but there<br> had been a buoyancy about her. Now that buoyancy had gone, as if<br> the surrender had taken all hope from her.<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ she whispered as she clutched the bill, ‘what was the<br> good of it all? Why did we ever fight? Oh, my poor Joe! Oh, my<br> poor baby!’<br><br> ‘I don't know why we fought and I don't care,’ said Scarlett. ‘And<br> I'm not interested. I never was interested. War is a man's<br> business, not a woman's. All I'm interested in now is a good<br> cotton crop. Now take this dollar and buy little Joe a dress. God<br> knows, he needs it. I'm not going to rob you of your corn, for all<br> Alex and Tony's politeness.’<br><br> The boys followed her to the wagon and assisted her in, courtly for<br> all their rags, gay with the volatile Fontaine gaiety, but with the<br> picture of their destitution in her eyes, she shivered as she drove<br> away from Mimosa. She was so tired of poverty and pinching. What<br> a pleasure it would be to know people who were rich and not worried<br> as to where the next meal was coming from!<br><br> Cade Calvert was at home at Pine Bloom and, as Scarlett came up the<br> steps of the old house in which she had danced so often in happier<br> days, she saw that death was in his face. He was emaciated and he<br> coughed as he lay in an easy chair in the sunshine with a shawl<br> across his knees, but his face lit up when he saw her. Just a<br> little cold which had settled in his chest, he said, trying to rise<br> to greet her. Got it from sleeping so much in the rain. But it<br> would be gone soon and then he'd lend a hand in the work.<br><br> Cathleen Calvert, who came out of the house at the sound of voices,<br> met Scarlett's eyes above her brother's head and in them Scarlett<br> read knowledge and bitter despair. Cade might not know but<br> Cathleen knew. Pine Bloom looked straggly and overgrown with<br> weeds, seedling pines were beginning to show in the fields and the<br> house was sagging and untidy. Cathleen was thin and taut.<br><br> The two of them, with their Yankee stepmother, their four little<br> half-sisters, and Hilton, the Yankee overseer, remained in the<br> silent, oddly echoing house. Scarlett had never liked Hilton any<br> more than she liked their own overseer Jonas Wilkerson, and she<br> liked him even less now, as he sauntered forward and greeted her<br> like an equal. Formerly he had the same combination of servility<br> and impertinence which Wilkerson possessed but now, with Mr.<br> Calvert and Raiford dead in the war and Cade sick, he had dropped<br> all servility. The second Mrs. Calvert had never known how to<br> compel respect from negro servants and it was not to be expected<br> that she could get it from a white man.<br><br> ‘Mr. Hilton has been so kind about staying with us through these<br> difficult times,’ said Mrs. Calvert nervously, casting quick<br> glances at her silent stepdaughter. ‘Very kind. I suppose you<br> heard how he saved our house twice when Sherman was here. I'm sure<br> I don't know how we would have managed without him, with no money<br> and Cade--’<br><br> A flush went over Cade's white face and Cathleen's long lashes<br> veiled her eyes as her mouth hardened. Scarlett knew their souls<br> were writhing in helpless rage at being under obligations to their<br> Yankee overseer. Mrs. Calvert seemed ready to weep. She had<br> somehow made a blunder. She was always blundering. She just<br> couldn't understand Southerners, for all that she had lived in<br> Georgia twenty years. She never knew what not to say to her<br> stepchildren and, no matter what she said or did, they were always<br> so exquisitely polite to her. Silently she vowed she would go<br> North to her own people, taking her children with her, and leave<br> these puzzling stiff-necked strangers.<br><br> After these visits, Scarlett had no desire to see the Tarletons.<br> Now that the four boys were gone, the house burned and the family<br> cramped in the overseer's cottage, she could not bring herself to<br> go. But Suellen and Carreen begged and Melanie said it would be<br> unneighborly not to call and welcome Mr. Tarleton back from the<br> war, so one Sunday they went.<br><br> This was the worst of all.<br><br> As they drove up by the ruins of the house, they saw Beatrice<br> Tarleton dressed in a worn riding habit, a crop under her arm,<br> sitting on the top rail of the fence about the paddock, staring<br> moodily at nothing. Beside her perched the bow-legged little negro<br> who had trained her horses and he looked as glum as his mistress.<br> The paddock, once full of frolicking colts and placid brood mares,<br> was empty now except for one mule, the mule Mr. Tarleton had ridden<br> home from the surrender.<br><br> ‘I swear I don't know what to do with myself now that my darlings<br> are gone,’ said Mrs. Tarleton, climbing down from the fence. A<br> stranger might have thought she spoke of her four dead sons, but<br> the girls from Tara knew her horses were in her mind. ‘All my<br> beautiful horses dead. And oh, my poor Nellie! If I just had<br> Nellie! And nothing but a damned mule on the place. A damned<br> mule,’ she repeated, looking indignantly at the scrawny beast.<br> ‘It's an insult to the memory of my blooded darlings to have a mule<br> in their paddock. Mules are misbegotten, unnatural critters and it<br> ought to be illegal to breed them.’<br><br> Jim Tarleton, completely disguised by a bushy beard, came out of<br> the overseer's house to welcome and kiss the girls and his four<br> red-haired daughters in mended dresses streamed out behind him,<br> tripping over the dozen black and tan hounds which ran barking to<br> the door at the sound of strange voices. There was an air of<br> studied and determined cheerfulness about the whole family which<br> brought a colder chill to Scarlett's bones than the bitterness of<br> Mimosa or the deathly brooding of Pine Bloom.<br><br> The Tarletons insisted that the girls stay for dinner, saying they<br> had so few guests these days and wanted to hear all the news.<br> Scarlett did not want to linger, for the atmosphere oppressed her,<br> but Melanie and her two sisters were anxious for a longer visit, so<br> the four stayed for dinner and ate sparingly of the side meat and<br> dried peas which were served them.<br><br> There was laughter about the skimpy fare and the Tarleton girls<br> giggled as they told of makeshifts for clothes, as if they were<br> telling the most amusing of jokes. Melanie met them halfway,<br> surprising Scarlett with her unexpected vivacity as she told of<br> trials at Tara, making light of hardships. Scarlett could hardly<br> speak at all. The room seemed so empty without the four great<br> Tarleton boys, lounging and smoking and teasing. And if it seemed<br> empty to her, what must it seem to the Tarletons who were offering<br> a smiling front to their neighbors?<br><br> Carreen had said little during the meal but when it was over she<br> slipped over to Mrs. Tarleton's side and whispered something. Mrs.<br> Tarleton's face changed and the brittle smile left her lips as she<br> put her arm around Carreen's slender waist. They left the room,<br> and Scarlett, who felt she could not endure the house another<br> minute, followed them. They went down the path through the garden<br> and Scarlett saw they were going toward the burying ground. Well,<br> she couldn't go back to the house now. It would seem too rude.<br> But what on earth did Carreen mean dragging Mrs. Tarleton out to<br> the boys' graves when Beatrice was trying so hard to be brave?<br><br> There were two new marble markers in the brick-inclosed lot under<br> the funereal cedars--so new that no rain had splashed them with red<br> dust.<br><br> ‘We got them last week,’ said Mrs. Tarleton proudly. ‘Mr. Tarleton<br> went to Macon and brought them home in the wagon.’<br><br> Tombstones! And what they must have cost! Suddenly Scarlett did<br> not feel as sorry for the Tarletons as she had at first. Anybody<br> who would waste precious money on tombstones when food was so dear,<br> so almost unattainable, didn't deserve sympathy. And there were<br> several lines carved on each of the stones. The more carving, the<br> more money. The whole family must be crazy! And it had cost<br> money, too, to bring the three boys' bodies home. They had never<br> found Boyd or any trace of him.<br><br> Between the graves of Brent and Stuart was a stone which read:<br> ‘They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death<br> they were not divided.’<br><br> On the other stone were the names of Boyd and Tom with something in<br> Latin which began ‘Dulce et--’ but it meant nothing to Scarlett who<br> had managed to evade Latin at the Fayetteville Academy.<br><br> All that money for tombstones! Why, they were fools! She felt as<br> indignant as if her own money had been squandered.<br><br> Carreen's eyes were shining oddly.<br><br> ‘I think it's lovely,’ she whispered pointing to the first stone.<br><br> Carreen would think it lovely. Anything sentimental stirred her.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Tarleton and her voice was soft, ‘we thought it<br> very fitting--they died almost at the same time. Stuart first and<br> then Brent who caught up the flag he dropped.’<br><br> As the girls drove back to Tara, Scarlett was silent for a while,<br> thinking of what she had seen in the various homes, remembering<br> against her will the County in its glory, with visitors at all the<br> big houses and money plentiful, negroes crowding the quarters and<br> the well-tended fields glorious with cotton.<br><br> ‘In another year, there'll be little pines all over these fields,’<br> she thought and looking toward the encircling forest she shuddered.<br> ‘Without the darkies, it will be all we can do to keep body and<br> soul together. Nobody can run a big plantation without the<br> darkies, and lots of the fields won't be cultivated at all and the<br> woods will take over the fields again. Nobody can plant much<br> cotton, and what will we do then? What'll become of country folks?<br> Town folks can manage somehow. They've always managed. But we<br> country folks will go back a hundred years like the pioneers who<br> had little cabins and just scratched a few acres--and barely<br> existed.<br><br> ‘No--’ she thought grimly, ‘Tara isn't going to be like that. Not<br> even if I have to plow myself. This whole section, this whole<br> state can go back to woods if it wants to, but I won't let Tara go.<br> And I don't intend to waste my money on tombstones or my time<br> crying about the war. We can make out somehow. I know we could<br> make out somehow if the men weren't all dead. Losing the darkies<br> isn't the worst part about this. It's the loss of the men, the<br> young men.’ She thought again of the four Tarletons and Joe<br> Fontaine, of Raiford Calvert and the Munroe brothers and all the<br> boys from Fayetteville and Jonesboro whose names she had read on<br> the casualty lists. ‘If there were just enough men left, we could<br> manage somehow but--’<br><br> Another thought struck her--suppose she wanted to marry again. Of<br> course, she didn't want to marry again. Once was certainly enough.<br> Besides, the only man she'd ever wanted was Ashley and he was<br> married if he was still living. But suppose she would want to<br> marry. Who would there be to marry her? The thought was<br> appalling.<br><br> ‘Melly,’ she said, ‘what's going to happen to Southern girls?’<br><br> ‘What do you mean?’<br><br> ‘Just what I say. What's going to happen to them? There's no one<br> to marry them. Why, Melly, with all the boys dead, there'll be<br> thousands of girls all over the South who'll die old maids.’<br><br> ‘And never have any children,’ added Melanie, to whom this was the<br> most important thing.<br><br> Evidently the thought was not new to Suellen who sat in the back of<br> the wagon, for she suddenly began to cry. She had not heard from<br> Frank Kennedy since Christmas. She did not know if the lack of<br> mail service was the cause, or if he had merely trifled with her<br> affections and then forgotten her. Or maybe he had been killed in<br> the last days of the war! The latter would have been infinitely<br> preferable to his forgetting her, for at least there was some<br> dignity about a dead love, such as Carreen and India Wilkes had,<br> but none about a deserted fiancee.<br><br> ‘Oh, in the name of God, hush!’ said Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Oh, you can talk,’ sobbed Suellen, ‘because you've been married<br> and had a baby and everybody knows some man wanted you. But look<br> at me! And you've got to be mean and throw it up to me that I'm an<br> old maid when I can't help myself. I think you're hateful.’<br><br> ‘Oh, hush! You know how I hate people who bawl all the time. You<br> know perfectly well old Ginger Whiskers isn't dead and that he'll<br> come back and marry you. He hasn't any better sense. But<br> personally, I'd rather be an old maid than marry him.’<br><br> There was silence from the back of the wagon for a while and<br> Carreen comforted her sister with absent-minded pats, for her mind<br> was a long way off, riding paths three years old with Brent<br> Tarleton beside her. There was a glow, an exaltation in her eyes.<br><br> ‘Ah,’ said Melanie, sadly, ‘what will the South be like without all<br> our fine boys? What would the South have been if they had lived?<br> We could use their courage and their energy and their brains.<br> Scarlett, all of us with little boys must raise them to take the<br> places of the men who are gone, to be brave men like them.’<br><br> ‘There will never again be men like them,’ said Carreen softly.<br> ‘No one can take their places.’<br><br> They drove home the rest of the way in silence,<br><br> <br><br> One day not long after this, Cathleen Calvert rode up to Tara at<br> sunset. Her sidesaddle was strapped on as sorry a mule as Scarlett<br> had ever seen, a flop-eared lame brute, and Cathleen was almost as<br> sorry looking as the animal she rode. Her dress was of faded<br> gingham of the type once worn only by house servants, and her<br> sunbonnet was secured under her chin by a piece of twine. She rode<br> up to the front porch but did not dismount, and Scarlett and<br> Melanie, who had been watching the sunset, went down the steps to<br> meet her. Cathleen was as white as Cade had been the day Scarlett<br> called, white and hard and brittle, as if her face would shatter if<br> she spoke. But her back was erect and her head was high as she<br> nodded to them.<br><br> Scarlett suddenly remembered the day of the Wilkes barbecue when<br> she and Cathleen had whispered together about Rhett Butler. How<br> pretty and fresh Cathleen had been that day in a swirl of blue<br> organdie with fragrant roses at her sash and little black velvet<br> slippers laced about her small ankles. And now there was not a<br> trace of that girl in the stiff figure sitting on the mule.<br><br> ‘I won't get down, thank you,’ she said. ‘I just came to tell you<br> that I'm going to be married.’<br><br> ‘What!’<br><br> ‘Who to?’<br><br> ‘Cathy, how grand!’<br><br> ‘When?’<br><br> ‘Tomorrow,’ said Cathleen quietly and there was something in her<br> voice which took the eager smiles from their faces. ‘I came to<br> tell you that I'm going to be married tomorrow, in Jonesboro--and<br> I'm not inviting you all to come.’<br><br> They digested this in silence, looking up at her, puzzled. Then<br> Melanie spoke.<br><br> ‘Is it someone we know, dear?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said Cathleen, shortly. ‘It's Mr. Hilton.’<br><br> ‘Mr. Hilton?’<br><br> ‘Yes, Mr. Hilton, our overseer.’<br><br> Scarlett could not even find voice to say ‘Oh!’ but Cathleen,<br> peering down suddenly at Melanie, said in a low savage voice: ‘If<br> you cry, Melly, I can't stand it. I shall die!’<br><br> Melanie said nothing but patted the foot in its awkward home-made<br> shoe which hung from the stirrup. Her head was low.<br><br> ‘And don't pat me! I can't stand that either.’<br><br> Melanie dropped her hand but still did not look up.<br><br> ‘Well, I must go. I only came to tell you.’ The white brittle<br> mask was back again and she picked up the reins.<br><br> ‘How is Cade?’ asked Scarlett, utterly at a loss but fumbling for<br> some words to break the awkward silence.<br><br> ‘He is dying,’ said Cathleen shortly. There seemed to be no<br> feeling in her voice. ‘And he is going to die in some comfort and<br> peace if I can manage it, without worry about who will take care of<br> me when he's gone. You see, my stepmother and the children are<br> going North for good, tomorrow. Well, I must be going.’<br><br> Melanie looked up and met Cathleen's hard eyes. There were bright<br> tears on Melanie's lashes and understanding in her eyes, and before<br> them, Cathleen's lips curved into the crooked smile of a brave<br> child who tries not to cry. It was all very bewildering to<br> Scarlett who was still trying to grasp the idea that Cathleen<br> Calvert was going to marry an overseer--Cathleen, daughter of a<br> rich planter, Cathleen who, next to Scarlett, had had more beaux<br> than any girl in the County.<br><br> Cathleen bent down and Melanie tiptoed. They kissed. Then<br> Cathleen flapped the bridle reins sharply and the old mule moved<br> off.<br><br> Melanie looked after her, the tears streaming down her face.<br> Scarlett stared, still dazed.<br><br> ‘Melly, is she crazy? You know she can't be in love with him.’<br><br> ‘In love? Oh, Scarlett, don't even suggest such a horrid thing!<br> Oh, poor Cathleen! Poor Cade!’<br><br> ‘Fiddle-dee-dee!’ cried Scarlett, beginning to be irritated. It<br> was annoying that Melanie always seemed to grasp more of situations<br> than she herself did. Cathleen's plight seemed to her more<br> startling than catastrophic. Of course it was no pleasant thought,<br> marrying Yankee white trash, but after all a girl couldn't live<br> alone on a plantation; she had to have a husband to help her run<br> it.<br><br> ‘Melly, it's like I said the other day. There isn't anybody for<br> girls to marry and they've got to marry someone.’<br><br> ‘Oh, they don't have to marry! There's nothing shameful in being a<br> spinster. Look at Aunt Pitty. Oh, I'd rather see Cathleen dead!<br> I know Cade would rather see her dead. It's the end of the<br> Calverts. Just think what her--what their children will be. Oh,<br> Scarlett, have Pork saddle the horse quickly and you ride after her<br> and tell her to come live with us!’<br><br> ‘Good Lord!’ cried Scarlett, shocked at the matter-of-fact way in<br> which Melanie was offering Tara. Scarlett certainly had no<br> intention of feeding another mouth. She started to say this but<br> something in Melanie's stricken face halted the words.<br><br> ‘She wouldn't come, Melly,’ she amended. ‘You know she wouldn't.<br> She's so proud and she'd think it was charity.’<br><br> ‘That's true, that's true!’ said Melanie distractedly, watching the<br> small cloud of red dust disappear down the road.<br><br> ‘You've been with me for months,’ thought Scarlett grimly, looking<br> at her sister-in-law, ‘and it's never occurred to you that it's<br> charity you're living on. And I guess it never will. You're one<br> of those people the war didn't change and you go right on thinking<br> and acting just like nothing had happened--like we were still rich<br> as Croesus and had more food than we know what to do with and<br> guests didn't matter. I guess I've got you on my neck for the rest<br> of my life. But I won't have Cathleen too.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXX<br><br> <br> In that warm summer after peace came, Tara suddenly lost its<br> isolation. And for months thereafter a stream of scarecrows,<br> bearded, ragged, footsore and always hungry, toiled up the red hill<br> to Tara and came to rest on the shady front steps, wanting food and<br> a night's lodging. They were Confederate soldiers walking home.<br> The railroad had carried the remains of Johnston's army from North<br> Carolina to Atlanta and dumped them there, and from Atlanta they<br> began their pilgrimages afoot. When the wave of Johnston's men had<br> passed, the weary veterans from the Army of Virginia arrived and<br> then men from the Western troops, beating their way south toward<br> homes which might not exist and families which might be scattered<br> or dead. Most of them were walking, a few fortunate ones rode bony<br> horses and mules which the terms of the surrender had permitted<br> them to keep, gaunt animals which even an untrained eye could tell<br> would never reach far-away Florida and south Georgia.<br><br> Going home! Going home! That was the only thought in the<br> soldiers' minds. Some were sad and silent, others gay and<br> contemptuous of hardships, but the thought that it was all over and<br> they were going home was the one thing that sustained them. Few of<br> them were bitter. They left bitterness to their women and their<br> old people. They had fought a good fight, had been licked and were<br> willing to settle down peaceably to plowing beneath the flag they<br> had fought.<br><br> Going home! Going home! They could talk of nothing else, neither<br> battles nor wounds, nor imprisonment nor the future. Later, they<br> would refight battles and tell children and grandchildren of pranks<br> and forays and charges, of hunger, forced marches and wounds, but<br> not now. Some of them lacked an arm or a leg or an eye, many had<br> scars which would ache in rainy weather if they lived for seventy<br> years but these seemed small matters now. Later it would be<br> different.<br><br> Old and young, talkative and taciturn, rich planter and sallow<br> Cracker, they all had two things in common, lice and dysentery.<br> The Confederate soldier was so accustomed to his verminous state he<br> did not give it a thought and scratched unconcernedly even in the<br> presence of ladies. As for dysentery--the ‘bloody flux’ as the<br> ladies delicately called it--it seemed to have spared no one from<br> private to general. Four years of half-starvation, four years of<br> rations which were coarse or green or half-putrefied, had done its<br> work with them and every soldier who stopped at Tara was either<br> just recovering or was actively suffering from it.<br><br> ‘Dey ain' a soun' set of bowels in de whole Confedrut ahmy,’<br> observed Mammy darkly as she sweated over the fire, brewing a<br> bitter concoction of blackberry roots which had been Ellen's<br> sovereign remedy for such afflictions. ‘It's mah notion dat<br> 'twarn't de Yankees whut beat our gempmum. 'Twuz dey own innards.<br> Kain no gempmum fight wid his bowels tuhnin' ter water.’<br><br> One and all, Mammy dosed them, never waiting to ask foolish<br> questions about the state of their organs and, one and all, they<br> drank her doses meekly and with wry faces, remembering, perhaps,<br> other stern black faces in far-off places and other inexorable<br> black hands holding medicine spoons.<br><br> In the matter of ‘comp'ny’ Mammy was equally adamant. No lice-<br> ridden soldier should come into Tara. She marched them behind a<br> clump of thick bushes, relieved them of their uniforms, gave them a<br> basin of water and strong lye soap to wash with and provided them<br> with quilts and blankets to cover their nakedness, while she boiled<br> their clothing in her huge wash pot. It was useless for the girls<br> to argue hotly that such conduct humiliated the soldiers. Mammy<br> replied that the girls would be a sight more humiliated if they<br> found lice upon themselves.<br><br> When the soldiers began arriving almost daily, Mammy protested<br> against their being allowed to use the bedrooms. Always she feared<br> lest some louse had escaped her. Rather than argue the matter,<br> Scarlett turned the parlor with its deep velvet rug into a<br> dormitory. Mammy cried out equally loudly at the sacrilege of<br> soldiers being permitted to sleep on Miss Ellen's rug but Scarlett<br> was firm. They had to sleep somewhere. And, in the months after<br> the surrender, the deep soft nap began to show signs of wear and<br> finally the heavy warp and woof showed through in spots where heels<br> had worn it and spurs dug carelessly.<br><br> Of each soldier, they asked eagerly of Ashley. Suellen, bridling,<br> always asked news of Mr. Kennedy. But none of the soldiers had<br> ever heard of them nor were they inclined to talk about the<br> missing. It was enough that they themselves were alive, and they<br> did not care to think of the thousands in unmarked graves who would<br> never come home.<br><br> The family tried to bolster Melanie's courage after each of these<br> disappointments. Of course, Ashley hadn't died in prison. Some<br> Yankee chaplain would have written if this were true. Of course,<br> he was coming home but his prison was so far away. Why, goodness,<br> it took days riding on a train to make the trip and if Ashley was<br> walking, like these men . . . Why hadn't he written? Well,<br> darling, you know what the mails are now--so uncertain and slipshod<br> even where mail routes are re-established. But suppose--suppose he<br> had died on the way home. Now, Melanie, some Yankee woman would<br> have surely written us about it! . . . Yankee women! Bah! . . .<br> Melly, there ARE some nice Yankee women. Oh, yes, there are! God<br> couldn't make a whole nation without having some nice women in it!<br> Scarlett, you remember we did meet a nice Yankee woman at Saratoga<br> that time--Scarlett, tell Melly about her!<br><br> ‘Nice, my foot!’ replied Scarlert. ‘She asked me how many<br> bloodhounds we kept to chase our darkies with! I agree with Melly.<br> I never saw a nice Yankee, male or female. But don't cry, Melly!<br> Ashley'll come home. It's a long walk and maybe--maybe he hasn't<br> got any boots.’<br><br> Then at the thought of Ashley barefooted, Scarlett could have<br> cried. Let other soldiers limp by in rags with their feet tied up<br> in sacks and strips of carpet, but not Ashley. He should come home<br> on a prancing horse, dressed in fine clothes and shining boots, a<br> plume in his hat. It was the final degradation for her to think of<br> Ashley reduced to the state of these other soldiers.<br><br> One afternoon in June when everyone at Tara was assembled on the<br> back porch eagerly watching Pork cut the first half-ripe watermelon<br> of the season, they heard hooves on the gravel of the front drive.<br> Prissy started languidly toward the front door, while those left<br> behind argued hotly as to whether they should hide the melon or<br> keep it for supper, should the caller at the door prove to be a<br> soldier.<br><br> Melly and Carreen whispered that the soldier guest should have a<br> share and Scarlett, backed by Suellen and Mammy, hissed to Pork to<br> hide it quickly.<br><br> ‘Don't be a goose, girls! There's not enough for us as it is and<br> if there are two or three famished soldiers out there, none of us<br> will even get a taste,’ said Scarlett.<br><br> While Pork stood with the little melon clutched to him, uncertain<br> as to the final decision, they heard Prissy cry out.<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty! Miss Scarlett! Miss Melly! Come quick!’<br><br> ‘Who is it?’ cried Scarlett, leaping up from the steps and racing<br> through the hall with Melly at her shoulder and the others<br> streaming after her.<br><br> Ashley! she thought. Oh, perhaps--<br><br> ‘It's Uncle Peter! Miss Pittypat's Uncle Peter!’<br><br> They all ran out to the front porch and saw the tall grizzled old<br> despot of Aunt Pitty's house climbing down from a rat-tailed nag on<br> which a section of quilting had been strapped. On his wide black<br> face, accustomed dignity strove with delight at seeing old friends,<br> with the result that his brow was furrowed in a frown but his mouth<br> was hanging open like a happy toothless old hound's.<br><br> Everyone ran down the steps to greet him, black and white shaking<br> his hand and asking questions, but Melly's voice rose above them<br> all.<br><br> ‘Auntie isn't sick, is she?’<br><br> ‘No'm. She's po'ly, thank God,’ answered Peter, fastening a severe<br> look first on Melly and then on Scarlett, so that they suddenly<br> felt guilty but could think of no reason why. ‘She's po'ly but she<br> is plum outdone wid you young Misses, an' ef it come right down to<br> it, Ah is too!’<br><br> ‘Why! Uncle Peter! What on earth--’<br><br> ‘Y'all nee'n try ter 'scuse you'seffs. Ain' Miss Pitty writ you<br> an' writ you ter come home? Ain' Ah seed her write an' seed her<br> a-cryin' w'en y'all writ her back dat you got too much ter do on<br> disyere ole farm ter come home?’<br><br> ‘But, Uncle Peter--’<br><br> ‘Huccome you leave Miss Pitty by herseff lak dis w'en she so scary<br> lak? You know well's Ah do Miss Pitty ain' never live by herseff<br> an' she been shakin' in her lil shoes ever since she come back frum<br> Macom. She say fer me ter tell y'all plain as Ah knows how dat she<br> jes' kain unnerstan' y'all desertin' her in her hour of need.’<br><br> ‘Now, hesh!’ said Mammy tartly, for it sat ill upon her to hear<br> Tara referred to as an ‘ole farm.’ Trust an ignorant city-bred<br> darky not to know the difference between a farm and a plantation.<br> ‘Ain' us got no hours of need? Ain' us needin' Miss Scarlett an'<br> Miss Melly right hyah an' needin' dem bad? Huccome Miss Pitty doan<br> ast her brudder fer 'sistance, does she need any?’<br><br> Uncle Peter gave her a withering look.<br><br> ‘Us ain' had nuthin' ter do wid Mist' Henry fer y'ars, an' us is<br> too ole ter start now.’ He turned back to the girls, who were<br> trying to suppress their smiles. ‘You young Misses ought ter tek<br> shame, leavin' po' Miss Pitty 'lone, wid half her frens daid an' de<br> other half in Macom, an' 'Lanta full of Yankee sojers an' trashy<br> free issue niggers.’<br><br> The two girls had borne the castigation with straight faces as long<br> as they could, but the thought of Aunt Pitty sending Peter to scold<br> them and bring them back bodily to Atlanta was too much for their<br> control. They burst into laughter and hung on each other's<br> shoulders for support. Naturally, Pork and Dilcey and Mammy gave<br> vent to loud guffaws at hearing the detractor of their beloved Tara<br> set at naught. Suellen and Carreen giggled and even Gerald's face<br> wore a vague smile. Everyone laughed except Peter, who shifted<br> from one large splayed foot to the other in mounting indignation.<br><br> ‘Whut's wrong wid you, nigger?’ inquired Mammy with a grin. ‘Is<br> you gittin' too ole ter perteck yo' own Missus?’<br><br> Peter was outraged.<br><br> ‘Too ole! Me too ole? No, Ma'm! Ah kin perteck Miss Pitty lak Ah<br> allus done. Ain' Ah perteck her down ter Macom when us refugeed?<br> Ain' Ah perteck her w'en de Yankees come ter Macom an' she so<br> sceered she faintin' all de time? An' ain' Ah 'quire disyere nag<br> ter bring her back ter 'Lanta an' perteck her an' her pa's silver<br> all de way?’ Peter drew himself to his full height as he<br> vindicated himself. ‘Ah ain' talkin' about perteckin'. Ah's<br> talkin' 'bout how it LOOK.’<br><br> ‘How who look?’<br><br> ‘Ah'm talkin' 'bout how it look ter folks, seein' Miss Pitty livin'<br> 'lone. Folks talks scan'lous 'bout maiden ladies dat lives by<br> deyseff,’ continued Peter, and it was obvious to his listeners that<br> Pittypat, in his mind, was still a plump and charming miss of<br> sixteen who must be sheltered against evil tongues. ‘An' Ah ain'<br> figgerin' on havin' folks criticize her. No, ma'm . . . An' Ah<br> ain' figgerin' on her takin' in no bo'ders, jes' fer comp'ny<br> needer. Ah done tole her dat. 'Not w'ile you got yo' flesh an'<br> blood dat belongs wid you,' Ah says. An' now her flesh an' blood<br> denyin' her. Miss Pitty ain' nuthin' but a chile an'--’<br><br> At this, Scarlett and Melly whooped louder and sank down to the<br> steps. Finally Melly wiped tears of mirth from her eyes.<br><br> ‘Poor Uncle Peter! I'm sorry I laughed. Really and truly. There!<br> Do forgive me. Miss Scarlett and I just can't come home now.<br> Maybe I'll come in September after the cotton is picked. Did<br> Auntie send you all the way down here just to bring us back on that<br> bag of bones?’<br><br> At this question, Peter's jaw suddenly dropped and guilt and<br> consternation swept over his wrinkled black face. His protruding<br> underlip retreated to normal as swiftly as a turtle withdraws its<br> head beneath its shell.<br><br> ‘Miss Melly. Ah is gittin' ole, Ah spec', 'cause Ah clean fergit<br> fer de moment whut she sent me fer, an' it's important too. Ah got<br> a letter fer you. Miss Pitty wouldn' trust de mails or nobody but<br> me ter bring it an'--’<br><br> ‘A letter? For me? Who from?’<br><br> ‘Well'm, it's--Miss Pitty, she says ter me, 'You, Peter, you brek<br> it gen'ly ter Miss Melly,' an' Ah say--’<br><br> Melly rose from the steps, her hand at her heart.<br><br> ‘Ashley! Ashley! He's dead!’<br><br> ‘No'm! No'm!’ cried Peter, his voice rising to a shrill bawl, as<br> he fumbled in the breast pocket of his ragged coat. ‘He's 'live!<br> Disyere a letter frum him. He comin' home. He-- Gawdlmighty!<br> Ketch her, Mammy! Lemme--’<br><br> ‘Doan you tech her, you ole fool!’ thundered Mammy, struggling to<br> keep Melanie's sagging body from falling to the ground. ‘You pious<br> black ape! Brek it gen'ly! You, Poke, tek her feet. Miss<br> Carreen, steady her haid. Lessus lay her on de sofa in de parlor.’<br><br> There was a tumult of sound as everyone but Scarlett swarmed about<br> the fainting Melanie, everyone crying out in alarm, scurrying into<br> the house for water and pillows, and in a moment Scarlett and Uncle<br> Peter were left standing alone on the walk. She stood rooted,<br> unable to move from the position to which she had leaped when she<br> heard his words, staring at the old man who stood feebly waving a<br> letter. His old black face was as pitiful as a child's under its<br> mother's disapproval, his dignity collapsed.<br><br> For a moment she could not speak or move, and though her mind<br> shouted: ‘He isn't dead! He's coming home!’ the knowledge brought<br> neither joy nor excitement, only a stunned immobility. Uncle<br> Peter's voice came as from a far distance, plaintive, placating.<br><br> ‘Mist' Willie Burr frum Macom whut is kin ter us, he brung it ter<br> Miss Pitty. Mist' Willie he in de same jail house wid Mist'<br> Ashley. Mist' Willie he got a hawse an' he got hyah soon. But<br> Mist' Ashley he a-walkin' an'--’<br><br> Scarlett snatched the letter from his hand. It was addressed to<br> Melly in Miss Pitty's writing but that did not make her hesitate a<br> moment. She ripped it open and Miss Pitty's inclosed note fell to<br> the ground. Within the envelope there was a piece of folded paper,<br> grimy from the dirty pocket in which it had been carried, creased<br> and ragged about the edges. It bore the inscription in Ashley's<br> hand: ‘Mrs. George Ashley Wilkes, Care Miss Sarah Jane Hamilton,<br> Atlanta, or Twelve Oaks, Jonesboro, Ga.’<br><br> With fingers that shook, she opened it and read:<br><br> ‘Beloved, I am coming home to you--’<br><br> Tears began to stream down her face so that she could not read and<br> her heart swelled up until she felt she could not bear the joy of<br> it. Clutching the letter to her, she raced up the porch steps and<br> down the hall, past the parlor where all the inhabitants of Tara<br> were getting in one another's way as they worked over the<br> unconscious Melanie, and into Ellen's office. She shut the door<br> and locked it and flung herself down on the sagging old sofa<br> crying, laughing, kissing the letter.<br><br> ‘Beloved,’ she whispered, ‘I am coming home to you.’<br><br> <br><br> Common sense told them that unless Ashley developed wings, it would<br> be weeks or even months before he could travel from Illinois to<br> Georgia, but hearts nevertheless beat wildly whenever a soldier<br> turned into the avenue at Tara. Each bearded scarecrow might be<br> Ashley. And if it were not Ashley, perhaps the soldier would have<br> news of him or a letter from Aunt Pitty about him. Black and<br> white, they rushed to the front porch every time they heard<br> footsteps. The sight of a uniform was enough to bring everyone<br> flying from the woodpile, the pasture and the cotton patch. For a<br> month after the letter came, work was almost at a standstill. No<br> one wanted to be out of the house when he arrived. Scarlett least<br> of all. And she could not insist on the others attending to their<br> duties when she so neglected hers.<br><br> But when the weeks crawled by and Ashley did not come or any news<br> of him, Tara settled back into its old routine. Longing hearts<br> could only stand so much of longing. An uneasy fear crept into<br> Scarlett's mind that something had happened to him along the way.<br> Rock Island was so far away and he might have been weak or sick<br> when released from prison. And he had no money and was tramping<br> through a country where Confederates were hated. If only she knew<br> where he was, she would send money to him, send every penny she had<br> and let the family go hungry, so he could come home swiftly on the<br> train.<br><br> ‘Beloved, I am coming home to you.’<br><br> In the first rush of joy when her eyes met those words, they had<br> meant only that Ashley was coming home to her. Now, in the light<br> of cooler reason, it was Melanie to whom he was returning, Melanie<br> who went about the house these days singing with joy. Occasionally,<br> Scarlett wondered bitterly why Melanie could not have died in<br> childbirth in Atlanta. That would have made things perfect. Then<br> she could have married Ashley after a decent interval and made<br> little Beau a good stepmother too. When such thoughts came she did<br> not pray hastily to God, telling Him she did not mean it. God did<br> not frighten her any more.<br><br> Soldiers came singly and in pairs and dozens and they were always<br> hungry. Scarlett thought despairingly that a plague of locusts<br> would be more welcome. She cursed again the old custom of<br> hospitality which had flowered in the era of plenty, the custom<br> which would not permit any traveler, great or humble, to go on his<br> journey without a night's lodging, food for himself and his horse<br> and the utmost courtesy the house could give. She knew that era<br> had passed forever, but the rest of the household did not, nor did<br> the soldiers, and each soldier was welcomed as if he were a long-<br> awaited guest.<br><br> As the never-ending line went by, her heart hardened. They were<br> eating the food meant for the mouths of Tara, vegetables over whose<br> long rows she had wearied her back, food she had driven endless<br> miles to buy. Food was so hard to get and the money in the<br> Yankee's wallet would not last forever. Only a few greenbacks and<br> the two gold pieces were left now. Why should she feed this horde<br> of hungry men? The war was over. They would never again stand<br> between her and danger. So, she gave orders to Pork that when<br> soldiers were in the house, the table should be set sparely. This<br> order prevailed until she noticed that Melanie, who had never been<br> strong since Beau was born, was inducing Pork to put only dabs of<br> food on her plate and giving her share to the soldiers.<br><br> ‘You'll have to stop it, Melanie,’ she scolded. ‘You're half sick<br> yourself and if you don't eat more, you'll be sick in bed and we'll<br> have to nurse you. Let these men go hungry. They can stand it.<br> They've stood it for four years and it won't hurt them to stand it<br> a little while longer.’<br><br> Melanie turned to her and on her face was the first expression of<br> naked emotion Scarlett had ever seen in those serene eyes.<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett, don't scold me! Let me do it. You don't know how<br> it helps me. Every time I give some poor man my share I think that<br> maybe, somewhere on the road up north, some woman is giving my<br> Ashley a share of her dinner and it's helping him to get home to<br> me!’<br><br> ‘My Ashley.’<br><br> ‘Beloved, I am coming home to you.’<br><br> Scarlett turned away, wordless. After that, Melanie noticed there<br> was more food on the table when guests were present, even though<br> Scarlett might grudge them every mouthful.<br><br> When the soldiers were too ill to go on, and there were many such,<br> Scarlett put them to bed with none too good grace. Each sick man<br> meant another mouth to feed. Someone had to nurse him and that<br> meant one less worker at the business of fence building, hoeing,<br> weeding and plowing. One boy, on whose face a blond fuzz had just<br> begun to sprout, was dumped on the front porch by a mounted soldier<br> bound for Fayetteville. He had found him unconscious by the<br> roadside and had brought him, across his saddle, to Tara, the<br> nearest house. The girls thought he must be one of the little<br> cadets who had been called out of military school when Sherman<br> approached Milledgeville but they never knew, for he died without<br> regaining consciousness and a search of his pockets yielded no<br> information.<br><br> A nice-looking boy, obviously a gentleman, and somewhere to the<br> south, some woman was watching the roads, wondering where he was<br> and when he was coming home, just as she and Melanie, with a wild<br> hope in their hearts, watched every bearded figure that came up<br> their walk. They buried the cadet in the family burying ground,<br> next to the three little O'Hara boys, and Melanie cried sharply as<br> Pork filled in the grave, wondering in her heart if strangers were<br> doing this same thing to the tall body of Ashley.<br><br> Will Benteen was another soldier, like the nameless boy, who<br> arrived unconscious across the saddle of a comrade. Will was<br> acutely ill with pneumonia and when the girls put him to bed, they<br> feared he would soon join the boy in the burying ground.<br><br> He had the sallow malarial face of the south Georgia Cracker, pale<br> pinkish hair and washed-out blue eyes which even in delirium were<br> patient and mild. One of his legs was gone at the knee and to the<br> stump was fitted a roughly whittled wooden peg. He was obviously a<br> Cracker, just as the boy they had buried so short a while ago was<br> obviously a planter's son. Just how the girls knew this they could<br> not say. Certainly Will was no dirtier, no more hairy, no more<br> lice infested than many fine gentlemen who came to Tara. Certainly<br> the language he used in his delirium was no less grammatical than<br> that of the Tarleton twins. But they knew instinctively, as they<br> knew thoroughbred horses from scrubs, that he was not of their<br> class. But this knowledge did not keep them from laboring to save<br> him.<br><br> Emaciated from a year in a Yankee prison, exhausted by his long<br> tramp on his ill-fitting wooden peg, he had little strength to<br> combat pneumonia and for days he lay in the bed moaning, trying to<br> get up, fighting battles over again. Never once did he call for<br> mother, wife, sister or sweetheart and this omission worried<br> Carreen.<br><br> ‘A man ought to have some folks,’ she said. ‘And he sounds like he<br> didn't have a soul in the world.’<br><br> For all his lankiness he was tough, and good nursing pulled him<br> through. The day came when his pale blue eyes, perfectly cognizant<br> of his surroundings, fell upon Carreen sitting beside him, telling<br> her rosary beads, the morning sun shining through her fair hair.<br><br> ‘Then you warn't a dream, after all,’ he said, in his flat toneless<br> voice. ‘I hope I ain't troubled you too much, Ma'm.’<br><br> His convalescence was a long one and he lay quietly looking out of<br> the window at the magnolias and causing very little trouble to<br> anyone. Carreen liked him because of his placid and unembarrassed<br> silences. She would sit beside him through the long hot<br> afternoons, fanning him and saying nothing.<br><br> Carreen had very little to say these days as she moved, delicate<br> and wraithlike, about the tasks which were within her strength.<br> She prayed a good deal, for when Scarlett came into her room<br> without knocking, she always found her on her knees by her bed.<br> The sight never failed to annoy her, for Scarlett felt that the<br> time for prayer had passed. If God had seen fit to punish them so,<br> then God could very well do without prayers. Religion had always<br> been a bargaining process with Scarlett. She promised God good<br> behavior in exchange for favors. God had broken the bargain time<br> and again, to her way of thinking, and she felt that she owed Him<br> nothing at all now. And whenever she found Carreen on her knees<br> when she should have been taking an afternoon nap or doing the<br> mending, she felt that Carreen was shirking her share of the<br> burdens.<br><br> She said as much to Will Benteen one afternoon when he was able to<br> sit up in a chair and was startled when he said in his flat voice:<br> ‘Let her be, Miss Scarlett. It comforts her.’<br><br> ‘Comforts her?’<br><br> ‘Yes, she's prayin' for your ma and him.’<br><br> ‘Who is 'him'?’<br><br> His faded blue eyes looked at her from under sandy lashes without<br> surprise. Nothing seemed to surprise or excite him. Perhaps he<br> had seen too much of the unexpected ever to be startled again.<br> That Scarlett did not know what was in her sister's heart did not<br> seem odd to him. He took it as naturally as he did the fact that<br> Carreen had found comfort in talking to him, a stranger.<br><br> ‘Her beau, that boy Brent something-or-other who was killed at<br> Gettysburg.’<br><br> ‘Her beau?’ said Scarlett shortly. ‘Her beau, nothing! He and his<br> brother were my beaux.’<br><br> ‘Yes, so she told me. Looks like most of the County was your<br> beaux. But, all the same, he was her beau after you turned him<br> down, because when he come home on his last furlough they got<br> engaged. She said he was the only boy she'd ever cared about and<br> so it kind of comforts her to pray for him.’<br><br> ‘Well, fiddle-dee-dee!’ said Scarlett, a very small dart of<br> jealousy entering her.<br><br> She looked curiously at this lanky man with his bony stooped<br> shoulders, his pinkish hair and calm unwavering eyes. So he knew<br> things about her own family which she had not troubled to discover.<br> So that was why Carreen mooned about, praying all the time. Well,<br> she'd get over it. Lots of girls got over dead sweethearts, yes,<br> dead husbands, too. She'd certainly gotten over Charles. And she<br> knew one girl in Atlanta who had been widowed three times by the<br> war and was still able to take notice of men. She said as much to<br> Will but he shook his head.<br><br> ‘Not Miss Carreen,’ he said with finality.<br><br> Will was pleasant to talk to because he had so little to say and<br> yet was so understanding a listener. She told him about her<br> problems of weeding and hoeing and planting, of fattening the hogs<br> and breeding the cow, and he gave good advice for he had owned a<br> small farm in south Georgia and two negroes. He knew his slaves<br> were free now and the farm gone to weeds and seedling pines. His<br> sister, his only relative, had moved to Texas with her husband<br> years ago and he was alone in the world. Yet, none of these things<br> seemed to bother him any more than the leg he had left in Virginia.<br><br> Yes, Will was a comfort to Scarlett after hard days when the<br> negroes muttered and Suellen nagged and cried and Gerald asked too<br> frequently where Ellen was. She could tell Will anything. She<br> even told him of killing the Yankee and glowed with pride when he<br> commented briefly: ‘Good work!’<br><br> Eventually all the family found their way to Will's room to air<br> their troubles--even Mammy, who had at first been distant with him<br> because he was not quality and had owned only two slaves.<br><br> When he was able to totter about the house, he turned his hands to<br> weaving baskets of split oak and mending the furniture ruined by<br> the Yankees. He was clever at whittling and Wade was constantly by<br> his side, for he whittled out toys for him, the only toys the<br> little boy had. With Will in the house, everyone felt safe in<br> leaving Wade and the two babies while they went about their tasks,<br> for he could care for them as deftly as Mammy and only Melly<br> surpassed him at soothing the screaming black and white babies.<br><br> ‘You've been mighty good to me, Miss Scarlett,’ he said, ‘and me a<br> stranger and nothin' to you all. I've caused you a heap of trouble<br> and worry and if it's all the same to you, I'm goin' to stay here<br> and help you all with the work till I've paid you back some for<br> your trouble. I can't ever pay it all, 'cause there ain't no<br> payment a man can give for his life.’<br><br> So he stayed and, gradually, unobtrusively, a large part of the<br> burden of Tara shifted from Scarlett's shoulders to the bony<br> shoulders of Will Benteen.<br><br> <br><br> It was September and time to pick the cotton. Will Benteen sat on<br> the front steps at Scarlett's feet in the pleasant sunshine of the<br> early autumn afternoon and his flat voice went on and on languidly<br> about the exorbitant costs of ginning the cotton at the new gin<br> near Fayetteville. However, he had learned that day in<br> Fayetteville that he could cut this expense a fourth by lending the<br> horse and wagon for two weeks to the gin owner. He had delayed<br> closing the bargain until he discussed it with Scarlett.<br><br> She looked at the lank figure leaning against the porch column,<br> chewing a straw. Undoubtedly, as Mammy frequently declared, Will<br> was something the Lord had provided and Scarlett often wondered how<br> Tara could have lived through the last few months without him. He<br> never had much to say, never displayed any energy, never seemed to<br> take much interest in anything that went on about him, but he knew<br> everything about everybody at Tara. And he did things. He did<br> them silently, patiently and competently. Though he had only one<br> leg, he could work faster than Pork. And he could get work out of<br> Pork, which was, to Scarlett, a marvelous thing. When the cow had<br> the colic and the horse fell ill with a mysterious ailment which<br> threatened to remove him permanently from them, Will sat up nights<br> with them and saved them. That he was a shrewd trader brought him<br> Scarlett's respect, for he could ride out in the mornings with a<br> bushel or two of apples, sweet potatoes and other vegetables and<br> return with seeds, lengths of cloth, flour and other necessities<br> which she knew she could never have acquired, good trader though<br> she was.<br><br> He had gradually slipped into the status of a member of the family<br> and slept on a cot in the little dressing room off Gerald's room.<br> He said nothing of leaving Tara, and Scarlett was careful not to<br> question him, fearful that he might leave them. Sometimes, she<br> thought that if he were anybody and had any gumption he would go<br> home, even if he no longer had a home. But even with this thought,<br> she would pray fervently that he would remain indefinitely. It was<br> so convenient to have a man about the house.<br><br> She thought, too, that if Carreen had the sense of a mouse she<br> would see that Will cared for her. Scarlett would have been<br> eternally grateful to Will, had he asked her for Carreen's hand.<br> Of course, before the war, Will would certainly not have been an<br> eligible suitor. He was not of the planter class at all, though he<br> was not poor white. He was just plain Cracker, a small farmer,<br> half-educated, prone to grammatical errors and ignorant of some of<br> the finer manners the O'Haras were accustomed to in gentlemen. In<br> fact, Scarlett wondered if he could be called a gentleman at all<br> and decided that he couldn't. Melanie hotly defended him, saying<br> that anyone who had Will's kind heart and thoughtfulness of others<br> was of gentle birth. Scarlett knew that Ellen would have fainted<br> at the thought of a daughter of hers marrying such a man, but now<br> Scarlett had been by necessity forced too far away from Ellen's<br> teachings to let that worry her. Men were scarce, girls had to<br> marry someone and Tara had to have a man. But Carreen, deeper and<br> deeper immersed in her prayer book and every day losing more of her<br> touch with the world of realities, treated Will as gently as a<br> brother and took him as much for granted as she did Pork.<br><br> ‘If Carreen had any sense of gratitude to me for what I've done for<br> her, she'd marry him and not let him get away from here,’ Scarlett<br> thought indignantly. ‘But no, she must spend her time mooning<br> about a silly boy who probably never gave her a serious thought.’<br><br> So Will remained at Tara, for what reason she did not know and she<br> found his businesslike man-to-man attitude with her both pleasant<br> and helpful. He was gravely deferential to the vague Gerald but it<br> was to Scarlett that he turned as the real head of the house.<br><br> She gave her approval to the plan of hiring out the horse even<br> though it meant the family would be without any means of<br> transportation temporarily. Suellen would be especially grieved at<br> this. Her greatest joy lay in going to Jonesboro or Fayetteville<br> with Will when he drove over on business. Adorned in the assembled<br> best of the family, she called on old friends, heard all the gossip<br> of the County and felt herself again Miss O'Hara of Tara. Suellen<br> never missed the opportunity to leave the plantation and give<br> herself airs among people who did not know she weeded the garden<br> and made beds.<br><br> Miss Fine Airs will just have to do without gadding for two weeks,<br> thought Scarlett, and we'll have to put up with her nagging and her<br> bawling.<br><br> Melanie joined them on the veranda, the baby in her arms, and<br> spreading an old blanket on the floor, set little Beau down to<br> crawl. Since Ashley's letter Melanie had divided her time between<br> glowing, singing happiness and anxious longing. But happy or<br> depressed, she was too thin, too white. She did her share of the<br> work uncomplainingly but she was always ailing. Old Dr. Fontaine<br> diagnosed her trouble as female complaint and concurred with Dr.<br> Meade in saying she should never have had Beau. And he said<br> frankly that another baby would kill her.<br><br> ‘When I was over to Fayetteville today,’ said Will, ‘I found<br> somethin' right cute that I thought would interest you ladies and I<br> brought it home.’ He fumbled in his back pants pocket and brought<br> out the wallet of calico, stiffened with bark, which Carreen had<br> made him. From it, he drew a Confederate bill.<br><br> ‘If you think Confederate money is cute, Will, I certainly don't,’<br> said Scarlett shortly, for the very sight of Confederate money made<br> her mad. ‘We've got three thousand dollars of it in Pa's trunk<br> this minute, and Mammy's after me to let her paste it over the<br> holes in the attic walls so the draft won't get her. And I think<br> I'll do it. Then it'll be good for something.’<br><br> ‘'Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,'‘ said Melanie with a<br> sad smile. ‘Don't do that, Scarlett. Keep it for Wade. He'll be<br> proud of it some day.’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know nothin' about imperious Caesar,’ said Will,<br> patiently, ‘but what I've got is in line with what you've just said<br> about Wade, Miss Melly. It's a poem, pasted on the back of this<br> bill. I know Miss Scarlett ain't much on poems but I thought this<br> might interest her.’<br><br> He turned the bill over. On its back was pasted a strip of coarse<br> brown wrapping paper, inscribed in pale homemade ink. Will cleared<br> his throat and read slowly and with difficulty.<br><br> ‘The name is 'Lines on the Back of a Confederate Note,'‘ he said.<br><br> <br> ‘Representing nothing on God's earth now<br> And naught in the waters below it--<br> As the pledge of nation that's passed away<br> Keep it, dear friend, and show it.<br><br> Show it to those who will lend an ear<br> To the tale this trifle will tell<br> Of Liberty, born of patriots' dream,<br> Of a storm-cradled nation that fell.’<br><br> <br> ‘Oh, how beautiful! How touching!’ cried Melanie. ‘Scarlett, you<br> mustn't give the money to Mammy to paste in the attic. It's more<br> than paper--just like this poem said: 'The pledge of a nation<br> that's passed away!'‘<br><br> ‘Oh, Melly, don't be sentimental! Paper is paper and we've got<br> little enough of it and I'm tired of hearing Mammy grumble about<br> the cracks in the attic. I hope when Wade grows up I'll have<br> plenty of greenbacks to give him instead of Confederate trash.’<br><br> Will, who had been enticing little Beau across the blanket with the<br> bill during this argument, looked up and, shading his eyes, glanced<br> down the driveway.<br><br> ‘More company,’ he said, squinting in the sun. ‘Another soldier.’<br><br> Scarlett followed his gaze and saw a familiar sight, a bearded man<br> coming slowly up the avenue under the cedars, a man clad in a<br> ragged mixture of blue and gray uniforms, head bowed tiredly, feet<br> dragging slowly.<br><br> ‘I thought we were about through with soldiers,’ she said. ‘I hope<br> this one isn't very hungry.’<br><br> ‘He'll be hungry,’ said Will briefly.<br><br> Melanie rose.<br><br> ‘I'd better tell Dilcey to set an extra plate,’ she said, ‘and warn<br> Mammy not to get the poor thing's clothes off his back too abruptly<br> and--’<br><br> She stopped so suddenly that Scarlett turned to look at her.<br> Melanie's thin hand was at her throat, clutching it as if it was<br> torn with pain, and Scarlett could see the veins beneath the white<br> skin throbbing swiftly. Her face went whiter and her brown eyes<br> dilated enormously.<br><br> She's going to faint, thought Scarlett, leaping to her feet and<br> catching her arm.<br><br> But, in an instant, Melanie threw off her hand and was down the<br> steps. Down the graveled path she flew, skimming lightly as a<br> bird, her faded skirts streaming behind her, her arms outstretched.<br> Then, Scarlett knew the truth, with the impact of a blow. She<br> reeled back against an upright of the porch as the man lifted a<br> face covered with a dirty blond beard and stopped still, looking<br> toward the house as if he was too weary to take another step. Her<br> heart leaped and stopped and then began racing, as Melly with<br> incoherent cries threw herself into the dirty soldier's arms and<br> his head bent down toward hers. With rapture, Scarlett took two<br> running steps forward but was checked when Will's hand closed upon<br> her skirt.<br><br> ‘Don't spoil it,’ he said quietly.<br><br> ‘Turn me loose, you fool! Turn me loose! It's Ashley!’<br><br> He did not relax his grip.<br><br> ‘After all, he's HER husband, ain't he?’ Will asked calmly and,<br> looking down at him in a confusion of joy and impotent fury,<br> Scarlett saw in the quiet depths of his eyes understanding and<br> pity.lease get in touch at info@retin.ae</p><br>PART FOUR<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXI<br><br> <br> On a cold January afternoon in 1866, Scarlett sat in the office<br> writing a letter to Aunt Pitty, explaining in detail for the tenth<br> time why neither she, Melanie nor Ashley could come back to Atlanta<br> to live with her. She wrote impatiently because she knew Aunt<br> Pitty would read no farther than the opening lines and then write<br> her again, wailing: ‘But I'm afraid to live by myself!’<br><br> Her hands were chilled and she paused to rub them together and to<br> scuff her feet deeper into the strip of old quilting wrapped about<br> them. The soles of her slippers were practically gone and were<br> reinforced with pieces of carpet. The carpet kept her feet off the<br> floor but did little to keep them warm. That morning Will had<br> taken the horse to Jonesboro to get him shod. Scarlett thought<br> grimly that things were indeed at a pretty pass when horses had<br> shoes and people's feet were as bare as yard dogs'.<br><br> She picked up her quill to resume her writing but laid it down when<br> she heard Will coming in at the back door. She heard the thump-<br> thump of his wooden leg in the hall outside the office and then he<br> stopped. She waited for a moment for him to enter and when he made<br> no move she called to him. He came in, his ears red from the cold,<br> his pinkish hair awry, and stood looking down at her, a faintly<br> humorous smile on his lips.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett,’ he questioned, ‘just how much cash money have you<br> got?’<br><br> ‘Are you going to try to marry me for my money, Will?’ she asked<br> somewhat crossly.<br><br> ‘No, Ma'm. But I just wanted to know.’<br><br> She stared at him inquiringly. Will didn't look serious, but then<br> he never looked serious. However, she felt that something was<br> wrong.<br><br> ‘I've got ten dollars in gold,’ she said. ‘The last of that<br> Yankee's money.’<br><br> ‘Well, Ma'm, that won't be enough.’<br><br> ‘Enough for what?’<br><br> ‘Enough for the taxes,’ he answered and, stumping over to the<br> fireplace, he leaned down and held his red hands to the blaze.<br><br> ‘Taxes?’ she repeated. ‘Name of God, Will! We've already paid the<br> taxes.’<br><br> ‘Yes'm. But they say you didn't pay enough. I heard about it<br> today over to Jonesboro.’<br><br> ‘But, Will, I can't understand. What do you mean?’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, I sure hate to bother you with more trouble when<br> you've had your share but I've got to tell you. They say you ought<br> to paid lots more taxes than you did. They're runnin' the<br> assessment up on Tara sky high--higher than any in the County, I'll<br> be bound.’<br><br> ‘But they can't make us pay more taxes when we've already paid them<br> once.’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, you don't never go to Jonesboro often and I'm glad<br> you don't. It ain't no place for a lady these days. But if you'd<br> been there much, you'd know there's a mighty rough bunch of<br> Scallawags and Republicans and Carpetbaggers been runnin' things<br> recently. They'd make you mad enough to pop. And then, too,<br> niggers pushin' white folks off the sidewalks and--’<br><br> ‘But what's that got to do with our taxes?’<br><br> ‘I'm gettin' to it, Miss Scarlett. For some reason the rascals<br> have histed the taxes on Tara till you'd think it was a thousand-<br> bale place. After I heard about it, I sorter oozed around the<br> barrooms pickin' up gossip and I found out that somebody wants to<br> buy in Tara cheap at the sheriff's sale, if you can't pay the extra<br> taxes. And everybody knows pretty well that you can't pay them. I<br> don't know yet who it is wants this place. I couldn't find out.<br> But I think that pusillanimous feller, Hilton, that married Miss<br> Cathleen knows, because he laughed kind of nasty when I tried to<br> sound him out.’<br><br> Will sat down on the sofa and rubbed the stump of his leg. It<br> ached in cold weather and the wooden peg was neither well padded<br> nor comfortable. Scarlett looked at him wildly. His manner was so<br> casual when he was sounding the death knell of Tara. Sold out at<br> the sheriff's sale? Where would they all go? And Tara belonging<br> to some one else! No, that was unthinkable!<br><br> She had been so engrossed with the job of making Tara produce she<br> had paid little heed to what was going on in the world outside.<br> Now that she had Will and Ashley to attend to whatever business she<br> might have in Jonesboro and Fayetteville, she seldom left the<br> plantation. And even as she had listened with deaf ears to her<br> father's war talk in the days before the war came, so she had paid<br> little heed to Will and Ashley's discussions around the table after<br> supper about the beginnings of Reconstruction.<br><br> Oh, of course, she knew about the Scallawags--Southerners who had<br> turned Republican very profitably--and the Carpetbaggers, those<br> Yankees who came South like buzzards after the surrender with all<br> their worldly possessions in one carpetbag. And she had had a few<br> unpleasant experiences with the Freedmen's Bureau. She had<br> gathered, also, that some of the free negroes were getting quite<br> insolent. This last she could hardly believe, for she had never<br> seen an insolent negro in her life.<br><br> But there were many things which Will and Ashley had conspired to<br> keep from her. The scourge of war had been followed by the worse<br> scourge of Reconstruction, but the two men had agreed not to<br> mention the more alarming details when they discussed the situation<br> at home. And when Scarlett took the trouble to listen to them at<br> all, most of what they said went in one ear and out the other.<br><br> She had heard Ashley say that the South was being treated as a<br> conquered province and that vindictiveness was the dominant policy<br> of the conquerors. But that was the kind of statement which meant<br> less than nothing at all to Scarlett. Politics was men's business.<br> She had heard Will say it looked to him like the North just wasn't<br> aiming to let the South get on its feet again. Well, thought<br> Scarlett, men always had to have something foolish to worry about.<br> As far as she was concerned, the Yankees hadn't whipped her once<br> and they wouldn't do it this time. The thing to do was to work<br> like the devil and stop worrying about the Yankee government.<br> After all, the war was over.<br><br> Scarlett did not realize that all the rules of the game had been<br> changed and that honest labor could no longer earn its just reward.<br> Georgia was virtually under martial law now. The Yankee soldiers<br> garrisoned throughout the section and the Freedmen's Bureau were in<br> complete command of everything and they were fixing the rules to<br> suit themselves.<br><br> This Bureau, organized by the Federal government to take care of<br> the idle and excited ex-slaves, was drawing them from the<br> plantations into the villages and cities by the thousands. The<br> Bureau fed them while they loafed and poisoned their minds against<br> their former owners. Gerald's old overseer, Jonas Wilkerson, was<br> in charge of the local Bureau, and his assistant was Hilton,<br> Cathleen Calvert's husband. These two industriously spread the<br> rumor that the Southerners and Democrats were just waiting for a<br> good chance to put the negroes back into slavery and that the<br> negroes' only hope of escaping this fate was the protection given<br> them by the Bureau and the Republican party.<br><br> Wilkerson and Hilton furthermore told the negroes they were as good<br> as the whites in every way and soon white and negro marriages would<br> be permitted, soon the estates of their former owners would be<br> divided and every negro would be given forty acres and a mule for<br> his own. They kept the negroes stirred up with tales of cruelty<br> perpetrated by the whites and, in a section long famed for the<br> affectionate relations between slaves and slave owners, hate and<br> suspicion began to grow.<br><br> The Bureau was backed up by the soldiers and the military had<br> issued many and conflicting orders governing the conduct of the<br> conquered. It was easy to get arrested, even for snubbing the<br> officials of the Bureau. Military orders had been promulgated<br> concerning the schools, sanitation, the kind of buttons one wore on<br> one's suit, the sale of commodities and nearly everything else.<br> Wilkerson and Hilton had the power to interfere in any trade<br> Scarlett might make and to fix their own prices on anything she<br> sold or swapped.<br><br> Fortunately Scarlett had come into contact with the two men very<br> little, for Will had persuaded her to let him handle the trading<br> while she managed the plantation. In his mild-tempered way, Will<br> had straightened out several difficulties of this kind and said<br> nothing to her about them. Will could get along with Carpetbaggers<br> and Yankees--if he had to. But now a problem had arisen which was<br> too big for him to handle. The extra tax assessment and the danger<br> of losing Tara were matters Scarlett had to know about--and right<br> away.<br><br> She looked at him with flashing eyes.<br><br> ‘Oh, damn the Yankees!’ she cried. ‘Isn't it enough that they've<br> licked us and beggared us without turning loose scoundrels on us?’<br><br> The war was over, peace had been declared, but the Yankees could<br> still rob her, they could still starve her, they could still drive<br> her from her house. And fool that she was, she had thought through<br> weary months that if she could just hold out until spring,<br> everything would be all right. This crushing news brought by Will,<br> coming on top of a year of back-breaking work and hope deferred,<br> was the last straw.<br><br> ‘Oh, Will, and I thought our troubles were all over when the war<br> ended!’<br><br> ‘No'm.’ Will raised his lantern-jawed, country-looking face and<br> gave her a long steady look. ‘Our troubles are just gettin'<br> started.’<br><br> ‘How much extra taxes do they want us to pay?’<br><br> ‘Three hundred dollars.’<br><br> She was struck dumb for a moment. Three hundred dollars! It might<br> just as well be three million dollars.<br><br> ‘Why,’ she floundered, ‘why--why, then we've got to raise three<br> hundred, somehow.’<br><br> ‘Yes'm--and a rainbow and a moon or two.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but Will! They couldn't sell out Tara. Why--’<br><br> His mild pale eyes showed more hate and bitterness than she thought<br> possible.<br><br> ‘Oh, couldn't they? Well, they could and they will and they'll<br> like doin' it! Miss Scarlett, the country's gone plumb to hell, if<br> you'll pardon me. Those Carpetbaggers and Scallawags can vote and<br> most of us Democrats can't. Can't no Democrat in this state vote<br> if he was on the tax books for more than two thousand dollars in<br> 'sixty-five. That lets out folks like your pa and Mr. Tarleton and<br> the McRaes and the Fontaine boys. Can't nobody vote who was a<br> colonel and over in the war and, Miss Scarlett, I bet this state's<br> got more colonels than any state in the Confederacy. And can't<br> nobody vote who held office under the Confederate government and<br> that lets out everybody from the notaries to the judges, and the<br> woods are full of folks like that. Fact is, the way the Yankees<br> have framed up that amnesty oath, can't nobody who was somebody<br> before the war vote at all. Not the smart folks nor the quality<br> folks nor the rich folks.<br><br> ‘Huh! I could vote if I took their damned oath. I didn't have any<br> money in 'sixty-five and I certainly warn't a colonel or nothin'<br> remarkable. But I ain't goin' to take their oath. Not by a dinged<br> sight! If the Yankees had acted right, I'd have taken their oath<br> of allegiance but I ain't now. I can be restored to the Union but<br> I can't be reconstructed into it. I ain't goin' to take their oath<br> even if I don't never vote again-- But scum like that Hilton<br> feller, he can vote, and scoundrels like Jonas Wilkerson and pore<br> whites like the Slatterys and no-counts like the MacIntoshes, they<br> can vote. And they're runnin' things now. And if they want to<br> come down on you for extra taxes a dozen times, they can do it.<br> Just like a nigger can kill a white man and not get hung or--’ He<br> paused, embarrassed, and the memory of what had happened to a lone<br> white woman on an isolated farm near Lovejoy was in both their<br> minds. . . . ‘Those niggers can do anything against us and the<br> Freedmen's Bureau and the soldiers will back them up with guns and<br> we can't vote or do nothin' about it.’<br><br> ‘Vote!’ she cried. ‘Vote! What on earth has voting got to do with<br> all this, Will? It's taxes we're talking about. . . . Will,<br> everybody knows what a good plantation Tara is. We could mortgage<br> it for enough to pay the taxes, if we had to.’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, you ain't any fool but sometimes you talk like one.<br> Who's got any money to lend you on this property? Who except the<br> Carpetbaggers who are tryin' to take Tara away from you? Why,<br> everybody's got land. Everybody's land pore. You can't give away<br> land.’<br><br> ‘I've got those diamond earbobs I got off that Yankee. We could<br> sell them.’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, who 'round here has got money for earbobs? Folks<br> ain't got money to buy side meat, let alone gewgaws. If you've got<br> ten dollars in gold, I take oath that's more than most folks have<br> got.’<br><br> They were silent again and Scarlett felt as if she were butting her<br> head against a stone wall. There had been so many stone walls to<br> butt against this last year.<br><br> ‘What are we goin' to do, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘I don't know,’ she said dully and felt that she didn't care. This<br> was one stone wall too many and she suddenly felt so tired that her<br> bones ached. Why should she work and struggle and wear herself<br> out? At the end of every struggle it seemed that defeat was<br> waiting to mock her.<br><br> ‘I don't know,’ she said. ‘But don't let Pa know. It might worry<br> him.’<br><br> ‘I won't.’<br><br> ‘Have you told anyone?’<br><br> ‘No, I came right to you.’<br><br> Yes, she thought, everyone always came right to her with bad news<br> and she was tired of it.<br><br> ‘Where is Mr. Wilkes? Perhaps he'll have some suggestion.’<br><br> Will turned his mild gaze on her and she felt, as from the first<br> day when Ashley came home, that he knew everything.<br><br> ‘He's down in the orchard splittin' rails. I heard his axe when I<br> was puttin' up the horse. But he ain't got any money any more than<br> we have.’<br><br> ‘If I want to talk to him about it, I can, can't I?’ she snapped,<br> rising to her feet and kicking the fragment of quilting from her<br> ankles.<br><br> Will did not take offense but continued rubbing his hands before<br> the flame. ‘Better get your shawl, Miss Scarlett. It's raw<br> outside.’<br><br> But she went without the shawl, for it was upstairs and her need to<br> see Ashley and lay her troubles before him was too urgent to wait.<br><br> How lucky for her if she could find him alone! Never once since<br> his return had she had a private word with him. Always the family<br> clustered about him, always Melanie was by his side, touching his<br> sleeve now and again to reassure herself he was really there. The<br> sight of that happy possessive gesture had aroused in Scarlett all<br> the jealous animosity which had slumbered during the months when<br> she had thought Ashley probably dead. Now she was determined to<br> see him alone. This time no one was going to prevent her from<br> talking with him alone.<br><br> <br><br> She went through the orchard under the bare boughs and the damp<br> weeds beneath them wet her feet. She could hear the sound of the<br> axe ringing as Ashley split into rails the logs hauled from the<br> swamp. Replacing the fences the Yankees had so blithely burned was<br> a long hard task. Everything was a long hard task, she thought<br> wearily, and she was tired of it, tired and mad and sick of it all.<br> If only Ashley were her husband, instead of Melanie's, how sweet it<br> would be to go to him and lay her head upon his shoulder and cry<br> and shove her burdens onto him to work out as best he might.<br><br> She rounded a thicket of pomegranate trees which were shaking bare<br> limbs in the cold wind and saw him leaning on his axe, wiping his<br> forehead with the back of his hand. He was wearing the remains of<br> his butternut trousers and one of Gerald's shirts, a shirt which in<br> better times went only to Court days and barbecues, a ruffled shirt<br> which was far too short for its present owner. He had hung his<br> coat on a tree limb, for the work was hot, and he stood resting as<br> she came up to him.<br><br> At the sight of Ashley in rags, with an axe in his hand, her heart<br> went out in a surge of love and of fury at fate. She could not<br> bear to see him in tatters, working, her debonaire immaculate<br> Ashley. His hands were not made for work or his body for anything<br> but broadcloth and fine linen. God intended him to sit in a great<br> house, talking with pleasant people, playing the piano and writing<br> things which sounded beautiful and made no sense whatsoever.<br><br> She could endure the sight of her own child in aprons made of<br> sacking and the girls in dingy old gingham, could bear it that Will<br> worked harder than any field hand, but not Ashley. He was too fine<br> for all this, too infinitely dear to her. She would rather split<br> logs herself than suffer while he did it.<br><br> ‘They say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails,’ he said as<br> she came up to him. ‘Just think to what heights I may climb!’<br><br> She frowned. He was always saying light things like this about<br> their hardships. They were deadly serious matters to her and<br> sometimes she was almost irritated at his remarks.<br><br> Abruptly she told him Will's news, tersely and in short words,<br> feeling a sense of relief as she spoke. Surely, he'd have<br> something helpful to offer. He said nothing but, seeing her<br> shiver, he took his coat and placed it about her shoulders.<br><br> ‘Well,’ she said finally, ‘doesn't it occur to you that we'll have<br> to get the money somewhere?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘but where?’<br><br> ‘I'm asking you,’ she replied, annoyed. The sense of relief at<br> unburdening herself had disappeared. Even if he couldn't help, why<br> didn't he say something comforting, even if it was only: ‘Oh, I'm<br> so sorry.’<br><br> He smiled.<br><br> ‘In all these months since I've been home I've only heard of one<br> person, Rhett Butler, who actually has money,’ he said.<br><br> Aunt Pittypat had written Melanie the week before that Rhett was<br> back in Atlanta with a carriage and two fine horses and pocketfuls<br> of greenbacks. She had intimated, however, that he didn't come by<br> them honestly. Aunt Pitty had a theory, largely shared by Atlanta,<br> that Rhett had managed to get away with the mythical millions of<br> the Confederate treasury.<br><br> ‘Don't let's talk about him,’ said Scarlett shortly. ‘He's a skunk<br> if ever there was one. What's to become of us all?’<br><br> Ashley put down the axe and looked away and his eyes seemed to be<br> journeying to some far-off country where she could not follow.<br><br> ‘I wonder,’ he said. ‘I wonder not only what will become of us at<br> Tara but what will become of everybody in the South.’<br><br> She felt like snapping out abruptly: ‘To hell with everybody in<br> the South! What about us?’ but she remained silent because the<br> tired feeling was back on her more strongly than ever. Ashley<br> wasn't being any help at all.<br><br> ‘In the end what will happen will be what has happened whenever a<br> civilization breaks up. The people who have brains and courage<br> come through and the ones who haven't are winnowed out. At least,<br> it has been interesting, if not comfortable, to witness a<br> Gotterdammerung.’<br><br> ‘A what?’<br><br> ‘A dusk of the gods. Unfortunately, we Southerners did think we<br> were gods.’<br><br> ‘For Heaven's sake, Ashley Wilkes! Don't stand there and talk<br> nonsense at me when it's us who are going to be winnowed out!’<br><br> Something of her exasperated weariness seemed to penetrate his<br> mind, calling it back from its wanderings, for he raised her hands<br> with tenderness and, turning them palm up, looked at the calluses.<br><br> ‘These are the most beautiful hands I know,’ he said and kissed<br> each palm lightly. ‘They are beautiful because they are strong and<br> every callus is a medal, Scarlett, every blister an award for<br> bravery and unselfishness. They've been roughened for all of us,<br> your father, the girls, Melanie, the baby, the negroes and for me.<br> My dear, I know what you are thinking. You're thinking, 'Here<br> stands an impractical fool talking tommyrot about dead gods when<br> living people are in danger.' Isn't that true?’<br><br> She nodded, wishing he would keep on holding her hands forever, but<br> he dropped them.<br><br> ‘And you came to me, hoping I could help you. Well, I can't.’<br><br> His eyes were bitter as he looked toward the axe and the pile of<br> logs.<br><br> ‘My home is gone and all the money that I so took for granted I<br> never realized I had it. And I am fitted for nothing in this<br> world, for the world I belonged in has gone. I can't help you,<br> Scarlett, except by learning with as good grace as possible to be a<br> clumsy farmer. And that won't keep Tara for you. Don't you think<br> I realize the bitterness of our situation, living here on your<br> charity-- Oh, yes, Scarlett, your charity. I can never repay you<br> what you've done for me and for mine out of the kindness of your<br> heart. I realize it more acutely every day. And every day I see<br> more clearly how helpless I am to cope with what has come on us<br> all-- Every day my accursed shrinking from realities makes it<br> harder for me to face the new realities. Do you know what I mean?’<br><br> She nodded. She had no very clear idea what he meant but she clung<br> breathlessly on his words. This was the first time he had ever<br> spoken to her of the things he was thinking when he seemed so<br> remote from her. It excited her as if she were on the brink of a<br> discovery.<br><br> ‘It's a curse--this not wanting to look on naked realities. Until<br> the war, life was never more real to me than a shadow show on a<br> curtain. And I preferred it so. I do not like the outlines of<br> things to be too sharp. I like them gently blurred, a little<br> hazy.’<br><br> He stopped and smiled faintly, shivering a little as the cold wind<br> went through his thin shirt.<br><br> ‘In other words, Scarlett, I am a coward.’<br><br> His talk of shadow shows and hazy outlines conveyed no meaning to<br> her but his last words were in language she could understand. She<br> knew they were untrue. Cowardice was not in him. Every line of<br> his slender body spoke of generations of brave and gallant men and<br> Scarlett knew his war record by heart.<br><br> ‘Why, that's not so! Would a coward have climbed on the cannon at<br> Gettysburg and rallied the men? Would the General himself have<br> written Melanie a letter about a coward? And--’<br><br> ‘That's not courage,’ he said tiredly. ‘Fighting is like<br> champagne. It goes to the heads of cowards as quickly as of<br> heroes. Any fool can be brave on a battle field when it's be brave<br> or else be killed. I'm talking of something else. And my kind of<br> cowardice is infinitely worse than if I had run the first time I<br> heard a cannon fired.’<br><br> His words came slowly and with difficulty as if it hurt to speak<br> them and he seemed to stand off and look with a sad heart at what<br> he had said. Had any other man spoken so, Scarlett would have<br> dismissed such protestations contemptuously as mock modesty and a<br> bid for praise. But Ashley seemed to mean them and there was a<br> look in his eyes which eluded her--not fear, not apology, but the<br> bracing to a strain which was inevitable and overwhelming. The<br> wintry wind swept her damp ankles and she shivered again but her<br> shiver was less from the wind than from the dread his words evoked<br> in her heart.<br><br> ‘But, Ashley, what are you afraid of?’<br><br> ‘Oh, nameless things. Things which sound very silly when they are<br> put into words. Mostly of having life suddenly become too real, of<br> being brought into personal, too personal, contact with some of the<br> simple facts of life. It isn't that I mind splitting logs here in<br> the mud, but I do mind what it stands for. I do mind, very much,<br> the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved. Scarlett, before<br> the war, life was beautiful. There was a glamor to it, a<br> perfection and a completeness and a symmetry to it like Grecian<br> art. Maybe it wasn't so to everyone. I know that now. But to me,<br> living at Twelve Oaks, there was a real beauty to living. I<br> belonged in that life. I was a part of it. And now it is gone and<br> I am out of place in this new life, and I am afraid. Now, I know<br> that in the old days it was a shadow show I watched. I avoided<br> everything which was not shadowy, people and situations which were<br> too real, too vital. I resented their intrusion. I tried to avoid<br> you too, Scarlett. You were too full of living and too real and I<br> was cowardly enough to prefer shadows and dreams.’<br><br> ‘But--but--Melly?’<br><br> ‘Melanie is the gentlest of dreams and a part of my dreaming. And<br> if the war had not come I would have lived out my life, happily<br> buried at Twelve Oaks, contentedly watching life go by and never<br> being a part of it. But when the war came, life as it really is<br> thrust itself against me. The first time I went into action--it<br> was at Bull Run, you remember--I saw my boyhood friends blown to<br> bits and heard dying horses scream and learned the sickeningly<br> horrible feeling of seeing men crumple up and spit blood when I<br> shot them. But those weren't the worst things about the war,<br> Scarlett. The worst thing about the war was the people I had to<br> live with.<br><br> ‘I had sheltered myself from people all my life, I had carefully<br> selected my few friends. But the war taught me I had created a<br> world of my own with dream people in it. It taught me what people<br> really are, but it didn't teach me how to live with them. And I'm<br> afraid I'll never learn. Now, I know that in order to support my<br> wife and child, I will have to make my way among a world of people<br> with whom I have nothing in common. You, Scarlett, are taking life<br> by the horns and twisting it to your will. But where do I fit in<br> the world any more? I tell you I am afraid.’<br><br> While his low resonant voice went on, desolate, with a feeling she<br> could not understand, Scarlett clutched at words here and there,<br> trying to make sense of them. But the words swooped from her hands<br> like wild birds. Something was driving him, driving him with a<br> cruel goad, but she did not understand what it was.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, I don't know just when it was that the bleak realization<br> came over me that my own private shadow show was over. Perhaps in<br> the first five minutes at Bull Run when I saw the first man I<br> killed drop to the ground. But I knew it was over and I could no<br> longer be a spectator. No, I suddenly found myself on the curtain,<br> an actor, posturing and making futile gestures. My little inner<br> world was gone, invaded by people whose thoughts were not my<br> thoughts, whose actions were as alien as a Hottentot's. They'd<br> tramped through my world with slimy feet and there was no place<br> left where I could take refuge when things became too bad to stand.<br> When I was in prison, I thought: When the war is over, I can go<br> back to the old life and the old dreams and watch the shadow show<br> again. But, Scarlett, there's no going back. And this which is<br> facing all of us now is worse than war and worse than prison--and,<br> to me, worse than death. . . . So, you see, Scarlett, I'm being<br> punished for being afraid.’<br><br> ‘But, Ashley,’ she began, floundering in a quagmire of bewilderment,<br> ‘if you're afraid we'll starve, why--why-- Oh, Ashley, we'll manage<br> somehow! I know we will!’<br><br> For a moment, his eyes came back to her, wide and crystal gray, and<br> there was admiration in them. Then, suddenly, they were remote<br> again and she knew with a sinking heart that he had not been<br> thinking about starving. They were always like two people talking<br> to each other in different languages. But she loved him so much<br> that, when he withdrew as he had now done, it was like the warm sun<br> going down and leaving her in chilly twilight dews. She wanted to<br> catch him by the shoulders and hug him to her, make him realize<br> that she was flesh and blood and not something he had read or<br> dreamed. If she could only feel that sense of oneness with him for<br> which she had yearned since that day, so long ago, when he had come<br> home from Europe and stood on the steps of Tara and smiled up at<br> her.<br><br> ‘Starving's not pleasant,’ he said. ‘I know for I've starved, but<br> I'm not afraid of that. I am afraid of facing life without the<br> slow beauty of our old world that is gone.’<br><br> Scarlett thought despairingly that Melanie would know what he<br> meant. Melly and he were always talking such foolishness, poetry<br> and books and dreams and moonrays and star dust. He was not<br> fearing the things she feared, not the gnawing of an empty stomach,<br> nor the keenness of the winter wind nor eviction from Tara. He was<br> shrinking before some fear she had never known and could not<br> imagine. For, in God's name, what was there to fear in this wreck<br> of a world but hunger and cold and the loss of home?<br><br> And she had thought that if she listened closely she would know the<br> answer to Ashley.<br><br> ‘Oh!’ she said and the disappointment in her voice was that of a<br> child who opens a beautifully wrapped package to find it empty. At<br> her tone, he smiled ruefully as though apologizing.<br><br> ‘Forgive me, Scarlett, for talking so. I can't make you understand<br> because you don't know the meaning of fear. You have the heart of<br> a lion and an utter lack of imagination and I envy you both of<br> those qualities. You'll never mind facing realities and you'll<br> never want to escape from them as I do.’<br><br> ‘Escape!’<br><br> It was as if that were the only understandable word he had spoken.<br> Ashley, like her, was tired of the struggle and he wanted to<br> escape. Her breath came fast.<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley,’ she cried, ‘you're wrong. I do want to escape, too.<br> I am so very tired of it all!’<br><br> His eyebrows went up in disbelief and she laid a hand, feverish and<br> urgent, on his arm.<br><br> ‘Listen to me,’ she began swiftly, the words tumbling out one over<br> the other. ‘I'm tired of it all, I tell you. Bone tired and I'm<br> not going to stand it any longer. I've struggled for food and for<br> money and I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton and I've even<br> plowed until I can't stand it another minute. I tell you, Ashley,<br> the South is dead! It's dead! The Yankees and the free niggers<br> and the Carpetbaggers have got it and there's nothing left for us.<br> Ashley, let's run away!’<br><br> He peered at her sharply, lowering his head to look into her face,<br> now flaming with color.<br><br> ‘Yes, let's run away--leave them all! I'm tired of working for the<br> folks. Somebody will take care of them. There's always somebody<br> who takes care of people who can't take care of themselves. Oh,<br> Ashley, let's run away, you and I. We could go to Mexico--they<br> want officers in the Mexican Army and we could be so happy there.<br> I'd work for you, Ashley. I'd do anything for you. You know you<br> don't love Melanie--’<br><br> He started to speak, a stricken look on his face, but she stemmed<br> his words with a torrent of her own.<br><br> ‘You told me you loved me better than her that day--oh, you<br> remember that day! And I know you haven't changed! I can tell you<br> haven't changed! And you've just said she was nothing but a dream--<br> Oh, Ashley, let's go away! I could make you so happy. And<br> anyway,’ she added venomously, ‘Melanie can't-- Dr. Fontaine said<br> she couldn't ever have any more children and I could give you--’<br><br> His hands were on her shoulders so tightly that they hurt and she<br> stopped, breathless.<br><br> ‘We were to forget that day at Twelve Oaks.’<br><br> ‘Do you think I could ever forget it? Have you forgotten it? Can<br> you honestly say you don't love me?’<br><br> He drew a deep breath and answered quickly.<br><br> ‘No. I don't love you.’<br><br> ‘That's a lie.’<br><br> ‘Even if it is a lie,’ said Ashley and his voice was deadly quiet,<br> ‘it is not something which can be discussed.’<br><br> ‘You mean--’<br><br> ‘Do you think I could go off and leave Melanie and the baby, even<br> if I hated them both? Break Melanie's heart? Leave them both to<br> the charity of friends? Scarlett, are you mad? Isn't there any<br> sense of loyalty in you? You couldn't leave your father and the<br> girls. They're your responsibility, just as Melanie and Beau are<br> mine, and whether you are tired or not, they are here and you've<br> got to bear them.’<br><br> ‘I could leave them--I'm sick of them--tired of them--’<br><br> He leaned toward her and, for a moment, she thought with a catch at<br> her heart that he was going to take her in his arms. But instead,<br> he patted her arm and spoke as one comforting a child.<br><br> ‘I know you're sick and tired. That's why you are talking this<br> way. You've carried the load of three men. But I'm going to help<br> you--I won't always be so awkward--’<br><br> ‘There's only one way you can help me,’ she said dully, ‘and that's<br> to take me away from here and give us a new start somewhere, with a<br> chance for happiness. There's nothing to keep us here.’<br><br> ‘Nothing,’ he said quietly, ‘nothing--except honor.’<br><br> She looked at him with baffled longing and saw, as if for the first<br> time, how the crescents of his lashes were the thick rich gold of<br> ripe wheat, how proudly his head sat upon his bared neck and how<br> the look of race and dignity persisted in his slim erect body, even<br> through its grotesque rags. Her eyes met his, hers naked with<br> pleading, his remote as mountain lakes under gray skies.<br><br> She saw in them defeat of her wild dream, her mad desires.<br><br> Heartbreak and weariness sweeping over her, she dropped her head in<br> her hands and cried. He had never seen her cry. He had never<br> thought that women of her strong mettle had tears, and a flood of<br> tenderness and remorse swept him. He came to her swiftly and in a<br> moment had her in his arms, cradling her comfortingly, pressing her<br> black head to his heart, whispering: ‘Dear! My brave dear--don't!<br> You mustn't cry!’<br><br> At his touch, he felt her change within his grip and there was<br> madness and magic in the slim body he held and a hot soft glow in<br> the green eyes which looked up at him. Of a sudden, it was no<br> longer bleak winter. For Ashley, spring was back again, that half-<br> forgotten balmy spring of green rustlings and murmurings, a spring<br> of ease and indolence, careless days when the desires of youth were<br> warm in his body. The bitter years since then fell away and he saw<br> that the lips turned up to his were red and trembling and he kissed<br> her.<br><br> There was a curious low roaring sound in her ears as of sea shells<br> held against them and through the sound she dimly heard the swift<br> thudding of her heart. Her body seemed to melt into his and, for a<br> timeless time, they stood fused together as his lips took hers<br> hungrily as if he could never have enough.<br><br> When he suddenly released her she felt that she could not stand<br> alone and gripped the fence for support. She raised eyes blazing<br> with love and triumph to him.<br><br> ‘You do love me! You do love me! Say it--say it!’<br><br> His hands still rested on her shoulders and she felt them tremble<br> and loved their trembling. She leaned toward him ardently but he<br> held her away from him, looking at her with eyes from which all<br> remoteness had fled, eyes tormented with struggle and despair.<br><br> ‘Don't!’ he said. ‘Don't! If you do, I shall take you now, here.’<br><br> She smiled a bright hot smile which was forgetful of time or place<br> or anything but the memory of his mouth on hers.<br><br> Suddenly he shook her, shook her until her black hair tumbled down<br> about her shoulders, shook her as if in a mad rage at her--and at<br> himself.<br><br> ‘We won't do this!’ he said. ‘I tell you we won't do it!’<br><br> It seemed as if her neck would snap if he shook her again. She was<br> blinded by her hair and stunned by his action. She wrenched<br> herself away and stared at him. There were small beads of moisture<br> on his forehead and his fists were curled into claws as if in pain.<br> He looked at her directly, his gray eyes piercing.<br><br> ‘It's all my fault--none of yours and it will never happen again,<br> because I am going to take Melanie and the baby and go.’<br><br> ‘Go?’ she cried in anguish. ‘Oh, no!’<br><br> ‘Yes, by God! Do you think I'll stay here after this? When this<br> might happen again--’<br><br> ‘But, Ashley, you can't go. Why should you go? You love me--’<br><br> ‘You want me to say it? All right, I'll say it. I love you.’<br><br> He leaned over her with a sudden savagery which made her shrink<br> back against the fence.<br><br> ‘I love you, your courage and your stubbornness and your fire and<br> your utter ruthlessness. How much do I love you? So much that a<br> moment ago I would have outraged the hospitality of the house which<br> has sheltered me and my family, forgotten the best wife any man<br> ever had--enough to take you here in the mud like a--’<br><br> She struggled with a chaos of thoughts and there was a cold pain in<br> her heart as if an icicle had pierced it. She said haltingly: ‘If<br> you felt like that--and didn't take me--then you don't love me.’<br><br> ‘I can never make you understand.’<br><br> They fell silent and looked at each other. Suddenly Scarlett<br> shivered and saw, as if coming back from a long journey, that it<br> was winter and the fields were bare and harsh with stubble and she<br> was very cold. She saw too that the old aloof face of Ashley, the<br> one she knew so well, had come back and it was wintry too, and<br> harsh with hurt and remorse.<br><br> She would have turned and left him then, seeking the shelter of the<br> house to hide herself, but she was too tired to move. Even speech<br> was a labor and a weariness.<br><br> ‘There is nothing left,’ she said at last. ‘Nothing left for me.<br> Nothing to love. Nothing to fight for. You are gone and Tara is<br> going.’<br><br> He looked at her for a long space and then, leaning, scooped up a<br> small wad of red clay from the ground.<br><br> ‘Yes, there is something left,’ he said, and the ghost of his old<br> smile came back, the smile which mocked himself as well as her.<br> ‘Something you love better than me, though you may not know it.<br> You've still got Tara.’<br><br> He took her limp hand and pressed the damp clay into it and closed<br> her fingers about it. There was no fever in his hands now, nor in<br> hers. She looked at the red soil for a moment and it meant nothing<br> to her. She looked at him and realized dimly that there was an<br> integrity of spirit in him which was not to be torn apart by her<br> passionate hands, nor by any hands.<br><br> If it killed him, he would never leave Melanie. If he burned for<br> Scarlett until the end of his days, he would never take her and he<br> would fight to keep her at a distance. She would never again get<br> through that armor. The words, hospitality and loyalty and honor,<br> meant more to him than she did.<br><br> The clay was cold in her hand and she looked at it again.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I've still got this.’<br><br> At first, the words meant nothing and the clay was only red clay.<br> But unbidden came the thought of the sea of red dirt which<br> surrounded Tara and how very dear it was and how hard she had<br> fought to keep it--how hard she was going to have to fight if she<br> wished to keep it hereafter. She looked at him again and wondered<br> where the hot flood of feeling had gone. She could think but could<br> not feel, not about him nor Tara either, for she was drained of all<br> emotion.<br><br> ‘You need not go,’ she said clearly. ‘I won't have you all starve,<br> simply because I've thrown myself at your head. It will never<br> happen again.’<br><br> She turned away and started back toward the house across the rough<br> fields, twisting her hair into a knot upon her neck. Ashley<br> watched her go and saw her square her small thin shoulders as she<br> went. And that gesture went to his heart, more than any words she<br> had spoken.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXII<br><br> <br> She was still clutching the ball of red clay when she went up the<br> front steps. She had carefully avoided the back entrance, for<br> Mammy's sharp eyes would certainly have seen that something was<br> greatly amiss. Scarlett did not want to see Mammy or anyone else.<br> She did not feel that she could endure seeing anyone or talking to<br> anyone again. She had no feeling of shame or disappointment or<br> bitterness now, only a weakness of the knees and a great emptiness<br> of heart. She squeezed the clay so tightly it ran out from her<br> clenched fist and she said over and over, parrot-like: ‘I've still<br> got this. Yes, I've still got this.’<br><br> There was nothing else she did have, nothing but this red land,<br> this land she had been willing to throw away like a torn<br> handkerchief only a few minutes before. Now, it was dear to her<br> again and she wondered dully what madness had possessed her to hold<br> it so lightly. Had Ashley yielded, she could have gone away with<br> him and left family and friends without a backward look but, even<br> in her emptiness, she knew it would have torn her heart to leave<br> these dear red hills and long washed gullies and gaunt black pines.<br> Her thoughts would have turned back to them hungrily until the day<br> she died. Not even Ashley could have filled the empty spaces in<br> her heart where Tara had been uprooted. How wise Ashley was and<br> how well he knew her! He had only to press the damp earth into her<br> hand to bring her to her senses.<br><br> She was in the hall preparing to close the door when she heard the<br> sound of horse's hooves and turned to look down the driveway. To<br> have visitors at this of all times was too much. She'd hurry to<br> her room and plead a headache.<br><br> But when the carriage came nearer, her flight was checked by her<br> amazement. It was a new carriage, shiny with varnish, and the<br> harness was new too, with bits of polished brass here and there.<br> Strangers, certainly. No one she knew had the money for such a<br> grand new turn-out as this.<br><br> She stood in the doorway watching, the cold draft blowing her<br> skirts about her damp ankles. Then the carriage stopped in front<br> of the house and Jonas Wilkerson alighted. Scarlett was so<br> surprised at the sight of their former overseer driving so fine a<br> rig and in so splendid a greatcoat she could not for a moment<br> believe her eyes. Will had told her he looked quite prosperous<br> since he got his new job with the Freedmen's Bureau. Made a lot of<br> money, Will said, swindling the niggers or the government, one or<br> tuther, or confiscating folks' cotton and swearing it was<br> Confederate government cotton. Certainly he never came by all that<br> money honestly in these hard times.<br><br> And here he was now, stepping out of an elegant carriage and<br> handing down a woman dressed within an inch of her life. Scarlett<br> saw in a glance that the dress was bright in color to the point of<br> vulgarity but nevertheless her eyes went over the outfit hungrily.<br> It had been so long since she had even seen stylish new clothes.<br> Well! So hoops aren't so wide this year, she thought, scanning the<br> red plaid gown. And, as she took in the black velvet paletot, how<br> short jackets are! And what a cunning hat! Bonnets must be out of<br> style, for this hat was only an absurd flat red velvet affair,<br> perched on the top of the woman's head like a stiffened pancake.<br> The ribbons did not tie under the chin as bonnet ribbons tied but<br> in the back under the massive bunch of curls which fell from the<br> rear of the hat, curls which Scarlett could not help noticing did<br> not match the woman's hair in either color or texture.<br><br> As the woman stepped to the ground and looked toward the house,<br> Scarlett saw there was something familiar about the rabbity face,<br> caked with white powder.<br><br> ‘Why, it's Emmie Slattery!’ she cried, so surprised she spoke the<br> words aloud.<br><br> ‘Yes'm, it's me,’ said Emmie, tossing her head with an ingratiating<br> smile and starting toward the steps.<br><br> Emmie Slattery! The dirty tow-headed slut whose illegitimate baby<br> Ellen had baptized, Emmie who had given typhoid to Ellen and killed<br> her. This overdressed, common, nasty piece of poor white trash was<br> coming up the steps of Tara, bridling and grinning as if she<br> belonged here. Scarlett thought of Ellen and, in a rush, feeling<br> came back into the emptiness of her mind, a murderous rage so<br> strong it shook her like the ague.<br><br> ‘Get off those steps, you trashy wench!’ she cried. ‘Get off this<br> land! Get out!’<br><br> Emmie's jaw sagged suddenly and she glanced at Jonas who came up<br> with lowering brows. He made an effort at dignity, despite his<br> anger.<br><br> ‘You must not speak that way to my wife,’ he said.<br><br> ‘Wife?’ said Scarlett and burst into a laugh that was cutting with<br> contempt. ‘High time you made her your wife. Who baptized your<br> other brats after you killed my mother?’<br><br> Emmie said ‘Oh!’ and retreated hastily down the steps but Jonas<br> stopped her flight toward the carriage with a rough grip on her<br> arm.<br><br> ‘We came out here to pay a call--a friendly call,’ he snarled.<br> ‘And talk a little business with old friends--’<br><br> ‘Friends?’ Scarlett's voice was like a whiplash. ‘When were we<br> ever friends with the like of you? The Slatterys lived on our<br> charity and paid it back by killing Mother--and you--you-- Pa<br> discharged you about Emmie's brat and you know it. Friends? Get<br> off this place before I call Mr. Benteen and Mr. Wilkes.’<br><br> Under the words, Emmie broke her husband's hold and fled for the<br> carriage, scrambling in with a flash of patent-leather boots with<br> bright-red tops and red tassels.<br><br> Now Jonas shook with a fury equal to Scarlett's and his sallow face<br> was as red as an angry turkey gobbler's.<br><br> ‘Still high and mighty, aren't you? Well, I know all about you. I<br> know you haven't got shoes for your feet. I know your father's<br> turned idiot--’<br><br> ‘Get off this place!’<br><br> ‘Oh, you won't sing that way very long. I know you're broke. I<br> know you can't even pay your taxes. I came out here to offer to<br> buy this place from you--to make you a right good offer. Emmie had<br> a hankering to live here. But, by God, I won't give you a cent<br> now! You highflying, bog-trotting Irish will find out who's<br> running things around here when you get sold out for taxes. And<br> I'll buy this place, lock, stock and barrel--furniture and all--and<br> I'll live in it.’<br><br> So it was Jonas Wilkerson who wanted Tara--Jonas and Emmie, who in<br> some twisted way thought to even past slights by living in the home<br> where they had been slighted. All her nerves hummed with hate, as<br> they had hummed that day when she shoved the pistol barrel into the<br> Yankee's bearded face and fired. She wished she had that pistol<br> now.<br><br> ‘I'll tear this house down, stone by stone, and burn it and sow<br> every acre with salt before I see either of you put foot over this<br> threshold,’ she shouted. ‘Get out, I tell you! Get out!’<br><br> Jonas glared at her, started to say more and then walked toward the<br> carriage. He climbed in beside his whimpering wife and turned the<br> horse. As they drove off, Scarlett had the impulse to spit at<br> them. She did spit. She knew it was a common, childish gesture<br> but it made her feel better. She wished she had done it while they<br> could see her.<br><br> Those damned nigger lovers daring to come here and taunt her about<br> her poverty! That hound never intended offering her a price for<br> Tara. He just used that as an excuse to come and flaunt himself<br> and Emmie in her face. The dirty Scallawags, the lousy trashy poor<br> whites, boasting they would live at Tara!<br><br> Then, sudden terror struck her and her rage melted. God's<br> nightgown! They will come and live here! There was nothing she<br> could do to keep them from buying Tara, nothing to keep them from<br> levying on every mirror and table and bed, on Ellen's shining<br> mahogany and rosewood, and every bit of it precious to her, scarred<br> though it was by the Yankee raiders. And the Robillard silver too.<br> I won't let them do it, thought Scarlett vehemently. No, not if<br> I've got to burn the place down! Emmie Slattery will never set her<br> foot on a single bit of flooring Mother ever walked on!<br><br> She closed the door and leaned against it and she was very<br> frightened. More frightened even than she had been that day when<br> Sherman's army was in the house. That day the worst she could fear<br> was that Tara would be burned over her head. But this was worse--<br> these low common creatures living in this house, bragging to their<br> low common friends how they had turned the proud O'Haras out.<br> Perhaps they'd even bring negroes here to dine and sleep. Will had<br> told her Jonas made a great to-do about being equal with the<br> negroes, ate with them, visited in their houses, rode them around<br> with him in his carriage, put his arms around their shoulders.<br><br> When she thought of the possibility of this final insult to Tara,<br> her heart pounded so hard she could scarcely breathe. She was<br> trying to get her mind on her problem, trying to figure some way<br> out, but each time she collected her thoughts, fresh gusts of rage<br> and fear shook her. There must be some way out, there must be<br> someone somewhere who had money she could borrow. Money couldn't<br> just dry up and blow away. Somebody had to have money. Then the<br> laughing words of Ashley came back to her:<br><br> ‘Only one person, Rhett Butler . . . who has money.’<br><br> Rhett Butler. She walked quickly into the parlor and shut the door<br> behind her. The dim gloom of drawn blinds and winter twilight<br> closed about her. No one would think of hunting for her here and<br> she wanted time to think, undisturbed. The idea which had just<br> occurred to her was so simple she wondered why she had not thought<br> of it before.<br><br> ‘I'll get the money from Rhett. I'll sell him the diamond earbobs.<br> Or I'll borrow the money from him and let him keep the earbobs till<br> I can pay him back.’<br><br> For a moment, relief was so great she felt weak. She would pay the<br> taxes and laugh in Jonas Wilkerson's face. But close on this happy<br> thought came relentless knowledge.<br><br> ‘It's not only for this year that I'll need tax money. There's<br> next year and all the years of my life. If I pay up this time,<br> they'll raise the taxes higher next time till they drive me out.<br> If I make a good cotton crop, they'll tax it till I'll get nothing<br> for it or maybe confiscate it outright and say it's Confederate<br> cotton. The Yankees and the scoundrels teamed up with them have<br> got me where they want me. All my life, as long as I live, I'll be<br> afraid they'll get me somehow. All my life I'll be scared and<br> scrambling for money and working myself to death, only to see my<br> work go for nothing and my cotton stolen. . . . Just borrowing<br> three hundred dollars for the taxes will be only a stopgap. What I<br> want is to get out of this fix, for good--so I can go to sleep at<br> night without worrying over what's going to happen to me tomorrow,<br> and next month, and next year.’<br><br> Her mind ticked on steadily. Coldly and logically an idea grew in<br> her brain. She thought of Rhett, a flash of white teeth against<br> swarthy skin, sardonic black eyes caressing her. She recalled the<br> hot night in Atlanta, close to the end of the siege, when he sat on<br> Aunt Pitty's porch half hidden in the summer darkness, and she felt<br> again the heat of his hand upon her arm as he said: ‘I want you<br> more than I have ever wanted any woman--and I've waited longer for<br> you than I've ever waited for any woman.’<br><br> ‘I'll marry him,’ she thought coolly. ‘And then I'll never have to<br> bother about money again.’<br><br> Oh, blessed thought, sweeter than hope of Heaven, never to worry<br> about money again, to know that Tara was safe, that the family was<br> fed and clothed, that she would never again have to bruise herself<br> against stone walls!<br><br> She felt very old. The afternoon's events had drained her of all<br> feeling, first the startling news about the taxes, then Ashley and,<br> last, her murderous rage at Jonas Wilkerson. No, there was no<br> emotion left in her. If all her capacity to feel had not been<br> utterly exhausted, something in her would have protested against<br> the plan taking form in her mind, for she hated Rhett as she hated<br> no other person in all the world. But she could not feel. She<br> could only think and her thoughts were very practical.<br><br> ‘I said some terrible things to him that night when he deserted us<br> on the road, but I can make him forget them,’ she thought<br> contemptuously, still sure of her power to charm. ‘Butter won't<br> melt in my mouth when I'm around him. I'll make him think I always<br> loved him and was just upset and frightened that night. Oh, men<br> are so conceited they'll believe anything that flatters them. . . .<br> I must never let him dream what straits we're in, not till I've got<br> him. Oh, he mustn't know! If he even suspected how poor we are,<br> he'd know it was his money I wanted and not himself. After all,<br> there's no way he could know, for even Aunt Pitty doesn't know the<br> worst. And after I've married him, he'll have to help us. He<br> can't let his wife's people starve.’<br><br> His wife. Mrs. Rhett Butler. Something of repulsion, buried deep<br> beneath her cold thinking, stirred faintly and then was stilled.<br> She remembered the embarrassing and disgusting events of her brief<br> honeymoon with Charles, his fumbling hands, his awkwardness, his<br> incomprehensible emotions--and Wade Hampton.<br><br> ‘I won't think about it now. I'll bother about it after I've<br> married him. . . .’<br><br> After she had married him. Memory rang a bell. A chill went down<br> her spine. She remembered again that night on Aunt Pitty's porch,<br> remembered how she asked him if he was proposing to her, remembered<br> how hatefully he had laughed and said: ‘My dear, I'm not a<br> marrying man.’<br><br> Suppose he was still not a marrying man. Suppose despite all her<br> charms and wiles, he refused to marry her. Suppose--oh, terrible<br> thought!--suppose he had completely forgotten about her and was<br> chasing after some other woman.<br><br> ‘I want you more than I have ever wanted any woman. . . .’<br><br> Scarlett's nails dug into her palms as she clenched her fists. ‘If<br> he's forgotten me, I'll make him remember me. I'll make him want<br> me again.’<br><br> And, if he would not marry her but still wanted her, there was a<br> way to get the money. After all, he had once asked her to be his<br> mistress.<br><br> In the dim grayness of the parlor she fought a quick decisive<br> battle with the three most binding ties of her soul--the memory of<br> Ellen, the teachings of her religion and her love for Ashley. She<br> knew that what she had in her mind must be hideous to her mother<br> even in that warm far-off Heaven where she surely was. She knew<br> that fornication was a mortal sin. And she knew that, loving<br> Ashley as she did, her plan was doubly prostitution.<br><br> But all these things went down before the merciless coldness of her<br> mind and the goad of desperation. Ellen was dead and perhaps death<br> gave an understanding of all things. Religion forbade fornication<br> on pain of hell fire but if the Church thought she was going to<br> leave one stone unturned in saving Tara and saving the family from<br> starving--well, let the Church bother about that. She wouldn't.<br> At least, not now. And Ashley--Ashley didn't want her. Yes, he<br> did want her. The memory of his warm mouth on hers told her that.<br> But he would never take her away with him. Strange that going away<br> with Ashley did not seem like a sin, but with Rhett--<br><br> In the dull twilight of the winter afternoon she came to the end of<br> the long road which had begun the night Atlanta fell. She had set<br> her feet upon that road a spoiled, selfish and untried girl, full<br> of youth, warm of emotion, easily bewildered by life. Now, at the<br> end of the road, there was nothing left of that girl. Hunger and<br> hard labor, fear and constant strain, the terrors of war and the<br> terrors of Reconstruction had taken away all warmth and youth and<br> softness. About the core of her being, a shell of hardness had<br> formed and, little by little, layer by layer, the shell had<br> thickened during the endless months.<br><br> But until this very day, two hopes had been left to sustain her.<br> She had hoped that the war being over, life would gradually resume<br> its old face. She had hoped that Ashley's return would bring back<br> some meaning into life. Now both hopes were gone. The sight of<br> Jonas Wilkerson in the front walk of Tara had made her realize that<br> for her, for the whole South, the war would never end. The<br> bitterest fighting, the most brutal retaliations, were just<br> beginning. And Ashley was imprisoned forever by words which were<br> stronger than any jail.<br><br> Peace had failed her and Ashley had failed her, both in the same<br> day, and it was as if the last crevice in the shell had been<br> sealed, the final layer hardened. She had become what Grandma<br> Fontaine had counseled against, a woman who had seen the worst and<br> so had nothing else to fear. Not life nor Mother nor loss of love<br> nor public opinion. Only hunger and her nightmare dream of hunger<br> could make her afraid.<br><br> A curious sense of lightness, of freedom, pervaded her now that she<br> had finally hardened her heart against all that bound her to the<br> old days and the old Scarlett. She had made her decision and,<br> thank God, she wasn't afraid. She had nothing to lose and her mind<br> was made up.<br><br> If she could only coax Rhett into marrying her, all would be<br> perfect. But if she couldn't--well she'd get the money just the<br> same. For a brief moment she wondered with impersonal curiosity<br> what would be expected of a mistress. Would Rhett insist on<br> keeping her in Atlanta as people said he kept the Watling woman?<br> If he made her stay in Atlanta, he'd have to pay well--pay enough<br> to balance what her absence from Tara would be worth. Scarlett was<br> very ignorant of the hidden side of men's lives and had no way of<br> knowing just what the arrangement might involve. And she wondered<br> if she would have a baby. That would be distinctly terrible.<br><br> ‘I won't think of that now. I'll think of it later,’ and she<br> pushed the unwelcome idea into the back of her mind lest it shake<br> her resolution. She'd tell the family tonight she was going to<br> Atlanta to borrow money, to try to mortgage the farm if necessary.<br> That would be all they needed to know until such an evil day when<br> they might find out differently.<br><br> With the thought of action, her head went up and her shoulders went<br> back. This affair was not going to be easy, she knew. Formerly,<br> it had been Rhett who asked for her favors and she who held the<br> power. Now she was the beggar and a beggar in no position to<br> dictate terms.<br><br> ‘But I won't go to him like a beggar. I'll go like a queen<br> granting favors. He'll never know.’<br><br> She walked to the long pier glass and looked at herself, her head<br> held high. And she saw framed in the cracking gilt molding a<br> stranger. It was as if she were really seeing herself for the<br> first time in a year. She had glanced in the mirror every morning<br> to see that her face was clean and her hair tidy but she had always<br> been too pressed by other things to really see herself. But this<br> stranger! Surely this thin hollow-cheeked woman couldn't be<br> Scarlett O'Hara! Scarlett O'Hara had a pretty, coquettish, high-<br> spirited face. This face at which she stared was not pretty at all<br> and had none of the charm she remembered so well. It was white and<br> strained and the black brows above slanting green eyes swooped up<br> startlingly against the white skin like frightened bird's wings.<br> There was a hard and hunted look about this face.<br><br> ‘I'm not pretty enough to get him!’ she thought and desperation<br> came back to her. ‘I'm thin--oh, I'm terribly thin!’<br><br> She patted her cheeks, felt frantically at her collar bones,<br> feeling them stand out through her basque. And her breasts were so<br> small, almost as small as Melanie's. She'd have to put ruffles in<br> her bosom to make them look larger and she had always had contempt<br> for girls who resorted to such subterfuges. Ruffles! That brought<br> up another thought. Her clothes. She looked down at her dress,<br> spreading its mended folds wide between her hands. Rhett liked<br> women who were well dressed, fashionably dressed. She remembered<br> with longing the flounced green dress she had worn when she first<br> came out of mourning, the dress she wore with the green plumed<br> bonnet he had brought her and she recalled the approving<br> compliments he had paid her. She remembered, too, with hate<br> sharpened by envy the red plaid dress, the red-topped boots with<br> tassels and the pancake hat of Emmie Slattery. They were gaudy but<br> they were new and fashionable and certainly they caught the eye.<br> And, oh, how she wanted to catch the eye! Especially the eye of<br> Rhett Butler! If he should see her in her old clothes, he'd know<br> everything was wrong at Tara. And he must not know.<br><br> What a fool she had been to think she could go to Atlanta and have<br> him for the asking, she with her scrawny neck and hungry cat eyes<br> and raggedy dress! If she hadn't been able to pry a proposal from<br> him at the height of her beauty, when she had her prettiest<br> clothes, how could she expect to get one now when she was ugly and<br> dressed tackily? If Miss Pitty's story was true, he must have more<br> money than anyone in Atlanta and probably had his pick of all the<br> pretty ladies, good and bad. Well, she thought grimly, I've got<br> something that most pretty ladies haven't got--and that's a mind<br> that's made up. And if I had just one nice dress--<br><br> There wasn't a nice dress in Tara or a dress which hadn't been<br> turned twice and mended.<br><br> ‘That's that,’ she thought, disconsolately looking down at the<br> floor. She saw Ellen's moss-green velvet carpet, now worn and<br> scuffed and torn and spotted from the numberless men who had slept<br> upon it, and the sight depressed her more, for it made her realize<br> that Tara was just as ragged as she. The whole darkening room<br> depressed her and, going to the window, she raised the sash,<br> unlatched the shutters and let the last light of the wintry sunset<br> into the room. She closed the window and leaned her head against<br> the velvet curtains and looked out across the bleak pasture toward<br> the dark cedars of the burying ground.<br><br> The moss-green velvet curtains felt prickly and soft beneath her<br> cheek and she rubbed her face against them gratefully, like a cat.<br> And then suddenly she looked at them.<br><br> A minute later, she was dragging a heavy marble-topped table across<br> the floor. Its rusty castors screeching in protest. She rolled<br> the table under the window, gathered up her skirts, climbed on it<br> and tiptoed to reach the heavy curtain pole. It was almost out of<br> her reach and she jerked at it so impatiently the nails came out of<br> the wood, and the curtains, pole and all, fell to the floor with a<br> clatter.<br><br> As if by magic, the door of the parlor opened and the wide black<br> face of Mammy appeared, ardent curiosity and deepest suspicion<br> evident in every wrinkle. She looked disapprovingly at Scarlett,<br> poised on the table top, her skirts above her knees, ready to leap<br> to the floor. There was a look of excitement and triumph on her<br> face which brought sudden distrust to Mammy.<br><br> ‘Whut you up to wid Miss Ellen's po'teers?’ she demanded.<br><br> ‘What are you up to listening outside doors?’ asked Scarlett,<br> leaping nimbly to the floor and gathering up a length of the heavy<br> dusty velvet.<br><br> ‘Dat ain' needer hyah no dar,’ countered Mammy, girding herself for<br> combat. ‘You ain' got no bizness wid Miss Ellen's po'teers,<br> juckin' de poles plum outer de wood, an' drappin' dem on de flo' in<br> de dust. Miss Ellen set gret sto' by dem po'teers an' Ah ain'<br> 'tendin' ter have you muss dem up dat way.’<br><br> Scarlett turned green eyes on Mammy, eyes which were feverishly<br> gay, eyes which looked like the bad little girl of the good old<br> days Mammy sighed about.<br><br> ‘Scoot up to the attic and get my box of dress patterns, Mammy,’<br> she cried, giving her a slight shove. ‘I'm going to have a new<br> dress.’<br><br> Mammy was torn between indignation at the very idea of her two<br> hundred pounds scooting anywhere, much less to the attic, and the<br> dawning of a horrid suspicion. Quickly she snatched the curtain<br> lengths from Scarlett, holding them against her monumental, sagging<br> breasts as if they were holy relics.<br><br> ‘Not outer Miss Ellen's po'teers is you gwine have a new dress, ef<br> dat's whut you figgerin' on. Not w'ile Ah got breaf in mah body.’<br><br> For a moment the expression Mammy was wont to describe to herself<br> as ‘bullheaded’ flitted over her young mistress' face and then it<br> passed into a smile, so difficult for Mammy to resist. But it did<br> not fool the old woman. She knew Miss Scarlett was employing that<br> smile merely to get around her and in this matter she was<br> determined not to be gotten around.<br><br> ‘Mammy, don't be mean. I'm going to Atlanta to borrow some money<br> and I've got to have a new dress.’<br><br> ‘You doan need no new dress. Ain' no other ladies got new dresses.<br> Dey weahs dey ole ones an' dey weahs dem proudfully. Ain' no<br> reason why Miss Ellen's chile kain weah rags ef she wants ter, an'<br> eve'ybody respec' her lak she wo' silk.’<br><br> The bullheaded expression began to creep back. Lordy, 'twus right<br> funny how de older Miss Scarlett git de mo' she look lak Mist'<br> Gerald and de less lak Miss Ellen!<br><br> ‘Now, Mammy you know Aunt Pitty wrote us that Miss Fanny Elsing is<br> getting married this Saturday, and of course I'll go to the<br> wedding. And I'll need a new dress to wear.’<br><br> ‘De dress you got on'll be jes' as nice as Miss Fanny's weddin'<br> dress. Miss Pitty done wrote dat de Elsings mighty po'.’<br><br> ‘But I've got to have a new dress! Mammy, you don't know how we<br> need money. The taxes--’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, Ah knows all 'bout de taxes but--’<br><br> ‘You do?’<br><br> ‘Well'm, Gawd give me ears, din' he, an' ter hear wid? Specially<br> w'en Mist' Will doan never tek trouble ter close de do'.’<br><br> Was there nothing Mammy did not overhear? Scarlett wondered how<br> that ponderous body which shook the floors could move with such<br> savage stealth when its owner wished to eavesdrop.<br><br> ‘Well, if you heard all that, I suppose you heard Jonas Wilkerson<br> and that Emmie--’<br><br> ‘Yas'm,’ said Mammy with smoldering eyes.<br><br> ‘Well, don't be a mule, Mammy. Don't you see I've got to go to<br> Atlanta and get money for the taxes? I've got to get some money.<br> I've got to do it!’ She hammered one small fist into the other.<br> ‘Name of God, Mammy, they'll turn us all out into the road and then<br> where'll we go? Are you going to argue with me about a little<br> matter of Mother's curtains when that trash Emmie Slattery who<br> killed Mother is fixing to move into this house and sleep in the<br> bed Mother slept in?’<br><br> Mammy shifted from one foot to another like a restive elephant.<br> She had a dim feeling that she was being got around.<br><br> ‘No'm, Ah ain' wantin' ter see trash in Miss Ellen's house or us<br> all in de road but--’ She fixed Scarlett with a suddenly accusing<br> eye: ‘Who is you fixin' ter git money frum dat you needs a new<br> dress?’<br><br> ‘That,’ said Scarlett, taken aback, ‘is my own business.’<br><br> Mammy looked at her piercingly, just as she had done when Scarlett<br> was small and had tried unsuccessfully to palm off plausible<br> excuses for misdeeds. She seemed to be reading her mind and<br> Scarlett dropped her eyes unwillingly, the first feeling of guilt<br> at her intended conduct creeping over her.<br><br> ‘So you needs a spang new pretty dress ter borry money wid. Dat<br> doan lissen jes' right ter me. An' you ain' sayin' whar de money<br> ter come frum.’<br><br> ‘I'm not saying anything,’ said Scarlett indignantly. ‘It's my own<br> business. Are you going to give me that curtain and help me make<br> the dress?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm,’ said Mammy softly, capitulating with a suddenness which<br> aroused all the suspicion in Scarlett's mind. ‘Ah gwine he'p you<br> mek it an' Ah specs we mout git a petticoat outer de satin linin'<br> of de po'teers an' trim a pa'r pantalets wid de lace cuttins.’<br><br> She handed the velvet curtain back to Scarlett and a sly smile<br> spread over her face.<br><br> ‘Miss Melly gwine ter 'Lanta wid you, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Scarlett sharply, beginning to realize what was coming.<br> ‘I'm going by myself.’<br><br> ‘Dat's whut you thinks,’ said Mammy firmly, ‘but Ah is gwine wid<br> you an' dat new dress. Yas, Ma'm, eve'y step of de way.’<br><br> For an instant Scarlett envisaged her trip to Atlanta and her<br> conversation with Rhett with Mammy glowering chaperonage like a<br> large black Cerberus in the background. She smiled again and put a<br> hand on Mammy's arm.<br><br> ‘Mammy darling, you're sweet to want to go with me and help me, but<br> how on earth would the folks here get on without you? You know you<br> just about run Tara.’<br><br> ‘Huh!’ said Mammy. ‘Doan do no good ter sweet talk me, Miss<br> Scarlett. Ah been knowin' you sence Ah put de fust pa'r of diapers<br> on you. Ah's said Ah's gwine ter 'Lanta wid you an' gwine Ah is.<br> Miss Ellen be tuhnin' in her grabe at you gwine up dar by yo'seff<br> wid dat town full up wid Yankees an' free niggers an' sech like.’<br><br> ‘But I'll be at Aunt Pittypat's,’ Scarlett offered frantically.<br><br> ‘Miss Pittypat a fine woman an' she think she see eve'ything but<br> she doan,’ said Mammy, and turning with the majestic air of having<br> closed the interview, she went into the hall. The boards trembled<br> as she called:<br><br> ‘Prissy, child! Fly up de stairs an' fotch Miss Scarlett's pattun<br> box frum de attic an' try an' fine de scissors without takin' all<br> night 'bout it.’<br><br> ‘This is a fine mess,’ thought Scarlett dejectedly. ‘I'd as soon<br> have a bloodhound after me.’<br><br> After supper had been cleared away, Scarlett and Mammy spread<br> patterns on the dining-room table while Suellen and Carreen busily<br> ripped satin linings from curtains and Melanie brushed the velvet<br> with a clean hairbrush to remove the dust. Gerald, Will and Ashley<br> sat about the room smoking, smiling at the feminine tumult. A<br> feeling of pleasurable excitement which seemed to emanate from<br> Scarlett was on them all, an excitement they could not understand.<br> There was color in Scarlett's face and a bright hard glitter in her<br> eyes and she laughed a good deal. Her laughter pleased them all,<br> for it had been months since they had heard her really laugh.<br> Especially did it please Gerald. His eyes were less vague than<br> usual as they followed her swishing figure about the room and he<br> patted her approvingly whenever she was within reach. The girls<br> were as excited as if preparing for a ball and they ripped and cut<br> and basted as if making a ball dress of their own.<br><br> Scarlett was going to Atlanta to borrow money or to mortgage Tara<br> if necessary. But what was a mortgage, after all? Scarlett said<br> they could easily pay it off out of next year's cotton and have<br> money left over, and she said it with such finality they did not<br> think to question. And when they asked who was going to lend the<br> money she said: ‘Layovers catch meddlers,’ so archly they all<br> laughed and teased her about her millionaire friend.<br><br> ‘It must be Captain Rhett Butler,’ said Melanie slyly and they<br> exploded with mirth at this absurdity, knowing how Scarlett hated<br> him and never failed to refer to him as ‘that skunk, Rhett Butler.’<br><br> But Scarlett did not laugh at this and Ashley, who had laughed,<br> stopped abruptly as he saw Mammy shoot a quick, guarded glance at<br> Scarlett.<br><br> Suellen, moved to generosity by the party spirit of the occasion,<br> produced her Irish-lace collar, somewhat worn but still pretty, and<br> Carreen insisted that Scarlett wear her slippers to Atlanta, for<br> they were in better condition than any others at Tara. Melanie<br> begged Mammy to leave her enough velvet scraps to recover the frame<br> of her battered bonnet and brought shouts of laughter when she said<br> the old rooster was going to part with his gorgeous bronze and<br> green-black tail feathers unless he took to the swamp immediately.<br><br> Scarlett, watching the flying fingers, heard the laughter and<br> looked at them all with concealed bitterness and contempt.<br><br> ‘They haven't an idea what is really happening to me or to<br> themselves or to the South. They still think, in spite of<br> everything, that nothing really dreadful can happen to any of them<br> because they are who they are, O'Haras, Wilkeses, Hamiltons. Even<br> the darkies feel that way. Oh, they're all fools! They'll never<br> realize! They'll go right on thinking and living as they always<br> have, and nothing will change them. Melly can dress in rags and<br> pick cotton and even help me murder a man but it doesn't change<br> her. She's still the shy well-bred Mrs. Wilkes, the perfect lady!<br> And Ashley can see death and war and be wounded and lie in jail and<br> come home to less than nothing and still be the same gentleman he<br> was when he had all Twelve Oaks behind him. Will is different. He<br> knows how things really are but then Will never had anything much<br> to lose. And as for Suellen and Carreen--they think all this is<br> just a temporary matter. They don't change to meet changed<br> conditions because they think it'll all be over soon. They think<br> God is going to work a miracle especially for their benefit. But<br> He won't. The only miracle that's going to be worked around here<br> is the one I'm going to work on Rhett Butler. . . . They won't<br> change. Maybe they can't change. I'm the only one who's changed--<br> and I wouldn't have changed if I could have helped it.’<br><br> Mammy finally turned the men out of the dining room and closed the<br> door, so the fitting could begin. Pork helped Gerald upstairs to<br> bed and Ashley and Will were left alone in the lamplight in the<br> front hall. They were silent for a while and Will chewed his<br> tobacco like a placid ruminant animal. But his mild face was far<br> from placid.<br><br> ‘This goin' to Atlanta,’ he said at last in a slow voice, ‘I don't<br> like it. Not one bit.’<br><br> Ashley looked at Will quickly and then looked away, saying nothing<br> but wondering if Will had the same awful suspicion which was<br> haunting him. But that was impossible. Will didn't know what had<br> taken place in the orchard that afternoon and how it had driven<br> Scarlett to desperation. Will couldn't have noticed Mammy's face<br> when Rhett Butler's name was mentioned and, besides, Will didn't<br> know about Rhett's money or his foul reputation. At least, Ashley<br> did not think he could know these things, but since coming back to<br> Tara he had realized that Will, like Mammy, seemed to know things<br> without being told, to sense them before they happened. There was<br> something ominous in the air, exactly what Ashley did not know, but<br> he was powerless to save Scarlett from it. She had not met his<br> eyes once that evening and the hard bright gaiety with which she<br> had treated him was frightening. The suspicions which tore at him<br> were too terrible to be put into words. He did not have the right<br> to insult her by asking her if they were true. He clenched his<br> fists. He had no rights at all where she was concerned; this<br> afternoon he had forfeited them all, forever. He could not help<br> her. No one could help her. But when he thought of Mammy and the<br> look of grim determination she wore as she cut into the velvet<br> curtains, he was cheered a little. Mammy would take care of<br> Scarlett whether Scarlett wished it or not.<br><br> ‘I have caused all this,’ he thought despairingly. ‘I have driven<br> her to this.’<br><br> He remembered the way she had squared her shoulders when she turned<br> away from him that afternoon, remembered the stubborn lift of her<br> head. His heart went out to her, torn with his own helplessness,<br> wrenched with admiration. He knew she had no such word in her<br> vocabulary as gallantry, knew she would have stared blankly if he<br> had told her she was the most gallant soul he had ever known. He<br> knew she would not understand how many truly fine things he<br> ascribed to her when he thought of her as gallant. He knew that<br> she took life as it came, opposed her tough-fibered mind to<br> whatever obstacles there might be, fought on with a determination<br> that would not recognize defeat, and kept on fighting even when she<br> saw defeat was inevitable.<br><br> But, for four years, he had seen others who had refused to<br> recognize defeat, men who rode gaily into sure disaster because<br> they were gallant. And they had been defeated, just the same.<br><br> He thought as he stared at Will in the shadowy hall that he had<br> never known such gallantry as the gallantry of Scarlett O'Hara<br> going forth to conquer the world in her mother's velvet curtains<br> and the tail feathers of a rooster.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXIII<br><br> <br> A cold wind was blowing stiffly and the scudding clouds overhead<br> were the deep gray of slate when Scarlett and Mammy stepped from<br> the train in Atlanta the next afternoon. The depot had not been<br> rebuilt since the burning of the city and they alighted amid<br> cinders and mud a few yards above the blackened ruins which marked<br> the site. Habit strong upon her, Scarlett looked about for Uncle<br> Peter and Pitty's carriage, for she had always been met by them<br> when returning from Tara to Atlanta during the war years. Then she<br> caught herself with a sniff at her own absent-mindedness.<br> Naturally, Peter wasn't there for she had given Aunt Pitty no<br> warning of her coming and, moreover, she remembered that one of the<br> old lady's letters had dealt tearfully with the death of the old<br> nag Peter had ‘'quired’ in Macon to bring her back to Atlanta after<br> the surrender.<br><br> She looked about the rutted and cut-up space around the depot for<br> the equipage of some old friend or acquaintance who might drive<br> them to Aunt Pitty's house but she recognized no one, black or<br> white. Probably none of her old friends owned carriages now, if<br> what Pitty had written them was true. Times were so hard it was<br> difficult to feed and lodge humans, much less animals. Most of<br> Pitty's friends, like herself, were afoot these days.<br><br> There were a few wagons loading at the freight cars and several<br> mud-splashed buggies with rough-looking strangers at the reins but<br> only two carriages. One was a closed carriage, the other open and<br> occupied by a well-dressed woman and a Yankee officer. Scarlett<br> drew in her breath sharply at the sight of the uniform. Although<br> Pitty had written that Atlanta was garrisoned and the streets full<br> of soldiers, the first sight of the bluecoat startled and<br> frightened her. It was hard to remember that the war was over and<br> that this man would not pursue her, rob her and insult her.<br><br> The comparative emptiness around the train took her mind back to<br> that morning in 1862 when she had come to Atlanta as a young widow,<br> swathed in crepe and wild with boredom. She recalled how crowded<br> this space had been with wagons and carriages and ambulances and<br> how noisy with drivers swearing and yelling and people calling<br> greetings to friends. She sighed for the light-hearted excitement<br> of the war days and sighed again at the thought of walking all the<br> way to Aunt Pitty's house. But she was hopeful that once on<br> Peachtree Street, she might meet someone she knew who would give<br> them a ride.<br><br> As she stood looking about her a saddle-colored negro of middle age<br> drove the closed carriage toward her and, leaning from the box,<br> questioned: ‘Cah'ige, lady? Two bits fer any whar in 'Lanta.’<br><br> Mammy threw him an annihilating glance.<br><br> ‘A hired hack!’ she rumbled. ‘Nigger, does you know who we is?’<br><br> Mammy was a country negro but she had not always been a country<br> negro and she knew that no chaste woman ever rode in a hired<br> conveyance--especially a closed carriage--without the escort of<br> some male member of her family. Even the presence of a negro maid<br> would not satisfy the conventions. She gave Scarlett a glare as<br> she saw her look longingly at the hack.<br><br> ‘Come 'way frum dar, Miss Scarlett! A hired hack an' a free issue<br> nigger! Well, dat's a good combination.’<br><br> ‘Ah ain' no free issue nigger,’ declared the driver with heat. ‘Ah<br> b'longs ter Ole Miss Talbot an' disyere her cah'ige an' Ah drives<br> it ter mek money fer us.’<br><br> ‘Whut Miss Talbot is dat?’<br><br> ‘Miss Suzannah Talbot of Milledgeville. Us done move up hyah affer<br> Old Marse wuz kilt.’<br><br> ‘Does you know her, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Scarlett, regretfully. ‘I know so few Milledgeville<br> folks.’<br><br> ‘Den us'll walk,’ said Mammy sternly. ‘Drive on, nigger.’<br><br> She picked up the carpetbag which held Scarlett's new velvet frock<br> and bonnet and nightgown and tucked the neat bandanna bundle that<br> contained her own belongings under her arm and shepherded Scarlett<br> across the wet expanse of cinders. Scarlett did not argue the<br> matter, much as she preferred to ride, for she wished no<br> disagreement with Mammy. Ever since yesterday afternoon when Mammy<br> had caught her with the velvet curtains, there had been an alert<br> suspicious look in her eyes which Scarlett did not like. It was<br> going to be difficult to escape from her chaperonage and she did<br> not intend to rouse Mammy's fighting blood before it was absolutely<br> necessary.<br><br> As they walked along the narrow sidewalk toward Peachtree, Scarlett<br> was dismayed and sorrowful, for Atlanta looked so devastated and<br> different from what she remembered. They passed beside what had<br> been the Atlanta Hotel where Rhett and Uncle Henry had lived and of<br> that elegant hostelry there remained only a shell, a part of the<br> blackened walls. The warehouses which had bordered the train<br> tracks for a quarter of a mile and held tons of military supplies<br> had not been rebuilt and their rectangular foundations looked<br> dreary under the dark sky. Without the wall of buildings on either<br> side and with the car shed gone, the railroad tracks seemed bare<br> and exposed. Somewhere amid these ruins, undistinguishable from<br> the others, lay what remained of her own warehouse on the property<br> Charles had left her. Uncle Henry had paid last year's taxes on it<br> for her. She'd have to repay that money some time. That was<br> something else to worry about.<br><br> As they turned the corner into Peachtree Street and she looked<br> toward Five Points, she cried out with shock. Despite all Frank<br> had told her about the town burning to the ground, she had never<br> really visualized complete destruction. In her mind the town she<br> loved so well still stood full of close-packed buildings and fine<br> houses. But this Peachtree Street she was looking upon was so<br> denuded of landmarks it was as unfamiliar as if she had never seen<br> it before. This muddy street down which she had driven a thousand<br> times during the war, along which she had fled with ducked head and<br> fear-quickened legs when shells burst over her during the siege,<br> this street she had last seen in the heat and hurry and anguish of<br> the day of the retreat, was so strange looking she felt like<br> crying.<br><br> Though many new buildings had sprung up in the year since Sherman<br> marched out of the burning town and the Confederates returned,<br> there were still wide vacant lots around Five Points where heaps of<br> smudged broken bricks lay amid a jumble of rubbish, dead weeds and<br> broom-sedge. There were the remains of a few buildings she<br> remembered, roofless brick walls through which the dull daylight<br> shone, glassless windows gaping, chimneys towering lonesomely.<br> Here and there her eyes gladly picked out a familiar store which<br> had partly survived shell and fire and had been repaired, the fresh<br> red of new brick glaring bright against the smut of the old walls.<br> On new store fronts and new office windows she saw the welcome<br> names of men she knew but more often the names were unfamiliar,<br> especially the dozens of shingles of strange doctors and lawyers<br> and cotton merchants. Once she had known practically everyone in<br> Atlanta and the sight of so many strange names depressed her. But<br> she was cheered by the sight of new buildings going up all along<br> the street.<br><br> There were dozens of them and several were three stories high!<br> Everywhere building was going on, for as she looked down the<br> street, trying to adjust her mind to the new Atlanta, she heard the<br> blithe sound of hammers and saws, noticed scaffoldings rising and<br> saw men climbing ladders with hods of bricks on their shoulders.<br> She looked down the street she loved so well and her eyes misted a<br> little.<br><br> ‘They burned you,’ she thought, ‘and they laid you flat. But they<br> didn't lick you. They couldn't lick you. You'll grow back just as<br> big and sassy as you used to be!’<br><br> As she walked along Peachtree, followed by the waddling Mammy, she<br> found the sidewalks just as crowded as they were at the height of<br> the war and there was the same air of rush and bustle about the<br> resurrecting town which had made her blood sing when she came here,<br> so long ago, on her first visit to Aunt Pitty. There seemed to be<br> just as many vehicles wallowing in the mud holes as there had been<br> then, except that there were no Confederate ambulances, and just as<br> many horses and mules tethered to hitching racks in front of the<br> wooden awnings of the stores. Though the sidewalks were jammed,<br> the faces she saw were as unfamiliar as the signs overhead, new<br> people, many rough-looking men and tawdrily dressed women. The<br> streets were black with loafing negroes who leaned against walls or<br> sat on the curbing watching vehicles go past with the naive<br> curiosity of children at a circus parade.<br><br> ‘Free issue country niggers,’ snorted Mammy. ‘Ain' never seed a<br> proper cah'ige in dere lives. An' impident lookin', too.’<br><br> They were impudent looking, Scarlett agreed, for they stared at her<br> in an insolent manner, but she forgot them in the renewed shock of<br> seeing blue uniforms. The town was full of Yankee soldiers, on<br> horses, afoot, in army wagons, loafing on the street, reeling out<br> of barrooms.<br><br> I'll never get used to them, she thought, clenching her fists.<br> Never! and over her shoulder: ‘Hurry, Mammy, let's get out of this<br> crowd.’<br><br> ‘Soon's Ah kick dis black trash outer mah way,’ answered Mammy<br> loudly, swinging the carpetbag at a black buck who loitered<br> tantalizingly in front of her and making him leap aside. ‘Ah doan<br> lak disyere town, Miss Scarlett. It's too full of Yankees an'<br> cheap free issue.’<br><br> ‘It's nicer where it isn't so crowded. When we get across Five<br> Points, it won't be so bad.’<br><br> They picked their way across the slippery stepping stones that<br> bridged the mud of Decatur Street and continued up Peachtree,<br> through a thinning crowd. When they reached Wesley Chapel where<br> Scarlett had paused to catch her breath that day in 1864 when she<br> had run for Dr. Meade, she looked at it and laughed aloud, shortly<br> and grimly. Mammy's quick old eyes sought hers with suspicion and<br> question but her curiosity went unsatisfied. Scarlett was<br> recalling with contempt the terror which had ridden her that day.<br> She had been crawling with fear, rotten with fear, terrified by the<br> Yankees, terrified by the approaching birth of Beau. Now she<br> wondered how she could have been so frightened, frightened like a<br> child at a loud noise. And what a child she had been to think that<br> Yankees and fire and defeat were the worst things that could happen<br> to her! What trivialities they were beside Ellen's death and<br> Gerald's vagueness, beside hunger and cold and back-breaking work<br> and the living nightmare of insecurity. How easy she would find it<br> now to be brave before an invading army, but how hard to face the<br> danger that threatened Tara! No, she would never again be afraid<br> of anything except poverty.<br><br> Up Peachtree came a closed carriage and Scarlett went to the curb<br> eagerly to see if she knew the occupant, for Aunt Pitty's house was<br> still several blocks away. She and Mammy leaned forward as the<br> carriage came abreast and Scarlett, with a smile arranged, almost<br> called out when a woman's head appeared for a moment at the window--<br> a too bright red head beneath a fine fur hat. Scarlett took a<br> step back as mutual recognition leaped into both faces. It was<br> Belle Watling and Scarlett had a glimpse of nostrils distended with<br> dislike before she disappeared again. Strange that Belle's should<br> be the first familiar face she saw.<br><br> ‘Who dat?’ questioned Mammy suspiciously. ‘She knowed you but she<br> din' bow. Ah ain' never seed ha'r dat color in mah life. Not even<br> in de Tarleton fambly. It look--well, it look dyed ter me!’<br><br> ‘It is,’ said Scarlett shortly, walking faster.<br><br> ‘Does you know a dyed-ha'rd woman? Ah ast you who she is.’<br><br> ‘She's the town bad woman,’ said Scarlett briefly, ‘and I give you<br> my word I don't know her, so shut up.’<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty!’ breathed Mammy, her jaw dropping as she looked after<br> the carriage with passionate curiosity. She had not seen a<br> professional bad woman since she left Savannah with Ellen more than<br> twenty years before and she wished ardently that she had observed<br> Belle more closely.<br><br> ‘She sho dressed up fine an' got a fine cah'ige an' coachman,’ she<br> muttered. ‘Ah doan know whut de Lawd thinkin' 'bout lettin' de bad<br> women flurrish lak dat w'en us good folks is hongry an' mos'<br> barefoot.’<br><br> ‘The Lord stopped thinking about us years ago,’ said Scarlett<br> savagely. ‘And don't go telling me Mother is turning in her grave<br> to hear me say it, either.’<br><br> She wanted to feel superior and virtuous about Belle but she could<br> not. If her plans went well, she might be on the same footing with<br> Belle and supported by the same man. While she did not regret her<br> decision one whit, the matter in its true light discomfited her.<br> ‘I won't think of it now,’ she told herself and hurried her steps.<br><br> They passed the lot where the Meade house had stood and there<br> remained of it only a forlorn pair of stone steps and a walk,<br> leading up to nothing. Where the Whitings' home had been was bare<br> ground. Even the foundation stones and the brick chimneys were<br> gone and there were wagon tracks where they had been carted away.<br> The brick house of the Elsings still stood, with a new roof and a<br> new second floor. The Bonnell home, awkwardly patched and roofed<br> with rude boards instead of shingles, managed to look livable for<br> all its battered appearance. But in neither house was there a face<br> at the window or a figure on the porch, and Scarlett was glad. She<br> did not want to talk to anyone now.<br><br> Then the new slate roof of Aunt Pitty's house came in view with its<br> red-brick walls, and Scarlett's heart throbbed. How good of the<br> Lord not to level it beyond repair! Coming out of the front yard<br> was Uncle Peter, a market basket on his arm, and when he saw<br> Scarlett and Mammy trudging along, a wide, incredulous smile split<br> his black face.<br><br> I could kiss the old black fool, I'm so glad to see him, thought<br> Scarlett, joyfully and she called: ‘Run get Auntie's swoon bottle,<br> Peter! It's really me!’<br><br> <br><br> That night the inevitable hominy and dried peas were on Aunt<br> Pitty's supper table and, as Scarlett ate them, she made a vow that<br> these two dishes would never appear on her table when she had money<br> again. And, no matter what price she had to pay, she was going to<br> have money again, more than just enough to pay the taxes on Tara.<br> Somehow, some day she was going to have plenty of money if she had<br> to commit murder to get it.<br><br> In the yellow lamplight of the dining room, she asked Pitty about<br> her finances, hoping against hope that Charles' family might be<br> able to lend her the money she needed. The questions were none too<br> subtle but Pitty, in her pleasure at having a member of the family<br> to talk to, did not even notice the bald way the questions were<br> put. She plunged with tears into the details of her misfortunes.<br> She just didn't know where her farms and town property and money<br> had gone but everything had slipped away. At least, that was what<br> Brother Henry told her. He hadn't been able to pay the taxes on<br> her estate. Everything except the house she was living in was gone<br> and Pitty did not stop to think that the house had never been hers<br> but was the joint property of Melanie and Scarlett. Brother Henry<br> could just barely pay taxes on this house. He gave her a little<br> something every month to live on and, though it was very<br> humiliating to take money from him, she had to do it.<br><br> ‘Brother Henry says he doesn't know how he'll make ends meet with<br> the load he's carrying and the taxes so high but, of course, he's<br> probably lying and has loads of money and just won't give me much.’<br><br> Scarlett knew Uncle Henry wasn't lying. The few letters she had<br> had from him in connection with Charles' property showed that. The<br> old lawyer was battling valiantly to save the house and the one<br> piece of downtown property where the warehouse had been, so Wade<br> and Scarlett would have something left from the wreckage. Scarlett<br> knew he was carrying these taxes for her at a great sacrifice.<br><br> ‘Of course, he hasn't any money,’ thought Scarlett grimly. ‘Well,<br> check him and Aunt Pitty off my list. There's nobody left but<br> Rhett. I'll have to do it. I must do it. But I mustn't think<br> about it now. . . . I must get her to talking about Rhett so I can<br> casually suggest to her to invite him to call tomorrow.’<br><br> She smiled and squeezed the plump palms of Aunt Pitty between her<br> own.<br><br> ‘Darling Auntie,’ she said, ‘don't let's talk about distressing<br> things like money any more. Let's forget about them and talk of<br> pleasanter things. You must tell me all the news about our old<br> friends. How is Mrs. Merriwether and Maybelle? I heard that<br> Maybelle's little Creole came home safely. How are the Elsings and<br> Dr. and Mrs. Meade?’<br><br> Pittypat brightened at the change of subject and her baby face<br> stopped quivering with tears. She gave detailed reports about old<br> neighbors, what they were doing and wearing and eating and<br> thinking. She told with accents of horror how, before Rene Picard<br> came home from the war, Mrs. Merriwether and Maybelle had made ends<br> meet by baking pies and selling them to the Yankee soldiers.<br> Imagine that! Sometimes there were two dozen Yankees standing in<br> the back yard of the Merriwether home, waiting for the baking to be<br> finished. Now that Rene was home, he drove an old wagon to the<br> Yankee camp every day and sold cakes and pies and beaten biscuits<br> to the soldiers. Mrs. Merriwether said that when she made a little<br> more money she was going to open a bake shop downtown. Pitty did<br> not wish to criticize but after all-- As for herself, said Pitty,<br> she would rather starve than have such commerce with Yankees. She<br> made a point of giving a disdainful look to every soldier she met,<br> and crossed to the other side of the street in as insulting a<br> manner as possible, though, she said, this was quite inconvenient<br> in wet weather. Scarlett gathered that no sacrifice, even though<br> it be muddy shoes, was too great to show loyalty to the Confederacy<br> in so far as Miss Pittypat was concerned.<br><br> Mrs. Meade and the doctor had lost their home when the Yankees<br> fired the town and they had neither the money nor the heart to<br> rebuild, now that Phil and Darcy were dead. Mrs. Meade said she<br> never wanted a home again, for what was a home without children and<br> grandchildren in it? They were very lonely and had gone to live<br> with the Elsings who had rebuilt the damaged part of their home.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Whiting had a room there, too, and Mrs. Bonnell was<br> talking of moving in, if she was fortunate enough to rent her house<br> to a Yankee officer and his family.<br><br> ‘But how do they all squeeze in?’ cried Scarlett. ‘There's Mrs.<br> Elsing and Fanny and Hugh--’<br><br> ‘Mrs. Elsing and Fanny sleep in the parlor and Hugh in the attic,’<br> explained Pitty, who knew the domestic arrangements of all her<br> friends. ‘My dear, I do hate to tell you this but--Mrs. Elsing<br> calls them 'paying guests' but,’ Pitty dropped her voice, ‘they are<br> really nothing at all except boarders. Mrs. Elsing is running a<br> boarding house! Isn't that dreadful?’<br><br> ‘I think it's wonderful,’ said Scarlett shortly. ‘I only wish we'd<br> had 'paying guests' at Tara for the last year instead of free<br> boarders. Maybe we wouldn't be so poor now.’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, how can you say such things? Your poor mother must be<br> turning in her grave at the very thought of charging money for the<br> hospitality of Tara! Of course, Mrs. Elsing was simply forced to<br> it because, while she took in fine sewing and Fanny painted china<br> and Hugh made a little money peddling firewood, they couldn't make<br> ends meet. Imagine darling Hugh forced to peddle wood! And he all<br> set to be a fine lawyer! I could just cry at the things our boys<br> are reduced to!’<br><br> Scarlett thought of the rows of cotton beneath the glaring coppery<br> sky at Tara and how her back had ached as she bent over them. She<br> remembered the feel of plow handles between her inexperienced,<br> blistered palms and she felt that Hugh Elsing was deserving of no<br> special sympathy. What an innocent old fool Pitty was and, despite<br> the ruin all around her, how sheltered!<br><br> ‘If he doesn't like peddling, why doesn't he practice law? Or<br> isn't there any law practice left in Atlanta?’<br><br> ‘Oh dear, yes! There's plenty of law practice. Practically<br> everybody is suing everybody else these days. With everything<br> burned down and boundary lines wiped out, no one knows just where<br> their land begins or ends. But you can't get any pay for suing<br> because nobody has any money. So Hugh sticks to his peddling. . . .<br> Oh, I almost forgot! Did I write you? Fanny Elsing is getting<br> married tomorrow night and, of course, you must attend. Mrs.<br> Elsing will be only too pleased to have you when she knows you're<br> in town. I do hope you have some other frock besides that one.<br> Not that it isn't a very sweet frock, darling, but--well, it does<br> look a bit worn. Oh, you have a pretty frock? I'm so glad because<br> it's going to be the first real wedding we've had in Atlanta since<br> before the town fell. Cake and wine and dancing afterward, though<br> I don't know how the Elsings can afford it, they are so poor.’<br><br> ‘Who is Fanny marrying? I thought after Dallas McLure was killed<br> at Gettysburg--’<br><br> ‘Darling, you mustn't criticize Fanny. Everybody isn't as loyal to<br> the dead as you are to poor Charlie. Let me see. What is his<br> name? I can never remember names--Tom somebody. I knew his mother<br> well, we went to LaGrange Female Institute together. She was a<br> Tomlinson from LaGrange and her mother was--let me see. . . .<br> Perkins? Parkins? Parkinson! That's it. From Sparta. A very<br> good family but just the same--well, I know I shouldn't say it but<br> I don't see how Fanny can bring herself to marry him!’<br><br> ‘Does he drink or--’<br><br> ‘Dear, no! His character is perfect but, you see, he was wounded<br> low down, by a bursting shell and it did something to his legs--<br> makes them--makes them, well, I hate to use the word but it makes<br> him spraddle. It gives him a very vulgar appearance when he walks--<br> well, it doesn't look very pretty. I don't see why she's marrying<br> him.’<br><br> ‘Girls have to marry someone.’<br><br> ‘Indeed, they do not,’ said Pitty, ruffling. ‘I never had to.’<br><br> ‘Now, darling, I didn't mean you! Everybody knows how popular you<br> were and still are! Why, old Judge Canton used to throw sheep's<br> eyes at you till I--’<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett, hush! That old fool!’ giggled Pitty, good humor<br> restored. ‘But, after all, Fanny was so popular she could have<br> made a better match and I don't believe she loves this Tom what's-<br> his-name. I don't believe she's ever gotten over Dallas McLure<br> getting killed, but she's not like you, darling. You've remained<br> so faithful to dear Charlie, though you could have married dozens<br> of times. Melly and I have often said how loyal you were to his<br> memory when everyone else said you were just a heartless coquette.’<br><br> Scarlett passed over this tactless confidence and skillfully led<br> Pitty from one friend to another but all the while she was in a<br> fever of impatience to bring the conversation around to Rhett. It<br> would never do for her to ask outright about him, so soon after<br> arriving. It might start the old lady's mind to working on<br> channels better left untouched. There would be time enough for<br> Pitty's suspicions to be aroused if Rhett refused to marry her.<br><br> Aunt Pitty prattled on happily, pleased as a child at having an<br> audience. Things in Atlanta were in a dreadful pass, she said, due<br> to the vile doings of the Republicans. There was no end to their<br> goings on and the worst thing was the way they were putting ideas<br> in the poor darkies' heads.<br><br> ‘My dear, they want to let the darkies vote! Did you ever hear of<br> anything more silly? Though--I don't know--now that I think about<br> it, Uncle Peter has much more sense than any Republican I ever saw<br> and much better manners but, of course, Uncle Peter is far too well<br> bred to want to vote. But the very notion has upset the darkies<br> till they're right addled. And some of them are so insolent. Your<br> life isn't safe on the streets after dark and even in the broad<br> daylight they push ladies off the sidewalks into the mud. And if<br> any gentleman dares to protest, they arrest him and-- My dear, did<br> I tell you that Captain Butler was in jail?’<br><br> ‘Rhett Butler?’<br><br> Even with this startling news, Scarlett was grateful that Aunt<br> Pitty had saved her the necessity of bringing his name into the<br> conversation herself.<br><br> ‘Yes, indeed!’ Excitement colored Pitty's cheeks pink and she sat<br> upright. ‘He's in jail this very minute for killing a negro and<br> they may hang him! Imagine Captain Butler hanging!’<br><br> For a moment, the breath went out of Scarlett's lungs in a<br> sickening gasp and she could only stare at the fat old lady who was<br> so obviously pleased at the effect of her statement.<br><br> ‘They haven't proved it yet but somebody killed this darky who had<br> insulted a white woman. And the Yankees are very upset because so<br> many uppity darkies have been killed recently. They can't prove it<br> on Captain Butler but they want to make an example of someone, so<br> Dr. Meade says. The doctor says that if they do hang him it will<br> be the first good honest job the Yankees ever did, but then, I<br> don't know. . . . And to think that Captain Butler was here just a<br> week ago and brought me the loveliest quail you ever saw for a<br> present and he was asking about you and saying he feared he had<br> offended you during the siege and you would never forgive him.’<br><br> ‘How long will he be in jail?’<br><br> ‘Nobody knows. Perhaps till they hang him, but maybe they won't be<br> able to prove the killing on him, after all. However, it doesn't<br> seem to bother the Yankees whether folks are guilty or not, so long<br> as they can hang somebody. They are so upset’--Pitty dropped her<br> voice mysteriously--’about the Ku Klux Klan. Do you have the Klan<br> down in the County? My dear, I'm sure you must and Ashley just<br> doesn't tell you girls anything about it. Klansmen aren't supposed<br> to tell. They ride around at night dressed up like ghosts and call<br> on Carpetbaggers who steal money and negroes who are uppity.<br> Sometimes they just scare them and warn them to leave Atlanta, but<br> when they don't behave they whip them and,’ Pitty whispered,<br> ‘sometimes they kill them and leave them where they'll be easily<br> found with the Ku Klux card on them. . . . And the Yankees are<br> very angry about it and want to make an example of someone. . . .<br> But Hugh Elsing told me he didn't think they'd hang Captain Butler<br> because the Yankees think he does know where the money is and just<br> won't tell. They are trying to make him tell.’<br><br> ‘The money?’<br><br> ‘Didn't you know? Didn't I write you? My dear, you have been<br> buried at Tara, haven't you? The town simply buzzed when Captain<br> Butler came back here with a fine horse and carriage and his<br> pockets full of money, when all the rest of us didn't know where<br> our next meal was coming from. It simply made everybody furious<br> that an old speculator who always said nasty things about the<br> Confederacy should have so much money when we were all so poor.<br> Everybody was bursting to know how he managed to save his money but<br> no one had the courage to ask him--except me and he just laughed<br> and said: 'In no honest way, you may be sure.' You know how hard<br> it is to get anything sensible out of him.’<br><br> ‘But of course, he made his money out of the blockade--’<br><br> ‘Of course, he did, honey, some of it. But that's not a drop in<br> the bucket to what that man has really got. Everybody, including<br> the Yankees, believes he's got millions of dollars in gold<br> belonging to the Confederate government hid out somewhere.’<br><br> ‘Millions--in gold?’<br><br> ‘Well, honey, where did all our Confederate gold go to? Somebody<br> got it and Captain Butler must be one of the somebodies. The<br> Yankees thought President Davis had it when he left Richmond but<br> when they captured the poor man he had hardly a cent. There just<br> wasn't any money m the treasury when the war was over and everybody<br> thinks some of the blockade runners got it and are keeping quiet<br> about it.’<br><br> ‘Millions--in gold! But how--’<br><br> ‘Didn't Captain Butler take thousands of bales of cotton to England<br> and Nassau to sell for the Confederate government?’ asked Pitty<br> triumphantly. ‘Not only his own cotton but government cotton too?<br> And you know what cotton brought in England during the war! Any<br> price you wanted to ask! He was a free agent acting for the<br> government and he was supposed to sell the cotton and buy guns with<br> the money and run the guns in for us. Well, when the blockade got<br> too tight, he couldn't bring in the guns and he couldn't have spent<br> one one-hundredth of the cotton money on them anyway, so there<br> were simply millions of dollars in English banks put there by<br> Captain Butler and other blockaders, waiting till the blockade<br> loosened. And you can't tell me they banked that money in the name<br> of the Confederacy. They put it in their own names and it's still<br> there. . . . Everybody has been talking about it ever since the<br> surrender and criticizing the blockaders severely, and when the<br> Yankees arrested Captain Butler for killing this darky they must<br> have heard the rumor, because they've been at him to tell them where<br> the money is. You see, all of our Confederate funds belong to the<br> Yankees now--at least, the Yankees think so. But Captain Butler<br> says he doesn't know anything. . . . Dr. Meade says they ought to<br> hang him anyhow, only hanging is too good for a thief and a<br> profiteer-- Dear, you look so oddly! Do you feel faint? Have I<br> upset you talking like this? I knew he was once a beau of yours but<br> I thought you'd fallen out long ago. Personally, I never approved<br> of him, for he's such a scamp--’<br><br> ‘He's no friend of mine,’ said Scarlett with an effort. ‘I had a<br> quarrel with him during the siege, after you went to Macon. Where--<br> where is he?’<br><br> ‘In the firehouse over near the public square!’<br><br> ‘In the firehouse?’<br><br> Aunt Pitty crowed with laughter.<br><br> ‘Yes, he's in the firehouse. The Yankees use it for a military<br> jail now. The Yankees are camped in huts all round the city hall<br> in the square and the firehouse is just down the street, so that's<br> where Captain Butler is. And Scarlett, I heard the funniest thing<br> yesterday about Captain Butler. I forget who told me. You know<br> how well groomed he always was--really a dandy--and they've been<br> keeping him in the firehouse and not letting him bathe and every<br> day he's been insisting that he wanted a bath and finally they led<br> him out of his cell onto the square and there was a long horse<br> trough where the whole regiment had bathed in the same water! And<br> they told him he could bathe there and he said No, that he<br> preferred his own brand of Southern dirt to Yankee dirt and--’<br><br> Scarlett heard the cheerful babbling voice going on and on but she<br> did not hear the words. In her mind there were only two ideas,<br> Rhett had more money than she had even hoped and he was in jail.<br> The fact that he was in jail and possibly might be hanged changed<br> the face of matters somewhat, in fact made them look a little<br> brighter. She had very little feeling about Rhett being hanged.<br> Her need of money was too pressing, too desperate, for her to<br> bother about his ultimate fate. Besides, she half shared Dr.<br> Meade's opinion that hanging was too good for him. Any man who'd<br> leave a woman stranded between two armies in the middle of the<br> night, just to go off and fight for a Cause already lost, deserved<br> hanging. . . . If she could somehow manage to marry him while he<br> was in jail, all those millions would be hers and hers alone should<br> he be executed. And if marriage was not possible, perhaps she<br> could get a loan from him by promising to marry him when he was<br> released or by promising--oh promising anything! And if they<br> hanged him, her day of settlement would never come.<br><br> For a moment her imagination flamed at the thought of being made a<br> widow by the kindly intervention of the Yankee government.<br> Millions in gold! She could repair Tara and hire hands and plant<br> miles and miles of cotton. And she could have pretty clothes and<br> all she wanted to eat and so could Suellen and Carreen. And Wade<br> could have nourishing food to fill out his thin cheeks and warm<br> clothes and a governess and afterward go to the university . . .<br> and not grow up barefooted and ignorant like a Cracker. And a good<br> doctor could look after Pa and as for Ashley--what couldn't she do<br> for Ashley!<br><br> Aunt Pittypat's monologue broke off suddenly as she said<br> inquiringly: ‘Yes, Mammy?’ and Scarlett, coming back from dreams,<br> saw Mammy standing in the doorway, her hands under her apron and in<br> her eyes an alert piercing look. She wondered how long Mammy had<br> been standing there and how much she had heard and observed.<br> Probably everything, to judge by the gleam in her old eyes.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett look lak she tared. Ah spec she better go ter bed.’<br><br> ‘I am tired,’ said Scarlett, rising and meeting Mammy's eyes with a<br> childlike, helpless look, ‘and I'm afraid I'm catching a cold too.<br> Aunt Pitty, would you mind if I stayed in bed tomorrow and didn't<br> go calling with you? I can go calling any time and I'm so anxious<br> to go to Fanny's wedding tomorrow night. And if my cold gets worse<br> I won't be able to go. And a day in bed would be such a lovely<br> treat for me.’<br><br> Mammy's look changed to faint worry as she felt Scarlett's hands<br> and looked into her face. She certainly didn't look well. The<br> excitement of her thoughts had abruptly ebbed, leaving her white<br> and shaking.<br><br> ‘Yo' han's lak ice, honey. You come ter bed an' Ah'll brew you<br> some sassfrass tea an' git you a hot brick ter mek you sweat.’<br><br> ‘How thoughtless I've been,’ cried the plump old lady, hopping from<br> her chair and patting Scarlett's arm. ‘Just chattering on and not<br> thinking of you. Honey, you shall stay in bed all tomorrow and<br> rest up and we can gossip together-- Oh, dear, no! I can't be<br> with you. I've promised to sit with Mrs. Bonnell tomorrow. She is<br> down with la grippe and so is her cook. Mammy, I'm so glad you are<br> here. You must go over with me in the morning and help me.’<br><br> Mammy hurried Scarlett up the dark stairs, muttering fussy remarks<br> about cold hands and thin shoes and Scarlett looked meek and was<br> well content. If she could only lull Mammy's suspicions further<br> and get her out of the house in the morning, all would be well.<br> Then she could go to the Yankee jail and see Rhett. As she climbed<br> the stairs, the faint rumbling of thunder began and, standing on<br> the well-remembered landing, she thought how like the siege cannon<br> it sounded. She shivered. Forever, thunder would mean cannon and<br> war to her.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXIV<br><br> <br> The sun shone intermittently the next morning and the hard wind<br> that drove dark clouds swiftly across its face rattled the<br> windowpanes and moaned faintly about the house. Scarlett said a<br> brief prayer of thanksgiving that the rain of the previous night<br> had ceased, for she had lain awake listening to it, knowing that it<br> would mean the ruin of her velvet dress and new bonnet. Now that<br> she could catch fleeting glimpses of the sun, her spirits soared.<br> She could hardly remain in bed and look languid and make croaking<br> noises until Aunt Pitty, Mammy and Uncle Peter were out of the<br> house and on their way to Mrs. Bonnell's. When, at last, the front<br> gate banged and she was alone in the house, except for Cookie who<br> was singing in the kitchen, she leaped from the bed and lifted her<br> new clothes from the closet hooks.<br><br> Sleep had refreshed her and given her strength and from the cold<br> hard core at the bottom of her heart, she drew courage. There was<br> something about the prospect of a struggle of wits with a man--with<br> any man--that put her on her mettle and, after months of battling<br> against countless discouragements, the knowledge that she was at<br> last facing a definite adversary, one whom she might unhorse by her<br> own efforts, gave her a buoyant sensation.<br><br> Dressing unaided was difficult but she finally accomplished it and<br> putting on the bonnet with its rakish feathers she ran to Aunt<br> Pitty's room to preen herself in front of the long mirror. How<br> pretty she looked! The cock feathers gave her a dashing air and<br> the dull-green velvet of the bonnet made her eyes startlingly<br> bright, almost emerald colored. And the dress was incomparable, so<br> rich and handsome looking and yet so dignified! It was wonderful<br> to have a lovely dress again. It was so nice to know that she<br> looked pretty and provocative, and she impulsively bent forward and<br> kissed her reflection in the mirror and then laughed at her own<br> foolishness. She picked up Ellen's Paisley shawl to wrap about her<br> but the colors of the faded old square clashed with the moss-green<br> dress and made her appear a little shabby. Opening Aunt Pitty's<br> closet she removed a black broadcloth cloak, a thin fall garment<br> which Pitty used only for Sunday wear, and put it on. She slipped<br> into her pierced ears the diamond earrings she had brought from<br> Tara, and tossed her head to observe the effect. They made<br> pleasant clicking noises which were very satisfactory and she<br> thought that she must remember to toss her head frequently when<br> with Rhett. Dancing earrings always attracted a man and gave a<br> girl such a spirited air.<br><br> What a shame Aunt Pitty had no other gloves than the ones now on<br> her fat hands! No woman could really feel like a lady without<br> gloves, but Scarlett had not had a pair since she left Atlanta.<br> And the long months of hard work at Tara had roughened her hands<br> until they were far from pretty. Well, it couldn't be helped.<br> She'd take Aunt Pitty's little seal muff and hide her bare hands in<br> it. Scarlett felt that it gave her the final finishing touch of<br> elegance. No one, looking at her now, would suspect that poverty<br> and want were standing at her shoulder.<br><br> It was so important that Rhett should not suspect. He must not<br> think that anything but tender feelings were driving her.<br><br> She tiptoed down the stairs and out of the house while Cookie<br> bawled on unconcernedly in the kitchen. She hastened down Baker<br> Street to avoid the all seeing eyes of the neighbors and sat down<br> on a carriage block on Ivy Street in front of a burned house, to<br> wait for some passing carriage or wagon which would give her a<br> ride. The sun dipped in and out from behind hurrying clouds,<br> lighting the street with a false brightness which had no warmth in<br> it, and the wind fluttered the lace of her pantalets. It was<br> colder than she had expected and she wrapped Aunt Pitty's thin<br> cloak about her and shivered impatiently. Just as she was<br> preparing to start walking the long way across town to the Yankee<br> encampment, a battered wagon appeared. In it was an old woman with<br> a lip full of snuff and a weather-beaten face under a drab<br> sunbonnet, driving a dawdling old mule. She was going in the<br> direction of the city hall and she grudgingly gave Scarlett a ride.<br> But it was obvious that the dress, bonnet and muff found no favor<br> with her.<br><br> ‘She thinks I'm a hussy,’ thought Scarlett. ‘And perhaps she's<br> right at that!’<br><br> When at last they reached the town square and the tall white cupola<br> of the city hall loomed up, she made her thanks, climbed down from<br> the wagon and watched the country woman drive off. Looking around<br> carefully to see that she was not observed, she pinched her cheeks<br> to give them color and bit her lips until they stung to make them<br> red. She adjusted the bonnet and smoothed back her hair and looked<br> about the square. The two-story red-brick city hall had survived<br> the burning of the city. But it looked forlorn and unkempt under<br> the gray sky. Surrounding the building completely and covering the<br> square of land of which it was the center were row after row of<br> army huts, dingy and mud splashed. Yankee soldiers loitered<br> everywhere and Scarlett looked at them uncertainly, some of her<br> courage deserting her. How would she go about finding Rhett in<br> this enemy camp?<br><br> She looked down the street toward the firehouse and saw that the<br> wide arched doors were closed and heavily barred and two sentries<br> passed and repassed on each side of the building. Rhett was in<br> there. But what should she say to the Yankee soldiers? And what<br> would they say to her? She squared her shoulders. If she hadn't<br> been afraid to kill one Yankee, she shouldn't fear merely talking<br> to another.<br><br> She picked her way precariously across the stepping stones of the<br> muddy street and walked forward until a sentry, his blue overcoat<br> buttoned high against the wind, stopped her.<br><br> ‘What is it, Ma'm?’ His voice had a strange mid-Western twang but<br> it was polite and respectful.<br><br> ‘I want to see a man in there--he is a prisoner.’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know,’ said the sentry, scratching his head. ‘They<br> are mighty particular about visitors and--’ He stopped and peered<br> into her face sharply. ‘Lord, lady! Don't you cry! You go over<br> to post headquarters and ask the officers. They'll let you see<br> him, I bet.’<br><br> Scarlett, who had no intention of crying, beamed at him. He turned<br> to another sentry who was slowly pacing his beat: ‘Yee-ah, Bill.<br> Come'eer.’<br><br> The second sentry, a large man muffled in a blue overcoat from<br> which villainous black whiskers burst, came through the mud toward<br> them.<br><br> ‘You take this lady to headquarters.’<br><br> Scarlett thanked him and followed the sentry.<br><br> ‘Mind you don't turn your ankle on those stepping stones,’ said the<br> soldier, taking her arm. ‘And you'd better hist up your skirts a<br> little to keep them out of the mud.’<br><br> The voice issuing from the whiskers had the same nasal twang but<br> was kind and pleasant and his hand was firm and respectful. Why,<br> Yankees weren't bad at all!<br><br> ‘It's a mighty cold day for a lady to be out in,’ said her escort.<br> ‘Have you come a fer piece?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, from clear across the other side of town,’ she said,<br> warming to the kindness in his voice.<br><br> ‘This ain't no weather for a lady to be out in,’ said the soldier<br> reprovingly, ‘with all this la grippe in the air. Here's Post<br> Command, lady-- What's the matter?’<br><br> ‘This house--this house is your headquarters?’ Scarlett looked up<br> at the lovely old dwelling facing on the square and could have<br> cried. She had been to so many parties in this house during the<br> war. It had been a gay beautiful place and now--there was a large<br> United States flag floating over it.<br><br> ‘What's the matter?’<br><br> ‘Nothing--only--only--I used to know the people who lived here.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's too bad. I guess they wouldn't know it themselves if<br> they saw it, for it shore is torn up on the inside. Now, you go on<br> in, Ma'm, and ask for the captain.’<br><br> She went up the steps, caressing the broken white banisters, and<br> pushed open the front door. The hall was dark and as cold as a<br> vault and a shivering sentry was leaning against the closed folding<br> doors of what had been, in better days, the dining room.<br><br> ‘I want to see the captain,’ she said.<br><br> He pulled back the doors and she entered the room, her heart beating<br> rapidly, her face flushing with embarrassment and excitement. There<br> was a close stuffy smell in the room, compounded of the smoking<br> fire, tobacco fumes, leather, damp woolen uniforms and unwashed<br> bodies. She had a confused impression of bare walls with torn<br> wallpaper, rows of blue overcoats and slouch hats hung on nails, a<br> roaring fire, a long table covered with papers and a group of<br> officers in blue uniforms with brass buttons.<br><br> She gulped once and found her voice. She mustn't let these Yankees<br> know she was afraid. She must look and be her prettiest and most<br> unconcerned self.<br><br> ‘The captain?’<br><br> ‘I'm one captain,’ said a fat man whose tunic was unbuttoned.<br><br> ‘I want to see a prisoner, Captain Rhett Butler.’<br><br> ‘Butler again? He's popular, that man,’ laughed the captain,<br> taking a chewed cigar from his mouth. ‘You a relative, Ma'm?’<br><br> ‘Yes--his--his sister.’<br><br> He laughed again.<br><br> ‘He's got a lot of sisters, one of them here yesterday.’<br><br> Scarlett flushed. One of those creatures Rhett consorted with,<br> probably that Watling woman. And these Yankees thought she was<br> another one. It was unendurable. Not even for Tara would she stay<br> here another minute and be insulted. She turned to the door and<br> reached angrily for the knob but another officer was by her side<br> quickly. He was clean shaven and young and had merry, kind eyes.<br><br> ‘Just a minute, Ma'm. Won't you sit down here by the fire where<br> it's warm? I'll go see what I can do about it. What is your name?<br> He refused to see the--lady who called yesterday.’<br><br> She sank into the proffered chair, glaring at the discomfited fat<br> captain, and gave her name. The nice young officer slipped on his<br> overcoat and left the room and the others took themselves off to<br> the far end of the table where they talked in low tones and pawed<br> at the papers. She stretched her feet gratefully toward the fire,<br> realizing for the first time how cold they were and wishing she had<br> thought to put a piece of cardboard over the hole in the sole of<br> one slipper. After a time, voices murmured outside the door and<br> she heard Rhett's laugh. The door opened, a cold draft swept the<br> room and Rhett appeared, hatless, a long cape thrown carelessly<br> across his shoulders. He was dirty and unshaven and without a<br> cravat but somehow jaunty despite his dishabille, and his dark eyes<br> were snapping joyfully at the sight of her.<br><br> ‘Scarlett!’<br><br> He had her hands in both of his and, as always, there was something<br> hot and vital and exciting about his grip. Before she quite knew<br> what he was about, he had bent and kissed her cheek, his mustache<br> tickling her. As he felt the startled movement of her body away<br> from him, he hugged her about the shoulders and said: ‘My darling<br> little sister!’ and grinned down at her as if he relished her<br> helplessness in resisting his caress. She couldn't help laughing<br> back at him for the advantage he had taken. What a rogue he was!<br> Jail had not changed him one bit.<br><br> The fat captain was muttering through his cigar to the merry-eyed<br> officer.<br><br> ‘Most irregular. He should be in the firehouse. You know the<br> orders.’<br><br> ‘Oh, for God's sake, Henry! The lady would freeze in that barn.’<br><br> ‘Oh, all right, all right! It's your responsibility.’<br><br> ‘I assure you, gentlemen,’ said Rhett, turning to them but still<br> keeping a grip on Scarlett's shoulders, ‘my--sister hasn't brought<br> me any saws or files to help me escape.’<br><br> They all laughed and, as they did, Scarlett looked quickly about<br> her. Good Heavens, was she going to have to talk to Rhett before<br> six Yankee officers! Was he so dangerous a prisoner they wouldn't<br> let him out of their sight? Seeing her anxious glance, the nice<br> officer pushed open a door and spoke brief low words to two<br> privates who had leaped to their feet at his entrance. They picked<br> up their rifles and went out into the hall, closing the door behind<br> them.<br><br> ‘If you wish, you may sit here in the orderly room,’ said the young<br> captain. ‘And don't try to bolt through that door. The men are<br> just outside.’<br><br> ‘You see what a desperate character I am, Scarlett,’ said Rhett.<br> ‘Thank you, Captain. This is most kind or you.’<br><br> He bowed carelessly and taking Scarlett's arm pulled her to her<br> feet and propelled her into the dingy orderly room. She was never<br> to remember what the room looked like except that it was small and<br> dim and none too warm and there were handwritten papers tacked on<br> the mutilated walls and chairs which had cowhide seats with the<br> hair still on them.<br><br> When he had closed the door behind them, Rhett came to her swiftly<br> and bent over her. Knowing his desire, she turned her head quickly<br> but smiled provocatively at him out of the corners of her eyes.<br><br> ‘Can't I really kiss you now?’<br><br> ‘On the forehead, like a good brother,’ she answered demurely.<br><br> ‘Thank you, no. I prefer to wait and hope for better things.’ His<br> eyes sought her lips and lingered there a moment. ‘But how good of<br> you to come to see me, Scarlett! You are the first respectable<br> citizen who has called on me since my incarceration, and being in<br> jail makes one appreciate friends. When did you come to town?’<br><br> ‘Yesterday afternoon.’<br><br> ‘And you came out this morning? Why, my dear, you are more than<br> good.’ He smiled down at her with the first expression of honest<br> pleasure she had ever seen on his face. Scarlett smiled inwardly<br> with excitement and ducked her head as if embarrassed.<br><br> ‘Of course, I came out right away. Aunt Pitty told me about you<br> last night and I--I just couldn't sleep all night for thinking how<br> awful it was. Rhett, I'm so distressed!’<br><br> ‘Why, Scarlett!’<br><br> His voice was soft but there was a vibrant note in it, and looking<br> up into his dark face she saw in it none of the skepticism, the<br> jeering humor she knew so well. Before his direct gaze her eyes<br> fell again in real confusion. Things were going even better than<br> she hoped.<br><br> ‘It's worth being in jail to see you again and to hear you say<br> things like that. I really couldn't believe my ears when they<br> brought me your name. You see, I never expected you to forgive me<br> for my patriotic conduct that night on the road near Rough and<br> Ready. But I take it that this call means you have forgiven me?’<br><br> She could feel swift anger stir, even at this late date, as she<br> thought of that night but she subdued it and tossed her head until<br> the earrings danced.<br><br> ‘No, I haven't forgiven you,’ she said and pouted.<br><br> ‘Another hope crushed. And after I offered up myself for my<br> country and fought barefooted in the snow at Franklin and got the<br> finest case of dysentery you ever heard of for my pains!’<br><br> ‘I don't want to hear about your--pains,’ she said, still pouting<br> but smiling at him from up-tilted eyes. ‘I still think you were<br> hateful that night and I never expect to forgive you. Leaving me<br> alone like that when anything might have happened to me!’<br><br> ‘But nothing did happen to you. So, you see, my confidence in you<br> was justified. I knew you'd get home safely and God help any<br> Yankee who got in your way!’<br><br> ‘Rhett, why on earth did you do such a silly thing--enlisting at<br> the last minute when you knew we were going to get licked? And<br> after all you'd said about idiots who went out and got shot!’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, spare me! I am always overcome with shame when I think<br> about it.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'm glad to learn you are ashamed of the way you treated<br> me.’<br><br> ‘You misunderstand. I regret to say that my conscience has not<br> troubled me at all about deserting you. But as for enlisting--when<br> I think of joining the army in varnished boots and a white linen<br> suit and armed with only a pair of dueling pistols-- And those<br> long cold miles in the snow after my boots wore out and I had no<br> overcoat and nothing to eat . . . I cannot understand why I did not<br> desert. It was all the purest insanity. But it's in one's blood.<br> Southerners can never resist a losing cause. But never mind my<br> reasons. It's enough that I'm forgiven.’<br><br> ‘You're not. I think you're a hound.’ But she caressed the last<br> word until it might have been ‘darling.’<br><br> ‘Don't fib. You've forgiven me. Young ladies don't dare Yankee<br> sentries to see a prisoner, just for charity's sweet sake, and<br> come all dressed up in velvet and feathers and seal muffs too.<br> Scarlett, how pretty you look! Thank God, you aren't in rags or<br> mourning! I get so sick of women in dowdy old clothes and<br> perpetual crepe. You look like the Rue de la Paix. Turn around,<br> my dear, and let me look at you.’<br><br> So he had noticed the dress. Of course, he would notice such<br> things, being Rhett. She laughed in soft excitement and spun about<br> on her toes, her arms extended, her hoops tilting up to show her<br> lace trimmed pantalets. His black eyes took her in from bonnet to<br> heels in a glance that missed nothing, that old impudent unclothing<br> glance which always gave her goose bumps.<br><br> ‘You look very prosperous and very, very tidy. And almost good<br> enough to eat. If it wasn't for the Yankees outside--but you are<br> quite safe, my dear. Sit down. I won't take advantage of you as I<br> did the last time I saw you.’ He rubbed his cheek with pseudo<br> ruefulness. ‘Honestly, Scarlett, don't you think you were a bit<br> selfish that night? Think of all I had done for you, risked my<br> life--stolen a horse--and such a horse! Rushed to the defense of<br> Our Glorious Cause! And what did I get for my pains? Some hard<br> words and a very hard slap in the face.’<br><br> She sat down. The conversation was not going in quite the<br> direction she hoped. He had seemed so nice when he first saw her,<br> so genuinely glad she had come. He had almost seemed like a human<br> being and not the perverse wretch she knew so well.<br><br> ‘Must you always get something for your pains?’<br><br> ‘Why, of course! I am a monster of selfishness, as you ought to<br> know. I always expect payment for anything I give.’<br><br> That sent a slight chill through her but she rallied and jingled<br> her earbobs again.<br><br> ‘Oh, you really aren't so bad, Rhett. You just like to show off.’<br><br> ‘My word, but you have changed!’ he said and laughed. ‘What has<br> made a Christian of you? I have kept up with you through Miss<br> Pittypat but she gave me no intimation that you had developed<br> womanly sweetness. Tell me more about yourself, Scarlett. What<br> have you been doing since I last saw you?’<br><br> The old irritation and antagonism which he roused in her was hot in<br> her heart and she yearned to speak tart words. But she smiled<br> instead and the dimple crept into her cheek. He had drawn a chair<br> close beside hers and she leaned over and put a gentle hand on his<br> arm, in an unconscious manner.<br><br> ‘Oh, I've been doing nicely, thank you, and everything at Tara is<br> fine now. Of course, we had a dreadful time right after Sherman<br> went through but, after all, he didn't burn the house and the<br> darkies saved most of the livestock by driving it into the swamp.<br> And we cleared a fair crop this last fall, twenty bales. Of<br> course, that's practically nothing compared with what Tara can do<br> but we haven't many field hands. Pa says, of course, we'll do<br> better next year. But, Rhett, it's so dull in the country now!<br> Imagine, there aren't any balls or barbecues and the only thing<br> people talk about is hard times! Goodness, I get sick of it!<br> Finally last week I got too bored to stand it any longer, so Pa<br> said I must take a trip and have a good time. So I came up here to<br> get me some frocks made and then I'm going over to Charleston to<br> visit my aunt. It'll be lovely to go to balls again.’<br><br> There, she thought with pride, I delivered that with just the right<br> airy way! Not too rich but certainly not poor.<br><br> ‘You look beautiful in ball dresses, my dear, and you know it too,<br> worse luck! I suppose the real reason you are going visiting is<br> that you have run through the County swains and are seeking fresh<br> ones in fields afar.’<br><br> Scarlett had a thankful thought that Rhett had spent the last<br> several months abroad and had only recently come back to Atlanta.<br> Otherwise, he would never have made so ridiculous a statement. She<br> thought briefly of the County swains, the ragged embittered little<br> Fontaines, the poverty-stricken Munroe boys, the Jonesboro and<br> Fayetteville beaux who were so busy plowing, splitting rails and<br> nursing sick old animals that they had forgotten such things as<br> balls and pleasant flirtations ever existed. But she put down this<br> memory and giggled self-consciously as if admitting the truth of<br> his assertion.<br><br> ‘Oh, well,’ she said deprecatingly.<br><br> ‘You are a heartless creature, Scarlett, but perhaps that's part of<br> your charm.’ He smiled in his old way, one corner of his mouth<br> curving down, but she knew he was complimenting her. ‘For, of<br> course, you know you have more charm than the law should permit.<br> Even I have felt it, case-hardened though I am. I've often<br> wondered what it was about you that made me always remember you,<br> for I've known many ladies who were prettier than you and certainly<br> more clever and, I fear, morally more upright and kind. But,<br> somehow, I always remembered you. Even during the months since the<br> surrender when I was in France and England and hadn't seen you or<br> heard of you and was enjoying the society of many beautiful ladies,<br> I always remembered you and wondered what you were doing.’<br><br> For a moment she was indignant that he should say other women were<br> prettier, more clever and kind than she, but that momentary flare<br> was wiped out in her pleasure that he had remembered her and her<br> charm. So he hadn't forgotten! That would make things easier.<br> And he was behaving so nicely, almost like a gentleman would do<br> under the circumstances. Now, all she had to do was bring the<br> subject around to himself, so she could intimate that she had not<br> forgotten him either and then--<br><br> She gently squeezed his arm and dimpled again.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, how you do run on, teasing a country girl like me! I<br> know mighty well you never gave me a thought after you left me that<br> night. You can't tell me you ever thought of me with all those<br> pretty French and English girls around you. But I didn't come all<br> the way out here to hear you talk foolishness about me. I came--I<br> came--because--’<br><br> ‘Because?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, I'm so terribly distressed about you! So frightened<br> for you! When will they let you out of that terrible place?’<br><br> He swiftly covered her hand with his and held it hard against his<br> arm.<br><br> ‘Your distress does you credit. There's no telling when I'll be<br> out. Probably when they've stretched the rope a bit more.’<br><br> ‘The rope?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I expect to make my exit from here at the rope's end.’<br><br> ‘They won't really hang you?’<br><br> ‘They will if they can get a little more evidence against me.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett!’ she cried, her hand at her heart.<br><br> ‘Would you be sorry? If you are sorry enough, I'll mention you in<br> my will.’<br><br> His dark eyes laughed at her recklessly and he squeezed her hand.<br><br> His will! She hastily cast down her eyes for fear of betrayal but<br> not swiftly enough, for his eyes gleamed, suddenly curious.<br><br> ‘According to the Yankees, I ought to have a fine will. There<br> seems to be considerable interest in my finances at present. Every<br> day, I am hauled up before another board of inquiry and asked<br> foolish questions. The rumor seems current that I made off with<br> the mythical gold of the Confederacy.’<br><br> ‘Well--did you?’<br><br> ‘What a leading question! You know as well as I do that the<br> Confederacy ran a printing press instead of a mint.’<br><br> ‘Where did you get all your money? Speculating? Aunt Pittypat<br> said--’<br><br> ‘What probing questions you ask!’<br><br> Damn him! Of course, he had the money. She was so excited it<br> became difficult to talk sweetly to him.<br><br> ‘Rhett, I'm so upset about your being here. Don't you think<br> there's a chance of your getting out?’<br><br> ‘'Nihil desperandum' is my motto.’<br><br> ‘What does that mean?’<br><br> ‘It means 'maybe,' my charming ignoramus.’<br><br> She fluttered her thick lashes up to look at him and fluttered them<br> down again.<br><br> ‘Oh, you're too smart to let them hang you! I know you'll think of<br> some clever way to beat them and get out! And when you do--’<br><br> ‘And when I do?’ he asked softly, leaning closer.<br><br> ‘Well, I--’ and she managed a pretty confusion and a blush. The<br> blush was not difficult for she was breathless and her heart was<br> beating like a drum. ‘Rhett, I'm so sorry about what I--I said to<br> you that night--you know--at Rough and Ready. I was--oh, so very<br> frightened and upset and you were so--so--’ She looked down and<br> saw his brown hand tighten over hers. ‘And--I thought then that<br> I'd never, never forgive you! But when Aunt Pitty told me<br> yesterday that you--that they might hang you--it came over me of a<br> sudden and I--I--’ She looked up into his eyes with one swift<br> imploring glance and in it she put an agony of heartbreak. ‘Oh,<br> Rhett, I'd die if they hanged you! I couldn't bear it! You see,<br> I--’ And, because she could not longer sustain the hot leaping<br> light that was in his eyes, her lids fluttered down again.<br><br> In a moment I'll be crying, she thought in a frenzy of wonder and<br> excitement. Shall I let myself cry? Would that seem more natural?<br><br> He said quickly: ‘My God, Scarlett, you can't mean that you--’ and<br> his hands closed over hers in so hard a grip that it hurt.<br><br> She shut her eyes tightly, trying to squeeze out tears, but<br> remembered to turn her face up slightly so he could kiss her with<br> no difficulty. Now, in an instant his lips would be upon hers, the<br> hard insistent lips which she suddenly remembered with a vividness<br> that left her weak. But he did not kiss her. Disappointment<br> queerly stirring her, she opened her eyes a trifle and ventured a<br> peep at him. His black head was bent over her hands and, as she<br> watched, he lifted one and kissed it and, taking the other, laid it<br> against his cheek for a moment. Expecting violence, this gentle<br> and loverlike gesture startled her. She wondered what expression<br> was on his face but could not tell for his head was bowed.<br><br> She quickly lowered her gaze lest he should look up suddenly and<br> see the expression on her face. She knew that the feeling of<br> triumph surging through her was certain to be plain in her eyes.<br> In a moment he would ask her to marry him--or at least say that he<br> loved her and then . . . As she watched him through the veil of<br> her lashes he turned her hand over, palm up, to kiss it too, and<br> suddenly he drew a quick breath. Looking down she saw her own<br> palm, saw it as it really was for the first time in a year, and a<br> cold sinking fear gripped her. This was a stranger's palm, not<br> Scarlett O'Hara's soft, white, dimpled, helpless one. This hand<br> was rough from work, brown with sunburn, splotched with freckles.<br> The nails were broken and irregular, there were heavy calluses on<br> the cushions of the palm, a half-healed blister on the thumb. The<br> red scar which boiling fat had left last month was ugly and<br> glaring. She looked at it in horror and, before she thought, she<br> swiftly clenched her fist.<br><br> Still he did not raise his head. Still she could not see his face.<br> He pried her fist open inexorably and stared at it, picked up her<br> other hand and held them both together silently, looking down at<br> them.<br><br> ‘Look at me,’ he said finally raising his head, and his voice was<br> very quiet. ‘And drop that demure expression.’<br><br> Unwillingly she met his eyes, defiance and perturbation on her<br> face. His black brows were up and his eyes gleamed.<br><br> ‘So you have been doing very nicely at Tara, have you? Cleared so<br> much money on the cotton you can go visiting. What have you been<br> doing with your hands--plowing?’<br><br> She tried to wrench them away but he held them hard, running his<br> thumbs over the calluses.<br><br> ‘These are not the hands of a lady,’ he said and tossed them into<br> her lap.<br><br> ‘Oh, shut up!’ she cried, feeling a momentary intense relief at<br> being able to speak her feelings. ‘Whose business is it what I do<br> with my hands?’<br><br> What a fool I am, she thought vehemently. I should have borrowed<br> or stolen Aunt Pitty's gloves. But I didn't realize my hands<br> looked so bad. Of course, he would notice them. And now I've lost<br> my temper and probably ruined everything. Oh, to have this happen<br> when he was right at the point of a declaration!<br><br> ‘Your hands are certainly no business of mine,’ said Rhett coolly<br> and lounged back in his chair indolently, his face a smooth blank.<br><br> So he was going to be difficult. Well, she'd have to bear it<br> meekly, much as she disliked it, if she expected to snatch victory<br> from this debacle. Perhaps if she sweet-talked him--<br><br> ‘I think you're real rude to throw off on my poor hands. Just<br> because I went riding last week without my gloves and ruined them--’<br><br> ‘Riding, hell!’ he said in the same level voice. ‘You've been<br> working with those hands, working like a nigger. What's the<br> answer? Why did you lie to me about everything being nice at<br> Tara?’<br><br> ‘Now, Rhett--’<br><br> ‘Suppose we get down to the truth. What is the real purpose of<br> your visit? Almost, I was persuaded by your coquettish airs that<br> you cared something about me and were sorry for me.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I am sorry! Indeed--’<br><br> ‘No, you aren't. They can hang me higher than Haman for all you<br> care. It's written as plainly on your face as hard work is written<br> on your hands. You wanted something from me and you wanted it<br> badly enough to put on quite a show. Why didn't you come out in<br> the open and tell me what it was? You'd have stood a much better<br> chance of getting it, for if there's one virtue I value in women<br> it's frankness. But no, you had to come jingling your earbobs and<br> pouting and frisking like a prostitute with a prospective client.’<br><br> He did not raise his voice at the last words or emphasize them in<br> any way but to Scarlett they cracked like a whiplash, and with<br> despair she saw the end of her hopes of getting him to propose<br> marriage. Had he exploded with rage and injured vanity or<br> upbraided her, as other men would have done, she could have handled<br> him. But the deadly quietness of his voice frightened her, left<br> her utterly at a loss as to her next move. Although he was a<br> prisoner and the Yankees were in the next room, it came to her<br> suddenly that Rhett Butler was a dangerous man to run afoul of.<br><br> ‘I suppose my memory is getting faulty. I should have recalled<br> that you are just like me and that you never do anything without an<br> ulterior motive. Now, let me see. What could you have had up your<br> sleeve, Mrs. Hamilton? It isn't possible that you were so<br> misguided as to think I would propose matrimony?’<br><br> Her face went crimson and she did not answer.<br><br> ‘But you can't have forgotten my oft-repeated remark that I am not<br> a marrying man?’<br><br> When she did not speak, he said with sudden violence:<br><br> ‘You hadn't forgotten? Answer me.’<br><br> ‘I hadn't forgotten,’ she said wretchedly.<br><br> ‘What a gambler you are, Scarlett,’ he jeered. ‘You took a chance<br> that my incarceration away from female companionship would put me<br> in such a state I'd snap at you like a trout at a worm.’<br><br> And that's what you did, thought Scarlett with inward rage, and if<br> it hadn't been for my hands--<br><br> ‘Now, we have most of the truth, everything except your reason.<br> See if you can tell me the truth about why you wanted to lead me<br> into wedlock.’<br><br> There was a suave, almost teasing note in his voice and she took<br> heart. Perhaps everything wasn't lost, after all. Of course, she<br> had ruined any hope of marriage but, even in her despair, she was<br> glad. There was something about this immobile man which frightened<br> her, so that now the thought of marrying him was fearful. But<br> perhaps if she was clever and played on his sympathies and his<br> memories, she could secure a loan. She pulled her face into a<br> placating and childlike expression.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, you can help me so much--if you'll just be sweet.’<br><br> ‘There's nothing I like better than being--sweet.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, for old friendship's sake, I want you to do me a favor.’<br><br> ‘So, at last the horny-handed lady comes to her real mission. I<br> feared that 'visiting the sick and the imprisoned' was not your<br> proper role. What do you want? Money?’<br><br> The bluntness of his question ruined all hopes of leading up to the<br> matter in any circuitous and sentimental way.<br><br> ‘Don't be mean, Rhett,’ she coaxed. ‘I do want some money. I want<br> you to lend me three hundred dollars.’<br><br> ‘The truth at last. Talking love and thinking money. How truly<br> feminine! Do you need the money badly?’<br><br> ‘Oh, ye-- Well, not so terribly but I could use it.’<br><br> ‘Three hundred dollars. That's a vast amount of money. What do<br> you want it for?’<br><br> ‘To pay taxes on Tara.’<br><br> ‘So you want to borrow some money. Well, since you're so<br> businesslike, I'll be businesslike too. What collateral will you<br> give me?’<br><br> ‘What what?’<br><br> ‘Collateral. Security on my investment. Of course, I don't want<br> to lose all that money.’ His voice was deceptively smooth, almost<br> silky, but she did not notice. Maybe everything would turn out<br> nicely after all.<br><br> ‘My earrings.’<br><br> ‘I'm not interested in earrings.’<br><br> ‘I'll give you a mortgage on Tara.’<br><br> ‘Now just what would I do with a farm?’<br><br> ‘Well, you could--you could--it's a good plantation. And you<br> wouldn't lose. I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.’<br><br> ‘I'm not so sure.’ He tilted back in his chair and stuck his hands<br> in his pockets. ‘Cotton prices are dropping. Times are so hard<br> and money's so tight.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, you are teasing me! You know you have millions!’<br><br> There was a warm dancing malice in his eyes as he surveyed her.<br><br> ‘So everything is going nicely and you don't need the money very<br> badly. Well, I'm glad to hear that. I like to know that all is<br> well with old friends.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, for God's sake . . .’ she began desperately, her<br> courage and control breaking.<br><br> ‘Do lower your voice. You don't want the Yankees to hear you, I<br> hope. Did anyone ever tell you you had eyes like a cat--a cat in<br> the dark?’<br><br> ‘Rhett, don't! I'll tell you everything. I do need the money so<br> badly. I--I lied about everything being all right. Everything's<br> as wrong as it could be. Father is--is--he's not himself. He's<br> been queer ever since Mother died and he can't help me any. He's<br> just like a child. And we haven't a single field hand to work the<br> cotton and there's so many to feed, thirteen of us. And the taxes--<br> they are so high. Rhett, I'll tell you everything. For over a<br> year we've been just this side of starvation. Oh, you don't know!<br> You can't know! We've never had enough to eat and it's terrible to<br> wake up hungry and go to sleep hungry. And we haven't any warm<br> clothes and the children are always cold and sick and--’<br><br> ‘Where did you get the pretty dress?’<br><br> ‘It's made out of Mother's curtains,’ she answered, too desperate<br> to lie about this shame. ‘I could stand being hungry and cold but<br> now--now the Carpetbaggers have raised our taxes. And the money's<br> got to be paid right away. And I haven't any money except one<br> five-dollar gold piece. I've got to have money for the taxes!<br> Don't you see? If I don't pay them, I'll--we'll lose Tara and we<br> just can't lose it! I can't let it go!’<br><br> ‘Why didn't you tell me all this at first instead of preying on my<br> susceptible heart--always weak where pretty ladies are concerned?<br> No, Scarlett, don't cry. You've tried every trick except that one<br> and I don't think I could stand it. My feelings are already<br> lacerated with disappointment at discovering it was my money and<br> not my charming self you wanted.’<br><br> She remembered that he frequently told bald truths about himself<br> when he spoke mockingly--mocking himself as well as others, and she<br> hastily looked up at him. Were his feelings really hurt? Did he<br> really care about her? Had he been on the verge of a proposal when<br> he saw her palms? Or had he only been leading up to another such<br> odious proposal as he had made twice before? If he really cared<br> about her, perhaps she could smooth him down. But his black eyes<br> raked her in no lover-like way and he was laughing softly.<br><br> ‘I don't like your collateral. I'm no planter. What else have you<br> to offer?’<br><br> Well, she had come to it at last. Now for it! She drew a deep<br> breath and met his eyes squarely, all coquetry and airs gone as her<br> spirit rushed out to grapple that which she feared most.<br><br> ‘I--I have myself.’<br><br> ‘Yes?’<br><br> Her jaw line tightened to squareness and her eyes went emerald.<br><br> ‘You remember that night on Aunt Pitty's porch, during the siege?<br> You said--you said then that you wanted me.’<br><br> He leaned back carelessly in his chair and looked into her tense<br> face and his own dark face was inscrutable. Something flickered<br> behind his eyes but he said nothing.<br><br> ‘You said--you said you'd never wanted a woman as much as you<br> wanted me. If you still want me, you can have me. Rhett, I'll do<br> anything you say but, for God's sake, write me a draft for the<br> money! My word's good. I swear it. I won't go back on it. I'll<br> put it in writing if you like.’<br><br> He looked at her oddly, still inscrutable and as she hurried on she<br> could not tell if he were amused or repelled. If he would only say<br> something, anything! She felt her cheeks getting hot.<br><br> ‘I have got to have the money soon, Rhett. They'll turn us out in<br> the road and that damned overseer of Father's will own the place<br> and--’<br><br> ‘Just a minute. What makes you think I still want you? What makes<br> you think you are worth three hundred dollars? Most women don't<br> come that high.’<br><br> She blushed to her hair line and her humiliation was complete.<br><br> ‘Why are you doing this? Why not let the farm go and live at Miss<br> Pittypat's. You own half that house.’<br><br> ‘Name of God!’ she cried. ‘Are you a fool? I can't let Tara go.<br> It's home. I won't let it go. Not while I've got breath left in<br> me!’<br><br> ‘The Irish,’ said he, lowering his chair back to level and removing<br> his hands from his pockets, ‘are the damnedest race. They put so<br> much emphasis on so many wrong things. Land, for instance. And<br> every bit of earth is just like every other bit. Now, let me get<br> this straight, Scarlett. You are coming to me with a business<br> proposition. I'll give you three hundred dollars and you'll become<br> my mistress.’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> Now that the repulsive word had been said, she felt somehow easier<br> and hope awoke in her again. He had said ‘I'll give you.’ There<br> was a diabolic gleam in his eyes as if something amused him<br> greatly.<br><br> ‘And yet, when I had the effrontery to make you this same<br> proposition, you turned me out of the house. And also you called<br> me a number of very hard names and mentioned in passing that you<br> didn't want a 'passel of brats.' No, my dear, I'm not rubbing it<br> in. I'm only wondering at the peculiarities of your mind. You<br> wouldn't do it for your own pleasure but you will to keep the wolf<br> away from the door. It proves my point that all virtue is merely a<br> matter of prices.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, how you run on! If you want to insult me, go on and do<br> it but give me the money.’<br><br> She was breathing easier now. Being what he was, Rhett would<br> naturally want to torment and insult her as much as possible to pay<br> her back for past slights and for her recent attempted trickery.<br> Well, she could stand it. She could stand anything. Tara was<br> worth it all. For a brief moment it was mid-summer and the<br> afternoon skies were blue and she lay drowsily in the thick clover<br> of Tara's lawn, looking up at the billowing cloud castles, the<br> fragrance of white blossoms in her nose and the pleasant busy<br> humming of bees in her ears. Afternoon and hush and the far-off<br> sound of the wagons coming in from the spiraling red fields. Worth<br> it all, worth more.<br><br> Her head went up.<br><br> ‘Are you going to give me the money?’<br><br> He looked as if he were enjoying himself and when he spoke there<br> was suave brutality in his voice.<br><br> ‘No, I'm not,’ he said.<br><br> For a moment her mind could not adjust itself to his words.<br><br> ‘I couldn't give it to you, even if I wanted to. I haven't a cent<br> on me. Not a dollar in Atlanta. I have some money, yes, but not<br> here. And I'm not saying where it is or how much. But if I tried<br> to draw a draft on it, the Yankees would be on me like a duck on a<br> June bug and then neither of us would get it. What do you think of<br> that?’<br><br> Her face went an ugly green, freckles suddenly standing out across<br> her nose and her contorted mouth was like Gerald's in a killing<br> rage. She sprang to her feet with an incoherent cry which made the<br> hum of voices in the next room cease suddenly. Swift as a panther,<br> Rhett was beside her, his heavy hand across her mouth, his arm<br> tight about her waist. She struggled against him madly, trying to<br> bite his hand, to kick his legs, to scream her rage, despair, hate,<br> her agony of broken pride. She bent and twisted every way against<br> the iron of his arm, her heart near bursting, her tight stays<br> cutting off her breath. He held her so tightly, so roughly that it<br> hurt and the hand over her mouth pinched into her jaws cruelly.<br> His face was white under its tan, his eyes hard and anxious as he<br> lifted her completely off her feet, swung her up against his chest<br> and sat down in the chair, holding her writhing in his lap.<br><br> ‘Darling, for God's sake! Stop! Hush! Don't yell. They'll be in<br> here in a minute if you do. Do calm yourself. Do you want the<br> Yankees to see you like this?’<br><br> She was beyond caring who saw her, beyond anything except a fiery<br> desire to kill him, but dizziness was sweeping her. She could not<br> breathe; he was choking her; her stays were like a swiftly<br> compressing band of iron; his arms about her made her shake with<br> helpless hate and fury. Then his voice became thin and dim and his<br> face above her swirled in a sickening mist which became heavier and<br> heavier until she no longer saw him--or anything else.<br><br> When she made feeble swimming motions to come back to consciousness,<br> she was tired to her bones, weak, bewildered. She was lying back in<br> the chair, her bonnet off, Rhett was slapping her wrist, his black<br> eyes searching her face anxiously. The nice young captain was<br> trying to pour a glass of brandy into her mouth and had spilled it<br> down her neck. The other officers hovered helplessly about,<br> whispering and waving their hands.<br><br> ‘I--guess I must have fainted,’ she said, and her voice sounded so<br> far away it frightened her.<br><br> ‘Drink this,’ said Rhett, taking the glass and pushing it against<br> her lips. Now she remembered and glared feebly at him but she was<br> too tired for anger.<br><br> ‘Please, for my sake.’<br><br> She gulped and choked and began coughing but he pushed it to her<br> mouth again. She swallowed deeply and the hot liquid burned<br> suddenly in her throat.<br><br> ‘I think she's better now, gentlemen,’ said Rhett, ‘and I thank you<br> very much. The realization that I'm to be executed was too much<br> for her.’<br><br> The group in blue shuffled their feet and looked embarrassed and<br> after several clearings of throats, they tramped out. The young<br> captain paused in the doorway.<br><br> ‘If there's anything more I can do--’<br><br> ‘No, thank you.’<br><br> He went out, closing the door behind him.<br><br> ‘Drink some more,’ said Rhett.<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Drink it.’<br><br> She swallowed another mouthful and the warmth began spreading<br> through her body and strength flowed slowly back into her shaking<br> legs. She pushed away the glass and tried to rise but he pressed<br> her back.<br><br> ‘Take your hands off me. I'm going.’<br><br> ‘Not yet. Wait a minute. You might faint again.’<br><br> ‘I'd rather faint in the road than be here with you.’<br><br> ‘Just the same, I won't have you fainting in the road.’<br><br> ‘Let me go. I hate you.’<br><br> A faint smile came back to his face at her words.<br><br> ‘That sounds more like you. You must be feeling better.’<br><br> She lay relaxed for a moment, trying to summon anger to her aid,<br> trying to draw on her strength. But she was too tired. She was<br> too tired to hate or to care very much about anything. Defeat lay<br> on her spirit like lead. She had gambled everything and lost<br> everything. Not even pride was left. This was the dead end of her<br> last hope. This was the end of Tara, the end of them all. For a<br> long time she lay back with her eyes closed, hearing his heavy<br> breathing near her, and the glow of the brandy crept gradually over<br> her, giving a false strength and warmth. When finally she opened<br> her eyes and looked him in the face, anger had roused again. As<br> her slanting eyebrows rushed down together in a frown Rhett's old<br> smile came back.<br><br> ‘Now you are better. I can tell it by your scowl.’<br><br> ‘Of course, I'm all right. Rhett Butler, you are hateful, a skunk,<br> if ever I saw one! You knew very well what I was going to say as<br> soon as I started talking and you knew you weren't going to give me<br> the money. And yet you let me go right on. You could have spared<br> me--’<br><br> ‘Spared you and missed hearing all that? Not much. I have so few<br> diversions here. I don't know when I've ever heard anything so<br> gratifying.’ He laughed his sudden mocking laugh. At the sound<br> she leaped to her feet, snatching up her bonnet.<br><br> He suddenly had her by the shoulders.<br><br> ‘Not quite yet. Do you feel well enough to talk sense?’<br><br> ‘Let me go!’<br><br> ‘You are well enough, I see. Then, tell me this. Was I the only<br> iron you had in the fire?’ His eyes were keen and alert, watching<br> every change in her face.<br><br> ‘What do you mean?’<br><br> ‘Was I the only man you were going to try this on?’<br><br> ‘Is that any of your business?’<br><br> ‘More than you realize. Are there any other men on your string?<br> Tell me!’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Incredible. I can't imagine you without five or six in reserve.<br> Surely someone will turn up to accept your interesting proposition.<br> I feel so sure of it that I want to give you a little advice.’<br><br> ‘I don't want your advice.’<br><br> ‘Nevertheless I will give it. Advice seems to be the only thing I<br> can give you at present. Listen to it, for it's good advice. When<br> you are trying to get something out of a man, don't blurt it out as<br> you did to me. Do try to be more subtle, more seductive. It gets<br> better results. You used to know how, to perfection. But just now<br> when you offered me your--er--collateral for my money you looked as<br> hard as nails. I've seen eyes like yours above a dueling pistol<br> twenty paces from me and they aren't a pleasant sight. They evoke<br> no ardor in the male breast. That's no way to handle men, my dear.<br> You are forgetting your early training.’<br><br> ‘I don't need you to tell me how to behave,’ she said and wearily<br> put on her bonnet. She wondered how he could jest so blithely with<br> a rope about his neck and her pitiful circumstances before him.<br> She did not even notice that his hands were jammed in his pockets<br> in hard fists as if he were straining at his own impotence.<br><br> ‘Cheer up,’ he said, as she tied the bonnet strings. ‘You can come<br> to my hanging and it will make you feel lots better. It'll even up<br> all your old scores with me--even this one. And I'll mention you<br> in my will.’<br><br> ‘Thank you, but they may not hang you till it's too late to pay the<br> taxes,’ she said with a sudden malice that matched his own, and she<br> meant it.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXV<br><br> <br> It was raining when she came out of the building and the sky was a<br> dull putty color. The soldiers on the square had taken shelter in<br> their huts and the streets were deserted. There was no vehicle in<br> sight and she knew she would have to walk the long way home.<br><br> The brandy glow faded as she trudged along. The cold wind made her<br> shiver and the chilly needle-like drops drove hard into her face.<br> The rain quickly penetrated Aunt Pitty's thin cloak until it hung<br> in clammy folds about her. She knew the velvet dress was being<br> ruined and as for the tail feathers on the bonnet, they were as<br> drooping and draggled as when their former owner had worn them<br> about the wet barn yard of Tara. The bricks of the sidewalk were<br> broken and, for long stretches, completely gone. In these spots<br> the mud was ankle deep and her slippers stuck in it as if it were<br> glue, even coming completely off her feet. Every time she bent<br> over to retrieve them, the hem of the dress fell in the mud. She<br> did not even try to avoid puddles but stepped dully into them,<br> dragging her heavy skirts after her. She could feel her wet<br> petticoat and pantalets cold about her ankles, but she was beyond<br> caring about the wreck of the costume on which she had gambled so<br> much. She was chilled and disheartened and desperate.<br><br> How could she ever go back to Tara and face them after her brave<br> words? How could she tell them they must all go--somewhere? How<br> could she leave it all, the red fields, the tall pines, the dark<br> swampy bottom lands, the quiet burying ground where Ellen lay in<br> the cedars' deep shade?<br><br> Hatred of Rhett burned in her heart as she plodded along the<br> slippery way. What a blackguard he was! She hoped they did hang<br> him, so she would never have to face him again with his knowledge<br> of her disgrace and her humiliation. Of course, he could have<br> gotten the money for her if he'd wanted to get it. Oh, hanging was<br> too good for him! Thank God, he couldn't see her now, with her<br> clothes soaking wet and her hair straggling and her teeth<br> chattering. How hideous she must look and how he would laugh!<br><br> The negroes she passed turned insolent grins at her and laughed<br> among themselves as she hurried by, slipping and sliding in the<br> mud, stopping, panting to replace her slippers. How dared they<br> laugh, the black apes! How dared they grin at her, Scarlett O'Hara<br> of Tara! She'd like to have them all whipped until the blood ran<br> down their backs. What devils the Yankees were to set them free,<br> free to jeer at white people!<br><br> As she walked down Washington Street, the landscape was as dreary<br> as her own heart. Here there was none of the bustle and<br> cheerfulness which she had noted on Peachtree Street. Here many<br> handsome homes had once stood, but few of them had been rebuilt.<br> Smoked foundations and the lonesone blackened chimneys, now known<br> as ‘Sherman's Sentinels,’ appeared with disheartening frequency.<br> Overgrown paths led to what had been houses--old lawns thick with<br> dead weeds, carriage blocks bearing names she knew so well,<br> hitching posts which would never again know the knot of reins.<br> Cold wind and rain, mud and bare trees, silence and desolation.<br> How wet her feet were and how long the journey home!<br><br> She heard the splash of hooves behind her and moved farther over on<br> the narrow sidewalk to avoid more mud splotches on Aunt Pittypat's<br> cloak. A horse and buggy came slowly up the road and she turned to<br> watch it, determined to beg a ride if the driver was a white<br> person. The rain obscured her vision as the buggy came abreast,<br> but she saw the driver peer over the tarpaulin that stretched from<br> the dashboard to his chin. There was something familiar about his<br> face and as she stepped out into the road to get a closer view,<br> there was an embarrassed little cough from the man and a well-known<br> voice cried in accents of pleasure and astonishment: ‘Surely, it<br> can't be Miss Scarlett!’<br><br> ‘Oh, Mr. Kennedy!’ she cried, splashing across the road and leaning<br> on the muddy wheel, heedless of further damage to the cloak. ‘I<br> was never so glad to see anybody in my life!’<br><br> He colored with pleasure at the obvious sincerity of her words,<br> hastily squirted a stream of tobacco juice from the opposite side<br> of the buggy and leaped spryly to the ground. He shook her hand<br> enthusiastically and holding up the tarpaulin, assisted her into<br> the buggy.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, what are you doing over in this section by<br> yourself? Don't you know it's dangerous these days? And you are<br> soaking wet. Here, wrap the robe around your feet.’<br><br> As he fussed over her, clucking like a hen, she gave herself up to<br> the luxury of being taken care of. It was nice to have a man<br> fussing and clucking and scolding, even if it was only that old<br> maid in pants, Frank Kennedy. It was especially soothing after<br> Rhett's brutal treatment. And oh, how good to see a County face<br> when she was so far from home! He was well dressed, she noticed,<br> and the buggy was new too. The horse looked young and well fed,<br> but Frank looked far older than his years, older than on that<br> Christmas eve when he had been at Tara with his men. He was thin<br> and sallow faced and his yellow eyes were watery and sunken in<br> creases of loose flesh. His ginger-colored beard was scantier than<br> ever, streaked with tobacco juice and as ragged as if he clawed at<br> it incessantly. But he looked bright and cheerful, in contrast<br> with the lines of sorrow and worry and weariness which Scarlett saw<br> in faces everywhere.<br><br> ‘It's a pleasure to see you,’ said Frank warmly. ‘I didn't know<br> you were in town. I saw Miss Pittypat only last week and she<br> didn't tell me you were coming. Did--er--ahem--did anyone else<br> come up from Tara with you?’<br><br> He was thinking of Suellen, the silly old fool.<br><br> ‘No,’ she said, wrapping the warm lap robe about her and trying to<br> pull it up around her neck. ‘I came alone. I didn't give Aunt<br> Pitty any warning.’<br><br> He chirruped to the horse and it plodded off, picking its way<br> carefully down the slick road.<br><br> ‘All the folks at Tara well?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, so-so.’<br><br> She must think of something to talk about, yet it was so hard to<br> talk. Her mind was leaden with defeat and all she wanted was to<br> lie back in this warm blanket and say to herself: ‘I won't think<br> of Tara now. I'll think of it later, when it won't hurt so much.’<br> If she could just get him started talking on some subject which<br> would hold him all the way home, so she would have nothing to do<br> but murmur ‘How nice’ and ‘You certainly are smart’ at intervals.<br><br> ‘Mr. Kennedy, I'm so surprised to see you. I know I've been a bad<br> girl, not keeping up with old friends, but I didn't know you were<br> here in Atlanta. I thought somebody told me you were in Marietta.’<br><br> ‘I do business in Marietta, a lot of business,’ he said. ‘Didn't<br> Miss Suellen tell you I had settled in Atlanta? Didn't she tell<br> you about my store?’<br><br> Vaguely she had a memory of Suellen chattering about Frank and a<br> store but she never paid much heed to anything Suellen said. It<br> had been sufficient to know that Frank was alive and would some day<br> take Suellen off her hands.<br><br> ‘No, not a word,’ she lied. ‘Have you a store? How smart you must<br> be!’<br><br> He looked a little hurt at hearing that Suellen had not published<br> the news but brightened at the flattery.<br><br> ‘Yes, I've got a store, and a pretty good one I think. Folks tell<br> me I'm a born merchant.’<br><br> He laughed pleasedly, the tittery cackling laugh which she always<br> found so annoying.<br><br> Conceited old fool, she thought.<br><br> ‘Oh, you could be a success at anything you turned your hand to,<br> Mr. Kennedy. But how on earth did you ever get started with the<br> store? When I saw you Christmas before last you said you didn't<br> have a cent in the world.’<br><br> He cleared his throat raspingly, clawed at his whiskers and smiled<br> his nervous timid smile.<br><br> ‘Well, it's a long story, Miss Scarlett.’<br><br> Thank the Lord! she thought. Perhaps it will hold him till we get<br> home. And aloud: ‘Do tell!’<br><br> ‘You recall when we came to Tara last, hunting for supplies? Well,<br> not long after that I went into active service. I mean real<br> fighting. No more commissary for me. There wasn't much need for a<br> commissary, Miss Scarlett, because we couldn't hardly pick up a<br> thing for the army, and I thought the place for an able-bodied man<br> was in the fighting line. Well, I fought along with the cavalry<br> for a spell till I got a minie ball through the shoulder.’<br><br> He looked very proud and Scarlett said: ‘How dreadful!’<br><br> ‘Oh, it wasn't so bad, just a flesh wound,’ he said deprecatingly.<br> ‘I was sent down south to a hospital and when I was just about<br> well, the Yankee raiders came through. My, my, but that was a hot<br> time! We didn't have much warning and all of us who could walk<br> helped haul out the army stores and the hospital equipment to the<br> train tracks to move it. We'd gotten one train about loaded when<br> the Yankees rode in one end of town and out we went the other end<br> as fast as we could go. My, my, that was a mighty sad sight,<br> sitting on top of that train and seeing the Yankees burn those<br> supplies we had to leave at the depot. Miss Scarlett, they burned<br> about a half-mile of stuff we had piled up there along the tracks.<br> We just did get away ourselves.’<br><br> ‘How dreadful!’<br><br> ‘Yes, that's the word. Dreadful. Our men had come back into<br> Atlanta then and so our train was sent here. Well, Miss Scarlett,<br> it wasn't long before the war was over and--well, there was a lot<br> of china and cots and mattresses and blankets and nobody claiming<br> them. I suppose rightfully they belonged to the Yankees. I think<br> those were the terms of the surrender, weren't they?’<br><br> ‘Um,’ said Scarlett absently. She was getting warmer now and a<br> little drowsy.<br><br> ‘I don't know till now if I did right,’ he said, a little<br> querulously. ‘But the way I figured it, all that stuff wouldn't do<br> the Yankees a bit of good. They'd probably burn it. And our folks<br> had paid good solid money for it, and I thought it still ought to<br> belong to the Confederacy or to the Confederates. Do you see what<br> I mean?’<br><br> ‘Um.’<br><br> ‘I'm glad you agree with me, Miss Scarlett. In a way, it's been on<br> my conscience. Lots of folks have told me: 'Oh, forget about it,<br> Frank,' but I can't. I couldn't hold up my head if I thought I'd<br> done what wasn't right. Do you think I did right?’<br><br> ‘Of course,’ she said, wondering what the old fool had been talking<br> about. Some struggle with his conscience. When a man got as old<br> as Frank Kennedy he ought to have learned not to bother about<br> things that didn't matter. But he always was so nervous and fussy<br> and old maidish.<br><br> ‘I'm glad to hear you say it. After the surrender I had about ten<br> dollars in silver and nothing else in the world. You know what<br> they did to Jonesboro and my house and store there. I just didn't<br> know what to do. But I used the ten dollars to put a roof on an<br> old store down by Five Points and I moved the hospital equipment in<br> and started selling it. Everybody needed beds and china and<br> mattresses and I sold them cheap, because I figured it was about as<br> much other folks' stuff as it was mine. But I cleared money on it<br> and bought some more stuff and the store just went along fine. I<br> think I'll make a lot of money on it if things pick up.’<br><br> At the word ‘money,’ her mind came back to him, crystal clear.<br><br> ‘You say you've made money?’<br><br> He visibly expanded under her interest. Few women except Suellen<br> had ever given him more than perfunctory courtesy and it was very<br> flattering to have a former belle like Scarlett hanging on his<br> words. He slowed the horse so they would not reach home before he<br> had finished his story.<br><br> ‘I'm not a millionaire, Miss Scarlett, and considering the money I<br> used to have, what I've got now sounds small. But I made a<br> thousand dollars this year. Of course, five hundred of it went to<br> paying for new stock and repairing the store and paying the rent.<br> But I've made five hundred clear and as things are certainly<br> picking up, I ought to clear two thousand next year. I can sure<br> use it, too, for you see, I've got another iron in the fire.’<br><br> Interest had sprung up sharply in her at the talk of money. She<br> veiled her eyes with thick bristly lashes and moved a little closer<br> to him.<br><br> ‘What does that mean, Mr. Kennedy?’<br><br> He laughed and slapped the reins against the horse's back.<br><br> ‘I guess I'm boring you, talking about business, Miss Scarlett. A<br> pretty little woman like you doesn't need to know anything about<br> business.’<br><br> The old fool.<br><br> ‘Oh, I know I'm a goose about business but I'm so interested!<br> Please tell me all about it and you can explain what I don't<br> understand.’<br><br> ‘Well, my other iron is a sawmill.’<br><br> ‘A what?’<br><br> ‘A mill to cut up lumber and plane it. I haven't bought it yet but<br> I'm going to. There's a man named Johnson who has one, way out<br> Peachtree road, and he's anxious to sell it. He needs some cash<br> right away, so he wants to sell and stay and run it for me at a<br> weekly wage. It's one of the few mills in this section, Miss<br> Scarlett. The Yankees destroyed most of them. And anyone who owns<br> a sawmill owns a gold mine, for nowadays you can ask your own price<br> for lumber. The Yankees burned so many houses here and there<br> aren't enough for people to live in and it looks like folks have<br> gone crazy about rebuilding. They can t get enough lumber and they<br> can't get it fast enough. People are just pouring into Atlanta<br> now, all the folks from the country districts who can't make a go<br> of farming without darkies and the Yankees and Carpetbaggers who<br> are swarming in trying to pick our bones a little barer than they<br> already are. I tell you Atlanta's going to be a big town soon.<br> They've got to have lumber for their houses, so I'm going to buy<br> this mill just as soon as--well, as soon as some of the bills owing<br> me are paid. By this time next year, I ought to be breathing<br> easier about money. I--I guess you know why I'm so anxious to make<br> money quickly, don't you?’<br><br> He blushed and cackled again. He's thinking of Suellen, Scarlett<br> thought in disgust.<br><br> For a moment she considered asking him to lend her three hundred<br> dollars, but wearily she rejected the idea. He would be<br> embarrassed; he would stammer; he would offer excuses, but he<br> wouldn't lend it to her. He had worked hard for it, so he could<br> marry Suellen in the spring and if he parted with it, his wedding<br> would be postponed indefinitely. Even if she worked on his<br> sympathies and his duty toward his future family and gained his<br> promise of a loan, she knew Suellen would never permit it. Suellen<br> was getting more and more worried over the fact that she was<br> practically an old maid and she would move heaven and earth to<br> prevent anything from delaying her marriage.<br><br> What was there in that whining complaining girl to make this old<br> fool so anxious to give her a soft nest? Suellen didn't deserve a<br> loving husband and the profits of a store and a sawmill. The<br> minute Sue got her hands on a little money she'd give herself<br> unendurable airs and never contribute one cent toward the upkeep of<br> Tara. Not Suellen! She'd think herself well out of it and not<br> care if Tara went for taxes or burned to the ground, so long as she<br> had pretty clothes and a ‘Mrs.’ in front of her name.<br><br> As Scarlett thought of Suellen's secure future and the precarious<br> one of herself and Tara, anger flamed in her at the unfairness of<br> life. Hastily she looked out of the buggy into the muddy street,<br> lest Frank should see her expression. She was going to lose<br> everything she had, while Sue-- Suddenly a determination was born<br> in her.<br><br> Suellen should not have Frank and his store and his mill!<br><br> Suellen didn't deserve them. She was going to have them herself.<br> She thought of Tara and remembered Jonas Wilkerson, venomous as a<br> rattler, at the foot of the front steps, and she grasped at the<br> last straw floating above the shipwreck of her life. Rhett had<br> failed her but the Lord had provided Frank.<br><br> But can I get him? Her fingers clenched as she looked unseeingly<br> into the rain. Can I make him forget Sue and propose to me real<br> quick? If I could make Rhett almost propose, I know I could get<br> Frank! Her eyes went over him, her lids flickering. Certainly,<br> he's no beauty, she thought coolly, and he's got very bad teeth and<br> his breath smells bad and he's old enough to be my father.<br> Moreover, he's nervous and timid and well meaning, and I don't know<br> of any more damning qualities a man can have. But at least, he's a<br> gentleman and I believe I could stand living with him better than<br> with Rhett. Certainly I could manage him easier. At any rate,<br> beggars can't be choosers.<br><br> That he was Suellen's fiance caused her no qualm of conscience.<br> After the complete moral collapse which had sent her to Atlanta and<br> to Rhett, the appropriation of her sister's betrothed seemed a<br> minor affair and one not to be bothered with at this time.<br><br> With the rousing of fresh hope, her spine stiffened and she forgot<br> that her feet were wet and cold. She looked at Frank so steadily,<br> her eyes narrowing, that he became somewhat alarmed and she dropped<br> her gaze swiftly, remembering Rhett's words: ‘I've seen eyes like<br> yours above a dueling pistol. . . . They evoke no ardor in the<br> male breast.’<br><br> ‘What's the matter, Miss Scarlett? You got a chill?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ she answered helplessly. ‘Would you mind--’ She hesitated<br> timidly. ‘Would you mind if I put my hand in your coat pocket?<br> It's so cold and my muff is soaked through.’<br><br> ‘Why--why--of course not! And you haven't any gloves! My, my,<br> what a brute I've been idling along like this, talking my head off<br> when you must be freezing and wanting to get to a fire. Giddap,<br> Sally! By the way, Miss Scarlett, I've been so busy talking about<br> myself I haven't even asked you what you were doing in this section<br> in this weather?’<br><br> ‘I was at the Yankee headquarters,’ she answered before she<br> thought. His sandy brows went up in astonishment.<br><br> ‘But Miss Scarlett! The soldiers-- Why--’<br><br> ‘Mary, Mother of God, let me think of a real good lie,’ she prayed<br> hastily. It would never do for Frank to suspect she had seen<br> Rhett. Frank thought Rhett the blackest of blackguards and unsafe<br> for decent women to speak to.<br><br> ‘I went there--I went there to see if--if any of the officers would<br> buy fancy work from me to send home to their wives. I embroider<br> very nicely.’<br><br> He sank back against the seat aghast, indignation struggling with<br> bewilderment.<br><br> ‘You went to the Yankees-- But Miss Scarlett! You shouldn't.<br> Why--why . . . Surely your father doesn't know! Surely, Miss<br> Pittypat--’<br><br> ‘Oh, I shall die if you tell Aunt Pittypat!’ she cried in real<br> anxiety and burst into tears. It was easy to cry, because she was<br> so cold and miserable, but the effect was startling. Frank could<br> not have been more embarrassed or helpless if she had suddenly<br> begun disrobing. He clicked his tongue against his teeth several<br> times, muttering ‘My! My!’ and made futile gestures at her. A<br> daring thought went through his mind that he should draw her head<br> onto his shoulder and pat her but he had never done this to any<br> woman and hardly knew how to go about it. Scarlett O'Hara, so high<br> spirited and pretty, crying here in his buggy. Scarlett O'Hara,<br> the proudest of the proud, trying to sell needlework to the<br> Yankees. His heart burned.<br><br> She sobbed on, saying a few words now and then, and he gathered<br> that all was not well at Tara. Mr. O'Hara was still ‘not himself<br> at all,’ and there wasn't enough food to go around for so many. So<br> she had to come to Atlanta to try to make a little money for<br> herself and her boy. Frank clicked his tongue again and suddenly<br> he found that her head was on his shoulder. He did not quite know<br> how it got there. Surely he had not placed it there, but there her<br> head was and there was Scarlett helplessly sobbing against his thin<br> chest, an exciting and novel sensation for him. He patted her<br> shoulder timidly, gingerly at first, and when she did not rebuff<br> him he became bolder and patted her firmly. What a helpless,<br> sweet, womanly little thing she was. And how brave and silly to<br> try her hand at making money by her needle. But dealing with the<br> Yankees--that was too much.<br><br> ‘I won't tell Miss Pittypat, but you must promise me, Miss<br> Scarlett, that you won't do anything like this again. The idea of<br> your father's daughter--’<br><br> Her wet green eyes sought his helplessly.<br><br> ‘But, Mr. Kennedy, I must do something. I must take care of my<br> poor little boy and there is no one to look after us now.’<br><br> ‘You are a brave little woman,’ he pronounced, ‘but I won't have<br> you do this sort of thing. Your family would die of shame.’<br><br> ‘Then what will I do?’ The swimming eyes looked up to him as if<br> she knew he knew everything and was hanging on his words.<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know right now. But I'll think of something.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I know you will! You are so smart--Frank.’<br><br> She had never called him by his first name before and the sound<br> came to him as a pleasant shock and surprise. The poor girl was<br> probably so upset she didn't even notice her slip. He felt very<br> kindly toward her and very protecting. If there was anything he<br> could do for Suellen O'Hara's sister, he would certainly do it. He<br> pulled out a red bandanna handkerchief and handed it to her and she<br> wiped her eyes and began to smile tremulously.<br><br> ‘I'm such a silly little goose,’ she said apologetically. ‘Please<br> forgive me.’<br><br> ‘You aren't a silly little goose. You're a very brave little woman<br> and you are trying to carry to heavy a load. I'm afraid Miss<br> Pittypat isn't going to be much help to you. I hear she lost most<br> of her property and Mr. Henry Hamilton's in bad shape himself. I<br> only wish I had a home to offer you shelter in. But, Miss<br> Scarlett, you just remember this, when Miss Suellen and I are<br> married, there'll always be a place for you under our roof and for<br> Wade Hampton too.’<br><br> Now was the time! Surely the saints and angels watched over her to<br> give her such a Heaven-sent opportunity. She managed to look very<br> startled and embarrassed and opened her mouth as if to speak<br> quickly and then shut it with a pop.<br><br> ‘Don't tell me you didn't know I was to be your brother-in-law this<br> spring,’ he said with nervous jocularity.<br><br> And then, seeing her eyes fill up with tears, he questioned in<br> alarm: ‘What's the matter? Miss Sue's not ill, is she?’<br><br> ‘Oh, no! No!’<br><br> ‘There is something wrong. You must tell me.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I can't! I didn't know! I thought surely she must have<br> written you-- Oh, how mean!’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, what is it?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Frank, I didn't mean to let it out but I thought, of course,<br> you knew--that she had written you--’<br><br> ‘Written me what?’ He was trembling.<br><br> ‘Oh, to do this to a fine man like you!’<br><br> ‘What's she done?’<br><br> ‘She didn't write you? Oh, I guess she was too ashamed to write<br> you. She should be ashamed! Oh, to have such a mean sister!’<br><br> By this time, Frank could not even get questions to his lips. He<br> sat staring at her, gray faced, the reins slack in his hands.<br><br> ‘She's going to marry Tony Fontaine next month. Oh, I'm so sorry,<br> Frank. So sorry to be the one to tell you. She just got tired of<br> waiting and she was afraid she'd be an old maid.’<br><br> <br><br> Mammy was standing on the front porch when Frank helped Scarlett<br> out of the buggy. She had evidently been standing there for some<br> time, for her head rag was damp and the old shawl clutched tightly<br> about her showed rain spots. Her wrinkled black face was a study<br> in anger and apprehension and her lip was pushed out farther than<br> Scarlett could ever remember. She peered quickly at Frank and,<br> when she saw who it was, her face changed--pleasure, bewilderment<br> and something akin to guilt spreading over it. She waddled forward<br> to Frank with pleased greetings and grinned and curtsied when he<br> shook her hand.<br><br> ‘It sho is good ter see home folks,’ she said. ‘How is you, Mist'<br> Frank? My, ain' you lookin' fine an' gran'! Effen Ah'd knowed<br> Miss Scarlett wuz out wid you, Ah wouldn' worrit so. Ah'd knowed<br> she wuz tekken keer of. Ah come back hyah an' fine she gone an' Ah<br> been as 'stracted as a chicken wid its haid off, thinkin' she<br> runnin' roun' dis town by herseff wid all dese trashy free issue<br> niggers on de street. Huccome you din' tell me you gwine out,<br> honey? An' you wid a cole!’<br><br> Scarlett winked slyly at Frank and, for all his distress at the bad<br> news he had just heard, he smiled, knowing she was enjoining<br> silence and making him one in a pleasant conspiracy.<br><br> ‘You run up and fix me some dry clothes, Mammy,’ she said. ‘And<br> some hot tea.’<br><br> ‘Lawd, yo' new dress is plum ruint,’ grumbled Mammy. ‘Ah gwine<br> have a time dryin' it an' brushin' it, so it'll be fit ter be wo'<br> ter de weddin' ternight.’<br><br> She went into the house and Scarlett leaned close to Frank and<br> whispered: ‘Do come to supper tonight. We are so lonesome. And<br> we're going to the wedding afterward. Do be our escort! And,<br> please don't say anything to Aunt Pitty about--about Suellen. It<br> would distress her so much and I can't bear for her to know that my<br> sister--’<br><br> ‘Oh, I won't! I won't!’ Frank said hastily, wincing from the very<br> thought.<br><br> ‘You've been so sweet to me today and done me so much good. I feel<br> right brave again.’ She squeezed his hand in parting and turned<br> the full battery of her eyes upon him.<br><br> Mammy, who was waiting just inside the door, gave her an inscrutable<br> look and followed her, puffing, up the stairs to the bedroom. She<br> was silent while she stripped off the wet clothes and hung them over<br> chairs and tucked Scarlett into bed. When she had brought up a cup<br> of hot tea and a hot brick, rolled in flannel, she looked down at<br> Scarlett and said, with the nearest approach to an apology in her<br> voice Scarlett had ever heard: ‘Lamb, huccome you din' tell yo' own<br> Mammy whut you wuz upter? Den Ah wouldn' had ter traipse all dis<br> way up hyah ter 'Lanta. Ah is too ole an' too fat fer sech runnin'<br> roun'.’<br><br> ‘What do you mean?’<br><br> ‘Honey, you kain fool me. Ah knows you. An' Ah seed Mist' Frank's<br> face jes' now an' Ah seed yo' face, an' Ah kin read yo' mine lak a<br> pahson read a Bible. An' Ah heerd dat whisperin' you wuz givin'<br> him 'bout Miss Suellen. Effen Ah'd had a notion 'twuz Mist' Frank<br> you wuz affer, Ah'd stayed home whar Ah b'longs.’<br><br> ‘Well,’ said Scarlett shortly, snuggling under the blankets and<br> realizing it was useless to try to throw Mammy off the scent, ‘who<br> did you think it was?’<br><br> ‘Chile, Ah din' know but Ah din' lak de look on yo' face yestiddy.<br> An' Ah 'membered Miss Pittypat writin' Miss Melly dat dat<br> rapscallion Butler man had lots of money an' Ah doan fergit whut Ah<br> hears. But Mist' Frank, he a gempmum even ef he ain' so pretty.’<br><br> Scarlett gave her a sharp look and Mammy returned the gaze with<br> calm omniscience.<br><br> ‘Well, what are you going to do about it? Tattle to Suellen?’<br><br> ‘Ah is gwine ter he'p you pleasure Mist' Frank eve'y way Ah knows<br> how,’ said Mammy, tucking the covers about Scarlett's neck.<br><br> Scarlett lay quietly for a while, as Mammy fussed about the room,<br> relief flooding her that there was no need for words between them.<br> No explanations were asked, no reproaches made. Mammy understood<br> and was silent. In Mammy, Scarlett had found a realist more<br> uncompromising than herself. The mottled wise old eyes saw deeply,<br> saw clearly, with the directness of the savage and the child,<br> undeterred by conscience when danger threatened her pet. Scarlett<br> was her baby and what her baby wanted, even though it belonged to<br> another, Mammy was willing to help her obtain. The rights of<br> Suellen and Frank Kennedy did not even enter her mind, save to<br> cause a grim inward chuckle. Scarlett was in trouble and doing the<br> best she could, and Scarlett was Miss Ellen's child. Mammy rallied<br> to her with never a moment's hesitation.<br><br> Scarlett felt the silent reinforcement and, as the hot brick at her<br> feet warmed her, the hope which had flickered faintly on the cold<br> ride home grew into a flame. It swept through her, making her<br> heart pump the blood through her veins in pounding surges.<br> Strength was coming back and a reckless excitement which made her<br> want to laugh aloud. Not beaten yet, she thought exultantly.<br><br> ‘Hand me the mirror, Mammy,’ she said.<br><br> ‘Keep yo' shoulders unner dat kivver,’ ordered Mammy, passing the<br> hand mirror to her, a smile on her thick lips.<br><br> Scarlett looked at herself.<br><br> ‘I look white as a hant,’ she said, ‘and my hair is as wild as a<br> horse's tail.’<br><br> ‘You doan look peart as you mout.’<br><br> ‘Hum. . . . Is it raining very hard?’<br><br> ‘You know it's po'in'.’<br><br> ‘Well, just the same, you've got to go downtown for me.’<br><br> ‘Not in dis rain, Ah ain'.’<br><br> ‘Yes, you are or I'll go myself.’<br><br> ‘Whut you got ter do dat woan wait? Look ter me lak you done nuff<br> fer one day.’<br><br> ‘I want,’ said Scarlett, surveying herself carefully in the mirror,<br> ‘a bottle of cologne water. You can wash my hair and rinse it with<br> cologne. And buy me a jar of quince-seed jelly to make it lie down<br> flat.’<br><br> ‘Ah ain' gwine wash yo' ha'r in dis wedder an' you ain' gwine put<br> no cologne on yo' haid lak a fas' woman needer. Not w'ile Ah got<br> breaf in mah body.’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, I am. Look in my purse and get that five-dollar gold<br> piece out and go to town. And--er, Mammy, while you are downtown,<br> you might get me a--a pot of rouge.’<br><br> ‘Whut dat?’ asked Mammy suspiciously.<br><br> Scarlett met her eyes with a coldness she was far from feeling.<br> There was never any way of knowing just how far Mammy could be<br> bullied.<br><br> ‘Never you mind. Just ask for it.’<br><br> ‘Ah ain' buyin nuthin' dat Ah doan know whut 'tis.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's paint, if you're so curious! Face paint. Don't stand<br> there and swell up like a toad. Go on.’<br><br> ‘Paint!’ ejaculated Mammy. ‘Face paint! Well, you ain' so big dat<br> Ah kain whup you! Ah ain' never been so scan'lized! You is los'<br> yo' mine! Miss Ellen be tuhnin' in her grabe dis minute! Paintin'<br> yo face lak a--’<br><br> ‘You know very well Grandma Robillard painted her face and--’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, an' wo' only one petticoat an' it wrang out wid water ter<br> mek it stick an' show de shape of her laigs, but dat ain' sayin'<br> you is gwine do sumpin' lak dat! Times wuz scan'lous w'en Ole Miss<br> wuz young but times changes, dey do an'--’<br><br> ‘Name of God!’ cried Scarlett, losing her temper and throwing back<br> the covers. ‘You can go straight back to Tara!’<br><br> ‘You kain sen' me ter Tara ness Ah wants ter go. Ah is free,’ said<br> Mammy heatedly. ‘An' Ah is gwine ter stay right hyah. Git back in<br> dat baid. Does you want ter ketch pneumony jes' now? Put down dem<br> stays! Put dem down, honey. Now, Miss Scarlett, you ain' gwine<br> nowhars in dis wedder. Lawd God! But you sho look lak yo' pa!<br> Git back in baid--Ah kain go buyin' no paint! Ah die of shame,<br> eve'ybody knowin 'it wud fer mah chile! Miss Scarlett, you is so<br> sweet an' pretty lookin' you doan need no paint. Honey, doan<br> nobody but bad womens use dat stuff.’<br><br> ‘Well, they get results, don't they?’<br><br> ‘Jesus, hear her! Lamb, doan say bad things lak dat! Put down dem<br> wet stockin's, honey. Ah kain have you buy dat stuff yo'seff.<br> Miss Ellen would hant me. Git back in baid. Ah'll go. Maybe Ah<br> fine me a sto' whar dey doan know us.’<br><br> <br><br> That night at Mrs. Elsing's, when Fanny had been duly married and<br> old Levi and the other musicians were tuning up for the dance,<br> Scarlett looked about her with gladness. It was so exciting to be<br> actually at a party again. She was pleased also with the warm<br> reception she had received. When she entered the house on Frank's<br> arm, everyone had rushed to her with cries of pleasure and welcome,<br> kissed her, shaken her hand, told her they had missed her<br> dreadfully and that she must never go back to Tara. The men seemed<br> gallantly to have forgotten she had tried her best to break their<br> hearts in other days and the girls that she had done everything in<br> her power to entice their beaux away from them. Even Mrs.<br> Merriwether, Mrs. Whiting, Mrs. Meade and the other dowagers who<br> had been so cool to her during the last days of the war, forgot her<br> flighty conduct and their disapproval of it and recalled only that<br> she had suffered in their common defeat and that she was Pitty's<br> niece and Charles' widow. They kissed her and spoke gently with<br> tears in their eyes of her dear mother's passing and asked at<br> length about her father and her sisters. Everyone asked about<br> Melanie and Ashley, demanding the reason why they, too, had not<br> come back to Atlanta.<br><br> In spite of her pleasure at the welcome, Scarlett felt a slight<br> uneasiness which she tried to conceal, an uneasiness about the<br> appearance of her velvet dress. It was still damp to the knees and<br> still spotted about the hem, despite the frantic efforts of Mammy<br> and Cookie with a steaming kettle, a clean hair brush and frantic<br> wavings in front of an open fire. Scarlett was afraid someone<br> would notice her bedraggled state and realize that this was her<br> only nice dress. She was a little cheered by the fact that many of<br> the dresses of the other guests looked far worse than hers. They<br> were so old and had such carefully mended and pressed looks. At<br> least, her dress was whole and new, damp though it was--in fact,<br> the only new dress at the gathering with the exception of Fanny's<br> white-satin wedding gown.<br><br> Remembering what Aunt Pitty had told her about the Elsing finances,<br> she wondered where the money for the satin dress had been obtained<br> and for the refreshments and decorations and musicians too. It<br> must have cost a pretty penny. Borrowed money probably or else the<br> whole Elsing clan had contributed to give Fanny this expensive<br> wedding. Such a wedding in these hard times seemed to Scarlett an<br> extravagance on a par with the tombstones of the Tarleton boys and<br> she felt the same irritation and lack of sympathy she had felt as<br> she stood in the Tarleton burying ground. The days when money<br> could be thrown away carelessly had passed. Why did these people<br> persist in making the gestures of the old days when the old days<br> were gone?<br><br> But she shrugged off her momentary annoyance. It wasn't her money<br> and she didn't want her evening's pleasure spoiled by irritation at<br> other people's foolishness.<br><br> She discovered she knew the groom quite well, for he was Tommy<br> Wellburn from Sparta and she had nursed him in 1863 when he had a<br> wound in his shoulder. He had been a handsome young six-footer<br> then and had given up his medical studies to go in the cavalry.<br> Now he looked like a little old man, so bent was he by the wound in<br> his hip. He walked with some difficulty and, as Aunt Pitty had<br> remarked, spraddled in a very vulgar way. But he seemed totally<br> unaware of his appearance, or unconcerned about it, and had the<br> manner of one who asks no odds from any man. He had given up all<br> hope of continuing his medical studies and was now a contractor,<br> working a labor crew of Irishmen who were building the new hotel.<br> Scarlett wondered how he managed so onerous a job in his condition<br> but asked no questions, realizing wryly that almost anything was<br> possible when necessity drove.<br><br> Tommy and Hugh Elsing and the little monkey-like Rene Picard stood<br> talking with her while the chairs and furniture were pushed back to<br> the wall in preparation for the dancing. Hugh had not changed<br> since Scarlett last saw him in 1862. He was still the thin<br> sensitive boy with the same lock of pale brown hair hanging over<br> his forehead and the same delicate useless-looking hands she<br> remembered so well. But Rene had changed since that furlough when<br> he married Maybelle Merriwether. He still had the Gallic twinkle<br> in his black eyes and the Creole zest for living but, for all his<br> easy laughter, there was something hard about his face which had<br> not been there in the early days of the war. And the air of<br> supercilious elegance which had clung about him in his striking<br> Zouave uniform was completely gone.<br><br> ‘Cheeks lak ze rose, eyes lak ze emerald!’ he said, kissing<br> Scarlett's hand and paying tribute to the rouge upon her face.<br> ‘Pretty lak w'en I first see you at ze bazaar. You remembaire?<br> Nevaire have I forgot how you toss your wedding ring in my basket.<br> Ha, but zat was brave! But I should nevaire have zink you wait so<br> long to get anothaire ring!’<br><br> His eyes sparkled wickedly and he dug his elbow into Hugh's ribs.<br><br> ‘And I never thought you'd be driving a pie wagon, Renny Picard,’<br> she said. Instead of being ashamed at having his degrading<br> occupation thrown in his face, he seemed pleased and laughed<br> uproariously, slapping Hugh on the back.<br><br> ‘Touche!’ he cried. ‘Belle Mere, Madame Merriwether, she mek me do<br> eet, ze first work I do en all my life, Rene Picard, who was to<br> grow old breeding ze race horse, playing ze feedle! Now, I drive<br> ze pie wagon and I lak eet! Madame Belle Mere, she can mek a man<br> do annyzing. She should have been ze general and we win ze war,<br> eh, Tommy?’<br><br> Well! thought Scarlett. The idea of liking to drive a pie wagon<br> when his people used to own ten miles along the Mississippi River<br> and a big house in New Orleans, too!<br><br> ‘If we'd had our mothers-in-law in the ranks, we'd have beat the<br> Yankees in a week,’ agreed Tommy, his eyes straying to the slender,<br> indomitable form of his new mother-in-law. ‘The only reason we<br> lasted as long as we did was because of the ladies behind us who<br> wouldn't give up.’<br><br> ‘Who'll NEVER give up,’ amended Hugh, and his smile was proud but a<br> little wry. ‘There's not a lady here tonight who has surrendered,<br> no matter what her men folks did at Appomattox. It's a lot worse<br> on them than it ever was on us. At least, we took it out in<br> fighting.’<br><br> ‘And they in hating,’ finished Tommy. ‘Eh, Scarlett? It bothers<br> the ladies to see what their men folks have come down to lots more<br> than it bothers us. Hugh was to be a judge, Rene was to play the<br> fiddle before the crowned heads of Europe--’ He ducked as Rene<br> aimed a blow at him. ‘And I was to be a doctor and now--’<br><br> ‘Geeve us ze time!’ cried Rene. ‘Zen I become ze Pie Prince of ze<br> South! And my good Hugh ze King of ze Kindling and you, my Tommy,<br> you weel own ze Irish slaves instead of ze darky slaves. What<br> changes--what fun! And what eet do for you, Mees Scarlett, and<br> Mees Melly? You meelk ze cow, peek ze cotton?’<br><br> ‘Indeed, no!’ said Scarlett coolly, unable to understand Rene's gay<br> acceptance of hardships. ‘Our darkies do that.’<br><br> ‘Mees Melly, I hear she call her boy 'Beauregard.' You tell her I,<br> Rene, approve and say that except for 'Jesus' there is no bettaire<br> name.’<br><br> And though he smiled, his eyes glowed proudly at the name of<br> Louisiana's dashing hero.<br><br> ‘Well, there's 'Robert Edward Lee,'‘ observed Tommy. ‘And while<br> I'm not trying to lessen Old Beau's reputation, my first son is<br> going to be named 'Bob Lee Wellburn.'‘<br><br> Rend laughed and shrugged.<br><br> ‘I recount to you a joke but eet eez a true story. And you see how<br> Creoles zink of our brave Beauregard and of your General Lee. On<br> ze train near New Orleans a man of Virginia, a man of General Lee,<br> he meet wiz a Creole of ze troops of Beauregard. And ze man of<br> Virginia, he talk, talk, talk how General Lee do zis, General Lee<br> say zat. And ze Creole, he look polite and he wreenkle hees<br> forehead lak he try to remembaire, and zen he smile and say:<br> 'General Lee! Ah, oui! Now I know! General Lee! Ze man General<br> Beauregard speak well of!'‘<br><br> Scarlett tried to join politely in the laughter but she did not see<br> any point to the story except that Creoles were just as stuck up as<br> Charleston and Savannah people. Moreover, she had always thought<br> Ashley's son should have been named after him.<br><br> The musicians after preliminary tunings and whangings broke into<br> ‘Old Dan Tucker’ and Tommy turned to her.<br><br> ‘Will you dance, Scarlett? I can't favor you but Hugh or Rene--’<br><br> ‘No, thank you. I'm still mourning my mother,’ said Scarlett<br> hastily. ‘I will sit them out.’<br><br> Her eyes singled out Frank Kennedy and beckoned him from the side<br> of Mrs. Elsing.<br><br> ‘I'll sit in that alcove yonder if you'll bring me some<br> refreshments and then we can have a nice chat,’ she told Frank as<br> the other three men moved off.<br><br> When he had hurried away to bring her a glass of wine and a paper<br> thin slice of cake, Scarlett sat down in the alcove at the end of<br> the drawing room and carefully arranged her skirts so that the<br> worst spots would not show. The humiliating events of the morning<br> with Rhett were pushed from her mind by the excitement of seeing so<br> many people and hearing music again. Tomorrow she would think of<br> Rhett's conduct and her shame and they would make her writhe again.<br> Tomorrow she would wonder if she had made any impression on Frank's<br> hurt and bewildered heart. But not tonight. Tonight she was alive<br> to her finger tips, every sense alert with hope, her eyes<br> sparkling.<br><br> She looked from the alcove into the huge drawing room and watched<br> the dancers, remembering how beautiful this room had been when<br> first she came to Atlanta during the war. Then the hardwood floors<br> had shone like glass, and overhead the chandelier with its hundreds<br> of tiny prisms had caught and reflected every ray of the dozens of<br> candles it bore, flinging them, like gleams from diamonds, flame<br> and sapphire about the room. The old portraits on the walls had<br> been dignified and gracious and had looked down upon guests with an<br> air of mellowed hospitality. The rosewood sofas had been soft and<br> inviting and one of them, the largest, had stood in the place of<br> honor in this same alcove where she now sat. It had been<br> Scarlett's favorite seat at parties. From this point stretched the<br> pleasant vista of drawing room and dining room beyond, the oval<br> mahogany table which seated twenty and the twenty slim-legged<br> chairs demurely against the walls, the massive sideboard and buffet<br> weighted with heavy silver, with seven-branched candlesticks,<br> goblets, cruets, decanters and shining little glasses. Scarlett<br> had sat on that sofa so often in the first years of the war, always<br> with some handsome officer beside her, and listened to violin and<br> bull fiddle, accordion and banjo, and heard the exciting swishing<br> noises which dancing feet made on the waxed and polished floor.<br><br> Now the chandelier hung dark. It was twisted askew and most of the<br> prisms were broken, as if the Yankee occupants had made their<br> beauty a target for their boots. Now an oil lamp and a few candles<br> lighted the room and the roaring fire in the wide hearth gave most<br> of the illumination. Its flickering light showed how irreparably<br> scarred and splintered the dull old floor was. Squares on the<br> faded paper on the wall gave evidence that once the portraits had<br> hung there, and wide cracks in the plaster recalled the day during<br> the siege when a shell had exploded on the house and torn off parts<br> of the roof and second floor. The heavy old mahogany table, spread<br> with cake and decanters, still presided in the empty-looking dining<br> room but it was scratched and the broken legs showed signs of<br> clumsy repair. The sideboard, the silver and the spindly chairs<br> were gone. The dull-gold damask draperies which had covered the<br> arching French windows at the back of the room were missing, and<br> only the remnants of the lace curtains remained, clean but<br> obviously mended.<br><br> In place of the curved sofa she had liked so much was a hard bench<br> that was none too comfortable. She sat upon it with as good grace<br> as possible, wishing her skirts were in such condition that she<br> could dance. It would be so good to dance again. But, of course,<br> she could do more with Frank in this sequestered alcove than in a<br> breathless reel and she could listen fascinated to his talk and<br> encourage him to greater flights of foolishness.<br><br> But the music certainly was inviting. Her slipper patted longingly<br> in time with old Levi's large splayed foot as he twanged a strident<br> banjo and called the figures of the reel. Feet swished and scraped<br> and patted as the twin lines danced toward each other, retreated,<br> whirled and made arches of their arms.<br><br> <br> ‘'Ole Dan Tucker he got drunk--'<br> (Swing yo' padners!)<br> 'Fell in de fiah' an' he kick up a chunk!'<br> (Skip light, ladies!)’<br><br> <br> After the dull and exhausting months at Tara it was good to hear<br> music again and the sound of dancing feet, good to see familiar<br> friendly faces laughing in the feeble light, calling old jokes and<br> catchwords, bantering, rallying, coquetting. It was like coming to<br> life again after being dead. It almost seemed that the bright days<br> of five years ago had come back again. If she could close her eyes<br> and not see the worn made-over dresses and the patched boots and<br> mended slippers, if her mind did not call up the faces of boys<br> missing from the reel, she might almost think that nothing had<br> changed. But as she looked, watching the old men grouped about the<br> decanter in the dining room, the matrons lining the walls, talking<br> behind fanless hands, and the swaying, skipping young dancers, it<br> came to her suddenly, coldly, frighteningly that it was all as<br> greatly changed as if these familiar figures were ghosts.<br><br> They looked the same but they were different. What was it? Was it<br> only that they were five years older? No, it was something more<br> than the passing of time. Something had gone out of them, out of<br> their world. Five years ago, a feeling of security had wrapped<br> them all around so gently they were not even aware of it. In its<br> shelter they had flowered. Now it was gone and with it had gone<br> the old thrill, the old sense of something delightful and exciting<br> just around the corner, the old glamor of their way of living.<br><br> She knew she had changed too, but not as they had changed, and it<br> puzzled her. She sat and watched them and she felt herself an<br> alien among them, as alien and lonely as if she had come from<br> another world, speaking a language they did not understand and she<br> not understanding theirs. Then she knew that this feeling was the<br> same one she felt with Ashley. With him and with people of his<br> kind--and they made up most of her world--she felt outside of<br> something she could not understand.<br><br> Their faces were little changed and their manners not at all but it<br> seemed to her that these two things were all that remained of her<br> old friends. An ageless dignity, a timeless gallantry still clung<br> about them and would cling until they died but they would carry<br> undying bitterness to their graves, a bitterness too deep for<br> words. They were a soft-spoken, fierce, tired people who were<br> defeated and would not know defeat, broken yet standing determinedly<br> erect. They were crushed and helpless, citizens of conquered<br> provinces. They were looking on the state they loved, seeing it<br> trampled by the enemy, rascals making a mock of the law, their<br> former slaves a menace, their men disfranchised, their women<br> insulted. And they were remembering graves.<br><br> Everything in their old world had changed but the old forms. The<br> old usages went on, must go on, for the forms were all that were<br> left to them. They were holding tightly to the things they knew<br> best and loved best in the old days, the leisured manners, the<br> courtesy, the pleasant casualness in human contacts and, most of<br> all, the protecting attitude of the men toward their women. True<br> to the tradition in which they had been reared, the men were<br> courteous and tender and they almost succeeded in creating an<br> atmosphere of sheltering their women from all that was harsh and<br> unfit for feminine eyes. That, thought Scarlett, was the height of<br> absurdity, for there was little, now, which even the most<br> cloistered women had not seen and known in the last five years.<br> They had nursed the wounded, closed dying eyes, suffered war and<br> fire and devastation, known terror and flight and starvation.<br><br> But, no matter what sights they had seen, what menial tasks they<br> had done and would have to do, they remained ladies and gentlemen,<br> royalty in exile--bitter, aloof, incurious, kind to one another,<br> diamond hard, as bright and brittle as the crystals of the broken<br> chandelier over their heads. The old days had gone but these<br> people would go their ways as if the old days still existed,<br> charming, leisurely, determined not to rush and scramble for<br> pennies as the Yankees did, determined to part with none of the old<br> ways.<br><br> Scarlett knew that she, too, was greatly changed. Otherwise she<br> could not have done the things she had done since she was last in<br> Atlanta; otherwise she would not now be contemplating doing what<br> she desperately hoped to do. But there was a difference in their<br> hardness and hers and just what the difference was, she could not,<br> for the moment, tell. Perhaps it was that there was nothing she<br> would not do, and there were so many things these people would<br> rather die than do. Perhaps it was that they were without hope but<br> still smiling at life, bowing gracefully and passing it by. And<br> this Scarlett could not do.<br><br> She could not ignore life. She had to live it and it was too<br> brutal, too hostile, for her even to try to gloss over its<br> harshness with a smile. Of the sweetness and courage and<br> unyielding pride of her friends, Scarlett saw nothing. She saw<br> only a silly stiff-neckedness which observed facts but smiled and<br> refused to look them in the face.<br><br> As she stared at the dancers, flushed from the reel, she wondered<br> if things drove them as she was driven, dead lovers, maimed<br> husbands, children who were hungry, acres slipping away, beloved<br> roofs that sheltered strangers. But, of course, they were driven!<br> She knew their circumstances only a little less thoroughly than she<br> knew her own. Their losses had been her losses, their privations<br> her privations, their problems her same problems. Yet they had<br> reacted differently to them. The faces she was seeing in the room<br> were not faces; they were masks, excellent masks which would never<br> drop.<br><br> But if they were suffering as acutely from brutal circumstances as<br> she was--and they were--how could they maintain this air of gaiety<br> and lightness of heart? Why, indeed, should they even try to do<br> it? They were beyond her comprehension and vaguely irritating.<br> She couldn't be like them. She couldn't survey the wreck of the<br> world with an air of casual unconcern. She was as hunted as a fox,<br> running with a bursting heart, trying to reach a burrow before the<br> hounds caught up.<br><br> Suddenly she hated them all because they were different from her,<br> because they carried their losses with an air that she could never<br> attain, would never wish to attain. She hated them, these smiling,<br> light-footed strangers, these proud fools who took pride in<br> something they had lost, seeming to be proud that they had lost it.<br> The women bore themselves like ladies and she knew they were<br> ladies, though menial tasks were their daily lot and they didn't<br> know where their next dress was coming from. Ladies all! But she<br> could not feel herself a lady, for all her velvet dress and scented<br> hair, for all the pride of birth that stood behind her and the<br> pride of wealth that had once been hers. Harsh contact with the<br> red earth of Tara had stripped gentility from her and she knew she<br> would never feel like a lady again until her table was weighted<br> with silver and crystal and smoking with rich food, until her own<br> horses and carriages stood in her stables, until black hands and<br> not white took the cotton from Tara.<br><br> ‘Ah!’ she thought angrily, sucking in her breath. ‘That's the<br> difference! Even though they're poor, they still feel like ladies<br> and I don't. The silly fools don't seem to realize that you can't<br> be a lady without money!’<br><br> Even in this flash of revelation, she realized vaguely that,<br> foolish though they seemed, theirs was the right attitude. Ellen<br> would have thought so. This disturbed her. She knew she should<br> feel as these people felt, but she could not. She knew she should<br> believe devoutly, as they did, that a born lady remained a lady,<br> even if reduced to poverty, but she could not make herself believe<br> it now.<br><br> All her life she had heard sneers hurled at the Yankees because<br> their pretensions to gentility were based on wealth, not breeding.<br> But at this moment, heresy though it was, she could not help<br> thinking the Yankees were right on this one matter, even if wrong<br> in all others. It took money to be a lady. She knew Ellen would<br> have fainted had she ever heard such words from her daughter. No<br> depth of poverty could ever have made Ellen feel ashamed. Ashamed!<br> Yes, that was how Scarlett felt. Ashamed that she was poor and<br> reduced to galling shifts and penury and work that negroes should<br> do.<br><br> She shrugged in irritation. Perhaps these people were right and<br> she was wrong but, just the same, these proud fools weren't looking<br> forward as she was doing, straining every nerve, risking even honor<br> and good name to get back what they had lost. It was beneath the<br> dignity of any of them to indulge in a scramble for money. The<br> times were rude and hard. They called for rude and hard struggle<br> if one was to conquer them. Scarlett knew that family tradition<br> would forcibly restrain many of these people from such a struggle--<br> with the making of money admittedly its aim. They all thought that<br> obvious money-making and even talk of money were vulgar in the<br> extreme. Of course, there were exceptions. Mrs. Merriwether and<br> her baking and Rene driving the pie wagon. And Hugh Elsing cutting<br> and peddling firewood and Tommy contracting. And Frank having the<br> gumption to start a store. But what of the rank and file of them?<br> The planters would scratch a few acres and live in poverty. The<br> lawyers and doctors would go back to their professions and wait for<br> clients who might never come. And the rest, those who had lived in<br> leisure on their incomes? What would happen to them?<br><br> But she wasn't going to be poor all her life. She wasn't going to<br> sit down and patiently wait for a miracle to help her. She was<br> going to rush into life and wrest from it what she could. Her<br> father had started as a poor immigrant boy and had won the broad<br> acres of Tara. What he had done, his daughter could do. She<br> wasn't like these people who had gambled everything on a Cause that<br> was gone and were content to be proud of having lost that Cause,<br> because it was worth any sacrifice. They drew their courage from<br> the past. She was drawing hers from the future. Frank Kennedy, at<br> present, was her future. At least, he had the store and he had<br> cash money. And if she could only marry him and get her hands on<br> that money, she could make ends meet at Tara for another year. And<br> after that--Frank must buy the sawmill. She could see for herself<br> how quickly the town was rebuilding and anyone who could establish<br> a lumber business now, when there was so little competition, would<br> have a gold mine.<br><br> There came to her, from the recesses of her mind, words Rhett had<br> spoken in the early years of the war about the money he made in the<br> blockade. She had not taken the trouble to understand them then,<br> but now they seemed perfectly clear and she wondered if it had been<br> only her youth or plain stupidity which had kept her from<br> appreciating them.<br><br> ‘There's just as much money to be made in the wreck of a<br> civilization as in the upbuilding of one.’<br><br> ‘This is the wreck he foresaw,’ she thought, ‘and he was right.<br> There's still plenty of money to be made by anyone who isn't afraid<br> to work--or to grab.’<br><br> She saw Frank coming across the floor toward her with a glass of<br> blackberry wine in his hand and a morsel of cake on a saucer and<br> she pulled her face into a smile. It did not occur to her to<br> question whether Tara was worth marrying Frank. She knew it was<br> worth it and she never gave the matter a second thought.<br><br> She smiled up at him as she sipped the wine, knowing that her<br> cheeks were more attractively pink than any of the dancers'. She<br> moved her skirts for him to sit by her and waved her handkerchief<br> idly so that the faint sweet smell of the cologne could reach his<br> nose. She was proud of the cologne, for no other woman in the room<br> was wearing any and Frank had noticed it. In a fit of daring he<br> had whispered to her that she was as pink and fragrant as a rose.<br><br> If only he were not so shy! He reminded her of a timid old brown<br> field rabbit. If only he had the gallantry and ardor of the<br> Tarleton boys or even the coarse impudence of Rhett Butler. But,<br> if he possessed those qualities, he'd probably have sense enough to<br> feel the desperation that lurked just beneath her demurely<br> fluttering eyelids. As it was, he didn't know enough about women<br> even to suspect what she was up to. That was her good fortune but<br> it did not increase her respect for him.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXVI<br><br> <br> She married Frank Kennedy two weeks later after a whirlwind<br> courtship which she blushingly told him left her too breathless to<br> oppose his ardor any longer.<br><br> He did not know that during those two weeks she had walked the<br> floor at night, gritting her teeth at the slowness with which he<br> took hints and encouragements, praying that no untimely letter from<br> Suellen would reach him and ruin her plans. She thanked God that<br> her sister was the poorest of correspondents, delighting to receive<br> letters and disliking to write them. But there was always a<br> chance, always a chance, she thought in the long night hours as she<br> padded back and forth across the cold floor of her bedroom, with<br> Ellen's faded shawl clutched about her nightdress. Frank did not<br> know she had received a laconic letter from Will, relating that<br> Jonas Wilkerson had paid another call at Tara and, finding her gone<br> to Atlanta, had stormed about until Will and Ashley threw him<br> bodily off the place. Will's letter hammered into her mind the<br> fact she knew only too well--that time was getting shorter and<br> shorter before the extra taxes must be paid. A fierce desperation<br> drove her as she saw the days slipping by and she wished she might<br> grasp the hourglass in her hands and keep the sands from running.<br><br> But so well did she conceal her feelings, so well did she enact her<br> role, Frank suspected nothing, saw no more than what lay on the<br> surface--the pretty and helpless young widow of Charles Hamilton<br> who greeted him every night in Miss Pittypat's parlor and listened,<br> breathless with admiration, as he told of future plans for his<br> store and how much money he expected to make when he was able to<br> buy the sawmill. Her sweet sympathy and her bright-eyed interest<br> in every word he uttered were balm upon the wound left by Suellen's<br> supposed defection. His heart was sore and bewildered at Suellen's<br> conduct and his vanity, the shy, touchy vanity of a middle-aged<br> bachelor who knows himself to be unattractive to women, was deeply<br> wounded. He could not write Suellen, upbraiding her for her<br> faithlessness; he shrank from the very idea. But he could ease his<br> heart by talking about her to Scarlett. Without saying a disloyal<br> word about Suellen, she could tell him she understood how badly her<br> sister had treated him and what good treatment he merited from a<br> woman who really appreciated him.<br><br> Little Mrs. Hamilton was such a pretty pink-cheeked person,<br> alternating between melancholy sighs when she thought of her sad<br> plight, and laughter as gay and sweet as the tinkling of tiny<br> silver bells when he made small jokes to cheer her. Her green<br> gown, now neatly cleaned by Mammy, showed off her slender figure<br> with its tiny waist to perfection, and how bewitching was the faint<br> fragrance which always clung about her handkerchief and her hair!<br> It was a shame that such a fine little woman should be alone and<br> helpless in a world so rough that she didn't even understand its<br> harshness. No husband nor brother nor even a father now to protect<br> her. Frank thought the world too rude a place for a lone woman<br> and, in that idea, Scarlett silently and heartily concurred.<br><br> He came to call every night, for the atmosphere of Pitty's house<br> was pleasant and soothing. Mammy's smile at the front door was the<br> smile reserved for quality folks, Pitty served him coffee laced<br> with brandy and fluttered about him and Scarlett hung on his every<br> utterance. Sometimes in the afternoons he took Scarlett riding<br> with him in his buggy when he went out on business. These rides<br> were merry affairs because she asked so many foolish questions--<br> ‘just like a woman,’ he told himself approvingly. He couldn't help<br> laughing at her ignorance about business matters and she laughed<br> too, saying: ‘Well, of course, you can't expect a silly little<br> woman like me to understand men's affairs.’<br><br> She made him feel, for the first time in his old-maidish life, that<br> he was a strong upstanding man fashioned by God in a nobler mold<br> than other men, fashioned to protect silly helpless women.<br><br> When, at last, they stood together to be married, her confiding<br> little hand in his and her downcast lashes throwing thick black<br> crescents on her pink cheeks, he still did not know how it all came<br> about. He only knew he had done something romantic and exciting<br> for the first time in his life. He, Frank Kennedy, had swept this<br> lovely creature off her feet and into his strong arms. That was a<br> heady feeling.<br><br> No friend or relative stood up with them at their marriage. The<br> witnesses were strangers called in from the street. Scarlett had<br> insisted on that and he had given in, though reluctantly, for he<br> would have liked his sister and his brother-in-law from Jonesboro<br> to be with him. And a reception with toasts drunk to the bride in<br> Miss Pitty's parlor amid happy friends would have been a joy to<br> him. But Scarlett would not hear of even Miss Pitty being present.<br><br> ‘Just us two, Frank,’ she begged, squeezing his arm. ‘Like an<br> elopement. I always did want to run away and be married! Please,<br> sweetheart, just for me!’<br><br> It was that endearing term, still so new to his ears, and the<br> bright teardrops which edged her pale green eyes as she looked up<br> pleadingly at him that won him over. After all, a man had to make<br> some concessions to his bride, especially about the wedding, for<br> women set such a store by sentimental things.<br><br> And before he knew it, he was married.<br><br> <br><br> Frank gave her the three hundred dollars, bewildered by her sweet<br> urgency, reluctant at first, because it meant the end of his hope<br> of buying the sawmill immediately. But he could not see her family<br> evicted, and his disappointment soon faded at the sight of her<br> radiant happiness, disappeared entirely at the loving way she ‘took<br> on’ over his generosity. Frank had never before had a woman ‘take<br> on’ over him and he came to feel that the money had been well<br> spent, after all.<br><br> Scarlett dispatched Mammy to Tara immediately for the triple<br> purpose of giving Will the money, announcing her marriage and<br> bringing Wade to Atlanta. In two days she had a brief note from<br> Will which she carried about with her and read and reread with<br> mounting joy. Will wrote that the taxes had been paid and Jonas<br> Wilkerson ‘acted up pretty bad’ at the news but had made no other<br> threats so far. Will closed by wishing her happiness, a laconic<br> formal statement which he qualified in no way. She knew Will<br> understood what she had done and why she had done it and neither<br> blamed nor praised. But what must Ashley think? she wondered<br> feverishly. What must he think of me now, after what I said to him<br> so short a while ago in the orchard at Tara?<br><br> She also had a letter from Suellen, poorly spelled, violent,<br> abusive, tear splotched, a letter so full of venom and truthful<br> observations upon her character that she was never to forget it nor<br> forgive the writer. But even Suellen's words could not dim her<br> happiness that Tara was safe, at least from immediate danger.<br><br> It was hard to realize that Atlanta and not Tara was her permanent<br> home now. In her desperation to obtain the tax money, no thought<br> save Tara and the fate which threatened it had any place in her<br> mind. Even at the moment of marriage, she had not given a thought<br> to the fact that the price she was paying for the safety of home<br> was permanent exile from it. Now that the deed was done, she<br> realized this with a wave of homesickness hard to dispel. But<br> there it was. She had made her bargain and she intended to stand<br> by it. And she was so grateful to Frank for saving Tara she felt a<br> warm affection for him and an equally warm determination that he<br> should never regret marrying her.<br><br> The ladies of Atlanta knew their neighbors' business only slightly<br> less completely than they knew their own and were far more<br> interested in it. They all knew that for years Frank Kennedy had<br> had an ‘understanding’ with Suellen O'Hara. In fact, he had said,<br> sheepishly, that he expected to get married in the spring. So the<br> tumult of gossip, surmise and deep suspicion which followed the<br> announcement of his quiet wedding to Scarlett was not surprising.<br> Mrs. Merriwether, who never let her curiosity go long unsatisfied<br> if she could help it, asked him point-blank just what he meant by<br> marrying one sister when he was betrothed to the other. She<br> reported to Mrs. Elsing that all the answer she got for her pains<br> was a silly look. Not even Mrs. Merriwether, doughty soul that she<br> was, dared to approach Scarlett on the subject. Scarlett seemed<br> demure and sweet enough these days, but there was a pleased<br> complacency in her eyes which annoyed people and she carried a chip<br> on her shoulder which no one cared to disturb.<br><br> She knew Atlanta was talking but she did not care. Alter all,<br> there wasn't anything immoral in marrying a man. Tara was safe.<br> Let people talk. She had too many other matters to occupy her<br> mind. The most important was how to make Frank realize, in a<br> tactful manner, that his store should bring in more money. After<br> the fright Jonas Wilkerson had given her, she would never rest easy<br> until she and Frank had some money ahead. And even if no emergency<br> developed, Frank would need to make more money, if she was going to<br> save enough for next year's taxes. Moreover, what Frank had said<br> about the sawmill stuck in her mind. Frank could make lots of<br> money out of a mill. Anybody could, with lumber selling at such<br> outrageous prices. She fretted silently because Frank's money had<br> not been enough to pay the taxes on Tara and buy the mill as well.<br> And she made up her mind that he had to make more money on the<br> store somehow, and do it quickly, so he could buy that mill before<br> some one else snapped it up. She could see it was a bargain.<br><br> If she were a man she would have that mill, if she had to mortgage<br> the store to raise the money. But, when she intimated this<br> delicately to Frank, the day after they married, he smiled and told<br> her not to bother her sweet pretty little head about business<br> matters. It had come as a surprise to him that she even knew what<br> a mortgage was and, at first, he was amused. But this amusement<br> quickly passed and a sense of shock took its place in the early<br> days of their marriage. Once, incautiously, he had told her that<br> ‘people’ (he was careful not to mention names) owed him money but<br> could not pay just now and he was, of course, unwilling to press<br> old friends and gentlefolk. Frank regretted ever mentioning it<br> for, thereafter, she had questioned him about it again and again.<br> She had the most charmingly childlike air but she was just curious,<br> she said, to know who owed him and how much they owed. Frank was<br> very evasive about the matter. He coughed nervously and waved his<br> hands and repeated his annoying remark about her sweet pretty<br> little head.<br><br> It had begun to dawn on him that this same sweet pretty little head<br> was a ‘good head for figures.’ In fact, a much better one than his<br> own and the knowledge was disquieting. He was thunderstruck to<br> discover that she could swiftly add a long column of figures in her<br> head when he needed a pencil and paper for more than three figures.<br> And fractions presented no difficulties to her at all. He felt<br> there was something unbecoming about a woman understanding<br> fractions and business matters and he believed that, should a woman<br> be so unfortunate as to have such unladylike comprehension, she<br> should pretend not to. Now he disliked talking business with her<br> as much as he had enjoyed it before they were married. Then he had<br> thought it all beyond her mental grasp and it had been pleasant to<br> explain things to her. Now he saw that she understood entirely too<br> well and he felt the usual masculine indignation at the duplicity<br> of women. Added to it was the usual masculine disillusionment in<br> discovering that a woman has a brain.<br><br> Just how early in his married life Frank learned of the deception<br> Scarlett had used in marrying him, no one ever knew. Perhaps the<br> truth dawned on him when Tony Fontaine, obviously fancy free, came<br> to Atlanta on business. Perhaps it was told him more directly in<br> letters from his sister in Jonesboro who was astounded at his<br> marriage. Certainly he never learned from Suellen herself. She<br> never wrote him and naturally he could not write her and explain.<br> What good would explanations do anyway, now that he was married?<br> He writhed inwardly at the thought that Suellen would never know<br> the truth and would always think he had senselessly jilted her.<br> Probably everyone else was thinking this too and criticizing him.<br> It certainly put him in an awkward position. And he had no way of<br> clearing himself, for a man couldn't go about saying he had lost<br> his head about a woman--and a gentleman couldn't advertise the fact<br> that his wife had entrapped him with a lie.<br><br> Scarlett was his wife and a wife was entitled to the loyalty of her<br> husband. Furthermore, he could not bring himself to believe she<br> had married him coldly and with no affection for him at all. His<br> masculine vanity would not permit such a thought to stay long in<br> his mind. It was more pleasant to think she had fallen so suddenly<br> in love with him she had been willing to lie to get him. But it<br> was all very puzzling. He knew he was no great catch for a woman<br> half his age and pretty and smart to boot, but Frank was a<br> gentleman and he kept his bewilderment to himself. Scarlett was<br> his wife and he could not insult her by asking awkward questions<br> which, after all, would not remedy matters.<br><br> Not that Frank especially wanted to remedy matters, for it appeared<br> that his marriage would be a happy one. Scarlett was the most<br> charming and exciting of women and he thought her perfect in all<br> things--except that she was so headstrong. Frank learned early in<br> his marriage that so long as she had her own way, life could be<br> very pleasant, but when she was opposed-- Given her own way, she<br> was as gay as a child, laughed a good deal, made foolish little<br> jokes, sat on his knee and tweaked his beard until he vowed he felt<br> twenty years younger. She could be unexpectedly sweet and<br> thoughtful, having his slippers toasting at the fire when he came<br> home at night, fussing affectionately about his wet feet and<br> interminable head colds, remembering that he always liked the<br> gizzard of the chicken and three spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee.<br> Yes, life was very sweet and cozy with Scarlett--as long as she had<br> her own way.<br><br> <br><br> When the marriage was two weeks old, Frank contracted the grippe<br> and Dr. Meade put him to bed. In the first year of the war, Frank<br> had spent two months in the hospital with pneumonia and he had<br> lived in dread of another attack since that time, so he was only<br> too glad to lie sweating under three blankets and drink the hot<br> concoctions Mammy and Aunt Pitty brought him every hour.<br><br> The illness dragged on and Frank worried more and more about the<br> store as each day passed. The place was in charge of the counter<br> boy, who came to the house every night to report on the day's<br> transactions, but Frank was not satisfied. He fretted until<br> Scarlett who had only been waiting for such an opportunity laid a<br> cool hand on his forehead and said: ‘Now, sweetheart, I shall be<br> vexed if you take on so. I'll go to town and see how things are.’<br><br> And she went, smiling as she smothered his feeble protests. During<br> the three weeks of her new marriage, she had been in a fever to see<br> his account books and find out just how money matters stood. What<br> luck that he was bedridden!<br><br> The store stood near Five Points, its new roof glaring against the<br> smoked bricks of the old walls. Wooden awnings covered the<br> sidewalk to the edge of the street, and at the long iron bars<br> connecting the uprights horses and mules were hitched, their heads<br> bowed against the cold misty rain, their backs covered with torn<br> blankets and quilts. The inside of the store was almost like<br> Bullard's store in Jonesboro, except that there were no loungers<br> about the roaring red-hot stove, whittling and spitting streams of<br> tobacco juice at the sand boxes. It was bigger than Bullard's<br> store and much darker. The wooden awnings cut off most of the<br> winter daylight and the interior was dim and dingy, only a trickle<br> of light coming in through the small fly-specked windows high up on<br> the side walls. The floor was covered with muddy sawdust and<br> everywhere was dust and dirt. There was a semblance of order in<br> the front of the store, where tall shelves rose into the gloom<br> stacked with bright bolts of cloth, china, cooking utensils and<br> notions. But in the back, behind the partition, chaos reigned.<br><br> Here there was no flooring and the assorted jumble of stock was<br> piled helter-skelter on the hard-packed earth. In the semi-<br> darkness she saw boxes and bales of goods, plows and harness and<br> saddles and cheap pine coffins. Secondhand furniture, ranging from<br> cheap gum to mahogany and rosewood, reared up in the gloom, and the<br> rich but worn brocade and horsehair upholstery gleamed incongruously<br> in the dingy surroundings. China chambers and bowl and pitcher sets<br> littered the floor and all around the four walls were deep bins, so<br> dark she had to hold the lamp directly over them to discover they<br> contained seeds, nails, bolts and carpenters' tools.<br><br> ‘I'd think a man as fussy and old maidish as Frank would keep<br> things tidier,’ she thought, scrubbing her grimy hands with her<br> handkerchief. ‘This place is a pig pen. What a way to run a<br> store! If he'd only dust up this stuff and put it out in front<br> where folks could see it, he could sell things much quicker.’<br><br> And if his stock was in such condition, what mustn't his accounts<br> be!<br><br> I'll look at his account book now, she thought and, picking up the<br> lamp, she went into the front of the store. Willie, the counter<br> boy, was reluctant to give her the large dirty-backed ledger. It<br> was obvious that, young as he was, he shared Frank's opinion that<br> women had no place in business. But Scarlett silenced him with a<br> sharp word and sent him out to get his dinner. She felt better<br> when he was gone, for his disapproval annoyed her, and she settled<br> herself in a split-bottomed chair by the roaring stove, tucked one<br> foot under her and spread the book across her lap. It was dinner<br> time and the streets were deserted. No customers called and she<br> had the store to herself.<br><br> She turned the pages slowly, narrowly scanning the rows of names<br> and figures written in Frank's cramped copperplate hand. It was<br> just as she had expected, and she frowned as she saw this newest<br> evidence of Frank's lack of business sense. At least five hundred<br> dollars in debts, some of them months old, were set down against<br> the names of people she knew well, the Merriwethers and the Elsings<br> among other familiar names. From Frank's deprecatory remarks about<br> the money ‘people’ owed him, she had imagined the sums to be small.<br> But this!<br><br> ‘If they can't pay, why do they keep on buying?’ she thought<br> irritably. ‘And if he knows they can't pay, why does he keep on<br> selling them stuff? Lots of them could pay if he'd just make them<br> do it. The Elsings certainly could if they could give Fanny a new<br> satin dress and an expensive wedding. Frank's just too soft<br> hearted, and people take advantage of him. Why, if he'd collected<br> half this money, he could have bought the sawmill and easily spared<br> me the tax money, too.’<br><br> Then she thought: ‘Just imagine Frank trying to operate a sawmill!<br> God's nightgown! If he runs this store like a charitable<br> institution, how could he expect to make money on a mill? The<br> sheriff would have it in a month. Why, I could run this store<br> better than he does! And I could run a mill better than he could,<br> even if I don't know anything about the lumber business!’<br><br> A startling thought this, that a woman could handle business<br> matters as well as or better than a man, a revolutionary thought to<br> Scarlett who had been reared in the tradition that men were<br> omniscient and women none too bright. Of course, she had<br> discovered that this was not altogether true but the pleasant<br> fiction still stuck in her mind. Never before had she put this<br> remarkable idea into words. She sat quite still, with the heavy<br> book across her lap, her mouth a little open with surprise,<br> thinking that during the lean months at Tara she had done a man's<br> work and done it well. She had been brought up to believe that a<br> woman alone could accomplish nothing, yet she had managed the<br> plantation without men to help her until Will came. Why, why, her<br> mind stuttered, I believe women could manage everything in the<br> world without men's help--except having babies, and God knows, no<br> woman in her right mind would have babies if she could help it.<br><br> With the idea that she was as capable as a man came a sudden rush<br> of pride and a violent longing to prove it, to make money for<br> herself as men made money. Money which would be her own, which she<br> would neither have to ask for nor account for to any man.<br><br> ‘I wish I had money enough to buy that mill myself,’ she said aloud<br> and sighed. ‘I'd sure make it hum. And I wouldn't let even one<br> splinter go out on credit.’<br><br> She sighed again. There was nowhere she could get any money, so<br> the idea was out of the question. Frank would simply have to<br> collect this money owing him and buy the mill. It was a sure way<br> to make money, and when he got the mill, she would certainly find<br> some way to make him be more businesslike in its operation than he<br> had been with the store.<br><br> She pulled a back page out of the ledger and began copying the list<br> of debtors who had made no payments in several months. She'd take<br> the matter up with Frank just as soon as she reached home. She'd<br> make him realize that these people had to pay their bills even if<br> they were old friends, even if it did embarrass him to press them<br> for money. That would probably upset Frank, for he was timid and<br> fond of the approbation of his friends. He was so thin skinned<br> he'd rather lose the money than be businesslike about collecting<br> it.<br><br> And he'd probably tell her that no one had any money with which to<br> pay him. Well, perhaps that was true. Poverty was certainly no<br> news to her. But nearly everybody had saved some silver or jewelry<br> or was hanging on to a little real estate. Frank could take them<br> in lieu of cash.<br><br> She could imagine how Frank would moan when she broached such an<br> idea to him. Take the jewelry and property of his friends! Well,<br> she shrugged, he can moan all he likes. I'm going to tell him that<br> he may be willing to stay poor for friendship's sake but I'm not.<br> Frank will never get anywhere if he doesn't get up some gumption.<br> And he's got to get somewhere! He's got to make money, even if<br> I've got to wear the pants in the family to make him do.<br><br> She was writing busily, her face screwed up with the effort, her<br> tongue clamped between her teeth, when the front door opened and a<br> great draft of cold wind swept the store. A tall man came into the<br> dingy room walking with a light Indian-like tread, and looking up<br> she saw Rhett Butler.<br><br> He was resplendent in new clothes and a greatcoat with a dashing<br> cape thrown back from his heavy shoulders. His tall hat was off in<br> a deep bow when her eyes met his and his hand went to the bosom of<br> a spotless pleated shirt. His white teeth gleamed startlingly<br> against his brown face and his bold eyes raked her.<br><br> ‘My dear Mrs. Kennedy,’ he said, walking toward her. ‘My very dear<br> Mrs. Kennedy!’ and he broke into a loud merry laugh.<br><br> At first she was as startled as if a ghost had invaded the store<br> and then, hastily removing her foot from beneath her, she stiffened<br> her spine and gave him a cold stare.<br><br> ‘What are you doing here?’<br><br> ‘I called on Miss Pittypat and learned of your marriage and so I<br> hastened here to congratulate you.’<br><br> The memory of her humiliation at his hands made her go crimson with<br> shame.<br><br> ‘I don't see how you have the gall to face me!’ she cried.<br><br> ‘On the contrary! How have you the gall to face me?’<br><br> ‘Oh, you are the most--’<br><br> ‘Shall we let the bugles sing truce?’ he smiled down at her, a wide<br> flashing smile that had impudence in it but no shame for his own<br> actions or condemnation for hers. In spite of herself, she had to<br> smile too, but it was a wry, uncomfortable smile.<br><br> ‘What a pity they didn't hang you!’<br><br> ‘Others share your feeling, I fear. Come, Scarlett, relax. You<br> look like you'd swallowed a ramrod and it isn't becoming. Surely,<br> you've had time to recover from my--er--my little joke.’<br><br> ‘Joke? Ha! I'll never get over it!’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, you will. You are just putting on this indignant front<br> because you think it's proper and respectable. May I sit down?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> He sank into a chair beside her and grinned.<br><br> ‘I hear you couldn't even wait two weeks for me,’ he said and gave<br> a mock sigh. ‘How fickle is woman!’<br><br> When she did not reply he continued.<br><br> ‘Tell me, Scarlett, just between friends--between very old and very<br> intimate friends--wouldn't it have been wiser to wait until I got<br> out of jail? Or are the charms of wedlock with old Frank Kennedy<br> more alluring than illicit relations with me?’<br><br> As always when his mockery aroused wrath within her, wrath fought<br> with laughter at his impudence.<br><br> ‘Don't be absurd.’<br><br> ‘And would you mind satisfying my curiosity on one point which has<br> bothered me for some time? Did you have no womanly repugnance, no<br> delicate shrinking from marrying not just one man but two for whom<br> you had no love or even affection? Or have I been misinformed<br> about the delicacy of our Southern womanhood?’<br><br> ‘Rhett!’<br><br> ‘I have my answer. I always felt that women had a hardness and<br> endurance unknown to men, despite the pretty idea taught me in<br> childhood that women are frail, tender, sensitive creatures. But<br> after all, according to the Continental code of etiquette, it's<br> very bad form for husband and wife to love each other. Very bad<br> taste, indeed. I always felt that the Europeans had the right idea<br> in that matter. Marry for convenience and love for pleasure. A<br> sensible system, don't you think? You are closer to the old<br> country than I thought.’<br><br> How pleasant it would be to shout at him: ‘I did not marry for<br> convenience!’ But unfortunately, Rhett had her there and any<br> protest of injured innocence would only bring more barbed remarks<br> from him.<br><br> ‘How you do run on,’ she said coolly. Anxious to change the<br> subject, she asked: ‘How did you ever get out of jail?’<br><br> ‘Oh, that!’ he answered, making an airy gesture. ‘Not much<br> trouble. They let me out this morning. I employed a delicate<br> system of blackmail on a friend in Washington who is quite high in<br> the councils of the Federal government. A splendid fellow--one of<br> the staunch Union patriots from whom I used to buy muskets and hoop<br> skirts for the Confederacy. When my distressing predicament was<br> brought to his attention in the right way, he hastened to use his<br> influence, and so I was released. Influence is everything, and<br> guilt or innocence merely an academic question.’<br><br> ‘I'll take oath you weren't innocent.’<br><br> ‘No, now that I am free of the toils, I'll frankly admit that I'm<br> as guilty as Cain. I did kill the nigger. He was uppity to a<br> lady, and what else could a Southern gentleman do? And while I'm<br> confessing, I must admit that I shot a Yankee cavalryman after some<br> words in a barroom. I was not charged with that peccadillo, so<br> perhaps some other poor devil has been hanged for it, long since.’<br><br> He was so blithe about his murders her blood chilled. Words of<br> moral indignation rose to her lips but suddenly she remembered the<br> Yankee who lay under the tangle of scuppernong vines at Tara. He<br> had not been on her conscience any more than a roach upon which she<br> might have stepped. She could not sit in judgment on Rhett when<br> she was as guilty as he.<br><br> ‘And, as I seem to be making a clean breast of it, I must tell you,<br> in strictest confidence (that means, don't tell Miss Pittypat!)<br> that I did have the money, safe in a bank in Liverpool.’<br><br> ‘The money?’<br><br> ‘Yes, the money the Yankees were so curious about. Scarlett, it<br> wasn't altogether meanness that kept me from giving you the money<br> you wanted. If I'd drawn a draft they could have traced it somehow<br> and I doubt if you'd have gotten a cent. My only hope lay in doing<br> nothing. I knew the money was pretty safe, for if worst came to<br> worst, if they had located it and tried to take it away from me, I<br> would have named every Yankee patriot who sold me bullets and<br> machinery during the war. Then there would have been a stink, for<br> some of them are high up in Washington now. In fact, it was my<br> threat to unbosom my conscience about them that got me out of jail.<br> I--’<br><br> ‘Do you mean you--you actually have the Confederate gold?’<br><br> ‘Not all of it. Good Heavens, no! There must be fifty or more ex-<br> blockaders who have plenty salted away in Nassau and England and<br> Canada. We will be pretty unpopular with the Confederates who<br> weren't as slick as we were. I have got close to half a million.<br> Just think, Scarlett, a half-million dollars, if you'd only<br> restrained your fiery nature and not rushed into wedlock again!’<br><br> A half-million dollars. She felt a pang of almost physical<br> sickness at the thought of so much money. His jeering words passed<br> over her head and she did not even hear them. It was hard to<br> believe there was so much money in all this bitter and poverty-<br> stricken world. So much money, so very much money, and someone<br> else had it, someone who took it lightly and didn't need it. And<br> she had only a sick elderly husband and this dirty, piddling,<br> little store between her and a hostile world. It wasn't fair that<br> a reprobate like Rhett Butler should have so much and she, who<br> carried so heavy a load, should have so little. She hated him,<br> sitting there in his dandified attire, taunting her. Well, she<br> wouldn't swell his conceit by complimenting him on his cleverness.<br> She longed viciously for sharp words with which to cut him.<br><br> ‘I suppose you think it's honest to keep the Confederate money.<br> Well, it isn't. It's plain out and out stealing and you know it.<br> I wouldn't have that on my conscience.’<br><br> ‘My! How sour the grapes are today!’ he exclaimed, screwing up his<br> face. ‘And just whom am I stealing from?’<br><br> She was silent, trying to think just whom indeed. After all, he<br> had only done what Frank had done on a small scale.<br><br> ‘Half the money is honestly mine,’ he continued, ‘honestly made<br> with the aid of honest Union patriots who were willing to sell out<br> the Union behind its back--for one-hundred-per-cent profit on their<br> goods. Part I made out of my little investment in cotton at the<br> beginning of the war, the cotton I bought cheap and sold for a<br> dollar a pound when the British mills were crying for it. Part I<br> got from food speculation. Why should I let the Yankees have the<br> fruits of my labor? But the rest did belong to the Confederacy.<br> It came from Confederate cotton which I managed to run through the<br> blockade and sell in Liverpool at sky-high prices. The cotton was<br> given me in good faith to buy leather and rifles and machinery<br> with. And it was taken by me in good faith to buy the same. My<br> orders were to leave the gold in English banks, under my own name,<br> in order that my credit would be good. You remember when the<br> blockade tightened, I couldn't get a boat out of any Confederate<br> port or into one, so there the money stayed in England. What should<br> I have done? Drawn out all that gold from English banks, like a<br> simpleton, and tried to run it into Wilmington? And let the Yankees<br> capture it? Was it my fault that the blockade got too tight? Was<br> it my fault that our Cause failed? The money belonged to the<br> Confederacy. Well, there is no Confederacy now--though you'd never<br> know it, to hear some people talk. Whom shall I give the money to?<br> The Yankee government? I should so hate for people to think me a<br> thief.’<br><br> He removed a leather case from his pocket, extracted a long cigar<br> and smelled it approvingly, meanwhile watching her with pseudo<br> anxiety as if he hung on her words.<br><br> Plague take him, she thought, he's always one jump ahead of me.<br> There is always something wrong with his arguments but I never can<br> put my finger on just what it is.<br><br> ‘You might,’ she said with dignity, ‘distribute it to those who<br> are in need. The Confederacy is gone but there are plenty of<br> Confederates and their families who are starving.’<br><br> He threw back his bead and laughed rudely.<br><br> ‘You are never so charming or so absurd as when you are airing some<br> hypocrisy like that,’ he cried in frank enjoyment. ‘Always tell<br> the truth, Scarlett. You can't lie. The Irish are the poorest<br> liars in the world. Come now, be frank. You never gave a damn<br> about the late lamented Confederacy and you care less about the<br> starving Confederates. You'd scream in protest if I even suggested<br> giving away all the money unless I started off by giving you the<br> lion's share.’<br><br> ‘I don't want your money,’ she began, trying to be coldly dignified.<br><br> ‘Oh, don't you! Your palm is itching to beat the band this minute.<br> If I showed you a quarter, you'd leap on it.’<br><br> ‘If you have come here to insult me and laugh at my poverty, I will<br> wish you good day,’ she retorted, trying to rid her lap of the<br> heavy ledger so she might rise and make her words more impressive.<br> Instantly, he was on his feet bending over her, laughing as he<br> pushed her back into her chair.<br><br> ‘When will you ever get over losing your temper when you hear the<br> truth? You never mind speaking the truth about other people, so<br> why should you mind hearing it about yourself? I'm not insulting<br> you. I think acquisitiveness is a very fine quality.’<br><br> She was not sure what acquisitiveness meant but as he praised it<br> she felt slightly mollified.<br><br> ‘I didn't come to gloat over your poverty but to wish you long life<br> and happiness in your marriage. By the way, what did sister Sue<br> think of your larceny?’<br><br> ‘My what?’<br><br> ‘Your stealing Frank from under her nose.’<br><br> ‘I did not--’<br><br> ‘Well, we won't quibble about the word. What did she say?’<br><br> ‘She said nothing,’ said Scarlett. His eyes danced as they gave<br> her the lie.<br><br> ‘How unselfish of her. Now, let's hear about your poverty. Surely<br> I have the right to know, after your little trip out to the jail<br> not long ago. Hasn't Frank as much money as you hoped?’<br><br> There was no evading his impudence. Either she would have to put<br> up with it or ask him to leave. And now she did not want him to<br> leave. His words were barbed but they were the barbs of truth. He<br> knew what she had done and why she had done it and he did not seem<br> to think the less of her for it. And though his questions were<br> unpleasantly blunt, they seemed actuated by a friendly interest.<br> He was one person to whom she could tell the truth. That would be<br> a relief, for it had been so long since she had told anyone the<br> truth about herself and her motives. Whenever she spoke her mind<br> everyone seemed to be shocked. Talking to Rhett was comparable<br> only to one thing, the feeling of ease and comfort afforded by a<br> pair of old slippers after dancing in a pair too tight.<br><br> ‘Didn't you get the money for the taxes? Don't tell me the wolf is<br> still at the door of Tara.’ There was a different tone in his<br> voice.<br><br> She looked up to meet his dark eyes and caught an expression which<br> startled and puzzled her at first, and then made her suddenly<br> smile, a sweet and charming smile which was seldom on her face<br> these days. What a perverse wretch he was, but how nice he could<br> be at times! She knew now that the real reason for his call was<br> not to tease her but to make sure she had gotten the money for<br> which she had been so desperate. She knew now that he had hurried<br> to her as soon as he was released, without the slightest appearance<br> of hurry, to lend her the money if she still needed it. And yet he<br> would torment and insult her and deny that such was his intent,<br> should she accuse him. He was quite beyond all comprehension. Did<br> he really care about her, more than he was willing to admit? Or<br> did he have some other motive? Probably the latter, she thought.<br> But who could tell? He did such strange things sometimes.<br><br> ‘No,’ she said, ‘the wolf isn't at the door any longer. I--I got<br> the money.’<br><br> ‘But not without a struggle, I'll warrant. Did you manage to<br> restrain yourself until you got the wedding ring on your finger?’<br><br> She tried not to smile at his accurate summing up of her conduct<br> but she could not help dimpling. He seated himself again,<br> sprawling his long legs comfortably.<br><br> ‘Well, tell me about your poverty. Did Frank, the brute, mislead<br> you about his prospects? He should be soundly thrashed for taking<br> advantage of a helpless female. Come, Scarlett, tell me<br> everything. You should have no secrets from me. Surely, I know<br> the worst about you.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, you're the worst--well, I don't know what! No, he<br> didn't exactly fool me but--’ Suddenly it became a pleasure to<br> unburden herself. ‘Rhett, if Frank would just collect the money<br> people owe him, I wouldn't be worried about anything. But, Rhett,<br> fifty people owe him and he won't press them. He's so thin<br> skinned. He says a gentleman can't do that to another gentleman.<br> And it may be months and may be never before we get the money.’<br><br> ‘Well, what of it? Haven't you enough to eat on until he does<br> collect?’<br><br> ‘Yes, but--well, as a matter of fact, I could use a little money<br> right now.’ Her eyes brightened as she thought of the mill.<br> ‘Perhaps--’<br><br> ‘What for? More taxes?’<br><br> ‘Is that any of your business?’<br><br> ‘Yes, because you are getting ready to touch me for a loan. Oh, I<br> know all the approaches. And I'll lend it to you--without, my dear<br> Mrs. Kennedy, that charming collateral you offered me a short while<br> ago. Unless, of course, you insist.’<br><br> ‘You are the coarsest--’<br><br> ‘Not at all. I merely wanted to set your mind at ease. I knew<br> you'd be worried about that point. Not much worried but a little.<br> And I'm willing to lend you the money. But I do want to know how<br> you are going to spend it. I have that right, I believe. If it's<br> to buy you pretty frocks or a carriage, take it with my blessing.<br> But if it's to buy a new pair of breeches for Ashley Wilkes, I fear<br> I must decline to lend it.’<br><br> She was hot with sudden rage and she stuttered until words came.<br><br> ‘Ashley Wilkes has never taken a cent from me! I couldn't make him<br> take a cent if he were starving! You don't understand him, how<br> honorable, how proud he is! Of course, you can't understand him,<br> being what you are--’<br><br> ‘Don't let's begin calling names. I could call you a few that<br> would match any you could think of for me. You forget that I have<br> been keeping up with you through Miss Pittypat, and the dear soul<br> tells all she knows to any sympathetic listener. I know that<br> Ashley has been at Tara ever since he came home from Rock Island.<br> I know that you have even put up with having his wife around, which<br> must have been a strain on you.’<br><br> ‘Ashley is--’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes,’ he said, waving his hand negligently. ‘Ashley is too<br> sublime for my earthy comprehension. But please don't forget I was<br> an interested witness to your tender scene with him at Twelve Oaks<br> and something tells me he hasn't changed since then. And neither<br> have you. He didn't cut so sublime a figure that day, if I<br> remember rightly. And I don't think the figure he cuts now is much<br> better. Why doesn't he take his family and get out and find work?<br> And stop living at Tara? Of course, it's just a whim of mine, but<br> I don't intend to lend you a cent for Tara to help support him.<br> Among men, there's a very unpleasant name for men who permit women<br> to support them.’<br><br> ‘How dare you say such things? He's been working like a field<br> hand!’ For all her rage, her heart was wrung by the memory of<br> Ashley splitting fence rails.<br><br> ‘And worth his weight in gold, I dare say. What a hand he must be<br> with the manure and--’<br><br> ‘He's--’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, I know. Let's grant that he does the best he can but I<br> don't imagine he's much help. You'll never make a farm hand out of<br> a Wilkes--or anything else that's useful. The breed is purely<br> ornamental. Now, quiet your ruffled feathers and overlook my<br> boorish remarks about the proud and honorable Ashley. Strange how<br> these illusions will persist even in women as hard headed as you<br> are. How much money do you want and what do you want it for?’<br><br> When she did not answer he repeated:<br><br> ‘What do you want it for? And see if you can manage to tell me the<br> truth. It will do as well as a lie. In fact, better, for if you<br> lie to me, I'll be sure to find it out, and think how embarrassing<br> that would be. Always remember this, Scarlett, I can stand<br> anything from you but a lie--your dislike for me, your tempers, all<br> your vixenish ways, but not a lie. Now what do you want it for?’<br><br> Raging as she was at his attack on Ashley, she would have given<br> anything to spit on him and throw his offer of money proudly into<br> his mocking face. For a moment she almost did, but the cold hand<br> of common sense held her back. She swallowed her anger with poor<br> grace and tried to assume an expression of pleasant dignity. He<br> leaned back in his chair, stretching his legs toward the stove.<br><br> ‘If there's one thing in the world that gives me more amusement<br> than anything else,’ he remarked, ‘it's the sight of your mental<br> struggles when a matter of principle is laid up against something<br> practical like money. Of course, I know the practical in you will<br> always win, but I keep hanging around to see if your better nature<br> won't triumph some day. And when that day comes I shall pack my<br> bag and leave Atlanta forever. There are too many women whose<br> better natures are always triumphing. . . . Well, let's get back<br> to business. How much and what for?’<br><br> ‘I don't know quite how much I'll need,’ she said sulkily. ‘But I<br> want to buy a sawmill--and I think I can get it cheap. And I'll<br> need two wagons and two mules. I want good mules, too. And a<br> horse and buggy for my own use.’<br><br> ‘A sawmill?’<br><br> ‘Yes, and if you'll lend me the money, I'll give you a half-<br> interest in it.’<br><br> ‘Whatever would I do with a sawmill?’<br><br> ‘Make money! We can make loads of money. Or I'll pay you interest<br> on the loan--let's see, what is good interest?’<br><br> ‘Fifty per cent is considered very fine.’<br><br> ‘Fifty--oh, but you are joking! Stop laughing, you devil. I'm<br> serious.’<br><br> ‘That's why I'm laughing. I wonder if anyone but me realizes what<br> goes on in that head back of your deceptively sweet face.’<br><br> ‘Well, who cares? Listen, Rhett, and see if this doesn't sound<br> like good business to you. Frank told me about this man who has a<br> sawmill, a little one out Peachtree road, and he wants to sell it.<br> He's got to have cash money pretty quick and he'll sell it cheap.<br> There aren't many sawmills around here now, and the way people are<br> rebuilding--why, we could sell lumber sky high. The man will stay<br> and run the mill for a wage. Frank told me about it. Frank would<br> buy the mill himself if he had the money. I guess he was intending<br> buying it with the money he gave me for the taxes.’<br><br> ‘Poor Frank! What is he going to say when you tell him you've<br> bought it yourself right out from under him? And how are you going<br> to explain my lending you the money without compromising your<br> reputation?’<br><br> Scarlett had given no thought to this, so intent was she upon the<br> money the mill would bring in.<br><br> ‘Well, I just won't tell him.’<br><br> ‘He'll know you didn't pick it off a bush.’<br><br> ‘I'll tell him--why, yes, I'll tell him I sold you my diamond<br> earbobs. And I will give them to you, too. That'll be my collat--<br> my whatchucallit.’<br><br> ‘I wouldn't take your earbobs.’<br><br> ‘I don't want them. I don't like them. They aren't really mine,<br> anyway.’<br><br> ‘Whose are they?’<br><br> Her mind went swiftly back to the still hot noon with the country<br> hush deep about Tara and the dead man in blue sprawled in the hall.<br><br> ‘They were left with me--by someone who's dead. They're mine all<br> right. Take them. I don't want them. I'd rather have the money<br> for them.’<br><br> ‘Good Lord!’ he cried impatiently. ‘Don't you ever think of<br> anything but money?’<br><br> ‘No,’ she replied frankly, turning hard green eyes upon him. ‘And<br> if you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't either. I've found<br> out that money is the most important thing in the world and, as God<br> is my witness, I don't ever intend to be without it again.’<br><br> She remembered the hot sun, the soft red earth under her sick head,<br> the niggery smell of the cabin behind the ruins of Twelve Oaks,<br> remembered the refrain her heart had beaten: ‘I'll never be hungry<br> again. I'll never be hungry again.’<br><br> ‘I'm going to have money some day, lots of it, so I can have<br> anything I want to eat. And then there'll never be any hominy or<br> dried peas on my table. And I'm going to have pretty clothes and<br> all of them are going to be silk--’<br><br> ‘All?’<br><br> ‘All,’ she said shortly, not even troubling to blush at his<br> implication. ‘I'm going to have money enough so the Yankees can<br> never take Tara away from me. And I'm going to have a new roof for<br> Tara and a new barn and fine mules for plowing and more cotton than<br> you ever saw. And Wade isn't ever going to know what it means to<br> do without the things he needs. Never! He's going to have<br> everything in the world. And all my family, they aren't ever going<br> to be hungry again. I mean it. Every word. You don't understand,<br> you're such a selfish hound. You've never had the Carpetbaggers<br> trying to drive you out. You've never been cold and ragged and had<br> to break your back to keep from starving!’<br><br> He said quietly: ‘I was in the Confederate Army for eight months.<br> I don't know any better place for starving.’<br><br> ‘The army! Bah! You've never had to pick cotton and weed corn.<br> You've-- Don't you laugh at me!’<br><br> His hands were on hers again as her voice rose harshly.<br><br> ‘I wasn't laughing at you. I was laughing at the difference in<br> what you look and what you really are. And I was remembering the<br> first time I ever saw you, at the barbecue at the Wilkes'. You had<br> on a green dress and little green slippers, and you were knee deep<br> in men and quite full of yourself. I'll wager you didn't know then<br> how many pennies were in a dollar. There was only one idea in your<br> whole mind then and that was ensnaring Ash--’<br><br> She jerked her hands away from him.<br><br> ‘Rhett, if we are to get on at all, you'll have to stop talking<br> about Ashley Wilkes. We'll always fall out about him, because you<br> can't understand him.’<br><br> ‘I suppose you understand him like a book,’ said Rhett maliciously.<br> ‘No, Scarlett, if I am to lend you the money I reserve the right to<br> discuss Ashley Wilkes in any terms I care to. I waive the right to<br> collect interest on my loan but not that right. And there are a<br> number of things about that young man I'd like to know.’<br><br> ‘I do not have to discuss him with you,’ she answered shortly.<br><br> ‘Oh, but you do! I hold the purse strings, you see. Some day when<br> you are rich, you can have the power to do the same to others. . . .<br> It's obvious that you still care about him--’<br><br> ‘I do not.’<br><br> ‘Oh, it's so obvious from the way you rush to his defense. You--’<br><br> ‘I won't stand having my friends sneered at.’<br><br> ‘Well, we'll let that pass for the moment. Does he still care for<br> you or did Rock Island make him forget? Or perhaps he's learned to<br> appreciate what a jewel of a wife he has?’<br><br> At the mention of Melanie, Scarlett began to breathe hard and could<br> scarcely restrain herself from crying out the whole story, that<br> only honor kept Ashley with Melanie. She opened her mouth to speak<br> and then closed it.<br><br> ‘Oh. So he still hasn't enough sense to appreciate Mrs. Wilkes?<br> And the rigors of prison didn't dim his ardor for you?’<br><br> ‘I see no need to discuss the subject.’<br><br> ‘I wish to discuss it,’ said Rhett. There was a low note in his<br> voice which Scarlett did not understand but did not like to hear.<br> ‘And, by God, I will discuss it and I expect you to answer me. So<br> he's still in love with you?’<br><br> ‘Well, what if he is?’ cried Scarlett, goaded. ‘I don't care to<br> discuss him with you because you can't understand him or his kind<br> of love. The only kind of love you know about is just--well, the<br> kind you carry on with creatures like that Watling woman.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ said Rhett softly. ‘So I am only capable of carnal lusts?’<br><br> ‘Well, you know it's true.’<br><br> ‘Now I appreciate your hesitance in discussing the matter with me.<br> My unclean hands and lips besmirch the purity of his love.’<br><br> ‘Well, yes--something like that.’<br><br> ‘I'm interested in this pure love--’<br><br> ‘Don't be so nasty, Rhett Butler. If you are vile enough to think<br> there's ever been anything wrong between us--’<br><br> ‘Oh, the thought never entered my head, really. That's why it all<br> interests me. Just why hasn't there been anything wrong between<br> you?’<br><br> ‘If you think that Ashley would--’<br><br> ‘Ah, so it's Ashley, and not you, who has fought the fight for<br> purity. Really, Scarlett, you should not give yourself away so<br> easily.’<br><br> Scarlett looked into his smooth unreadable face in confusion and<br> indignation.<br><br> ‘We won't go any further with this and I don't want your money.<br> So, get out!’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, you do want my money and, as we've gone this far, why<br> stop? Surely there can be no harm in discussing so chaste an idyl--<br> when there hasn't been anything wrong. So Ashley loves you for<br> your mind, your soul, your nobility of character?’<br><br> Scarlett writhed at his words. Of course, Ashley loved her for<br> just these things. It was this knowledge that made life endurable,<br> this knowledge that Ashley, bound by honor, loved her from afar for<br> beautiful things deep buried in her that he alone could see. But<br> they did not seem so beautiful when dragged to the light by Rhett,<br> especially in that deceptively smooth voice that covered sarcasm.<br><br> ‘It gives me back my boyish ideals to know that such a love can<br> exist in this naughty world,’ he continued. ‘So there's no touch<br> of the flesh in his love for you? It would be the same if you were<br> ugly and didn't have that white skin? And if you didn't have those<br> green eyes which make a man wonder just what you would do if he<br> took you in his arms? And a way of swaying your hips, that's an<br> allurement to any man under ninety? And those lips which are--<br> well, I mustn't let my carnal lusts obtrude. Ashley sees none of<br> these things? Or if he sees them, they move him not at all?’<br><br> Unbidden, Scarlett's mind went back to that day in the orchard when<br> Ashley's arms shook as he held her, when his mouth was hot on hers<br> as if he would never let her go. She went crimson at the memory<br> and her blush was not lost on Rhett.<br><br> ‘So,’ he said and there was a vibrant note almost like anger in his<br> voice. ‘I see. He loves you for your mind alone.’<br><br> How dare he pry with dirty fingers, making the one beautiful sacred<br> thing in her life seem vile? Coolly, determinedly, he was breaking<br> down the last of her reserves and the information he wanted was<br> forthcoming.<br><br> ‘Yes, he does!’ she cried, pushing back the memory of Ashley's<br> lips.<br><br> ‘My dear, he doesn't even know you've got a mind. If it was your<br> mind that attracted him, he would not need to struggle against you,<br> as he must have done to keep this love so--shall we say 'holy'? He<br> could rest easily for, after all, a man can admire a woman's mind<br> and soul and still be an honorable gentleman and true to his wife.<br> But it must be difficult for him to reconcile the honor of the<br> Wilkeses with coveting your body as he does.’<br><br> ‘You judge everybody's mind by your own vile one!’<br><br> ‘Oh, I've never denied coveting you, if that's what you mean. But,<br> thank God, I'm not bothered about matters of honor. What I want I<br> take if I can get it, and so I wrestle neither with angels nor<br> devils. What a merry hell you must have made for Ashley! Almost I<br> can be sorry for him.’<br><br> ‘I--I make a hell for him?’<br><br> ‘Yes, you! There you are, a constant temptation to him, but like<br> most of his breed he prefers what passes in these parts as honor to<br> any amount of love. And it looks to me as if the poor devil now<br> had neither love nor honor to warm himself!’<br><br> ‘He has love! . . . I mean, he loves me!’<br><br> ‘Does he? Then answer me this and we are through for the day and<br> you can take the money and throw it in the gutter for all I care.’<br><br> Rhett rose to his feet and threw his half-smoked cigar into the<br> spittoon. There was about his movements the same pagan freedom and<br> leashed power Scarlett had noted that night Atlanta fell, something<br> sinister and a little frightening. ‘If he loved you, then why in<br> hell did he permit you to come to Atlanta to get the tax money?<br> Before I'd let a woman I loved do that, I'd--’<br><br> ‘He didn't know! He had no idea that I--’<br><br> ‘Doesn't it occur to you that he should have known?’ There was<br> barely suppressed savagery in his voice. ‘Loving you as you say he<br> does, he should have known just what you would do when you were<br> desperate. He should have killed you rather than let you come up<br> here--and to me, of all people! God in Heaven!’<br><br> ‘But he didn't know!’<br><br> ‘If he didn't guess it without being told, he'll never know<br> anything about you and your precious mind.’<br><br> How unfair he was! As if Ashley was a mind reader! As if Ashley<br> could have stopped her, even had he known! But, she knew suddenly,<br> Ashley could have stopped her. The faintest intimation from him,<br> in the orchard, that some day things might be different and she<br> would never have thought of going to Rhett. A word of tenderness,<br> even a parting caress when she was getting on the train, would have<br> held her back. But he had only talked of honor. Yet--was Rhett<br> right? Should Ashley have known her mind? Swiftly she put the<br> disloyal thought from her. Of course, he didn't suspect. Ashley<br> would never suspect that she would even think of doing anything so<br> immoral. Ashley was too fine to have such thoughts. Rhett was<br> just trying to spoil her love. He was trying to tear down what was<br> most precious to her. Some day, she thought viciously, when the<br> store was on its feet and the mill doing nicely and she had money,<br> she would make Rhett Butler pay for the misery and humiliation he<br> was causing her.<br><br> He was standing over her, looking down at her, faintly amused. The<br> emotion which had stirred him was gone.<br><br> ‘What does it all matter to you anyway?’ she asked. ‘It's my<br> business and Ashley's and not yours.’<br><br> He shrugged.<br><br> ‘Only this. I have a deep and impersonal admiration for your<br> endurance, Scarlett, and I do not like to see your spirit crushed<br> beneath too many millstones. There's Tara. That's a man-sized job<br> in itself. There's your sick father added on. He'll never be any<br> help to you. And the girls and the darkies. And now you've taken<br> on a husband and probably Miss Pittypat, too. You've enough<br> burdens without Ashley Wilkes and his family on your hands.’<br><br> ‘He's not on my hands. He helps--’<br><br> ‘Oh, for God's sake,’ he said impatiently. ‘Don't let's have any<br> more of that. He's no help. He's on your hands and he'll be on<br> them, or on somebody's, till he dies. Personally, I'm sick of him<br> as a topic of conversation. . . . How much money do you want?’<br><br> Vituperative words rushed to her lips. After all his insults,<br> after dragging from her those things which were most precious to<br> her and trampling on them, he still thought she would take his<br> money!<br><br> But the words were checked unspoken. How wonderful it would be to<br> scorn his offer and order him out of the store! But only the truly<br> rich and the truly secure could afford this luxury. So long as she<br> was poor, just so long would she have to endure such scenes as<br> this. But when she was rich--oh, what a beautiful warming thought<br> that was!--when she was rich, she wouldn't stand anything she<br> didn't like, do without anything she desired or even be polite to<br> people unless they pleased her.<br><br> I shall tell them all to go to Halifax, she thought, and Rhett<br> Butler will be the first one!<br><br> The pleasure in the thought brought a sparkle into her green eyes<br> and a half-smile to her lips. Rhett smiled too.<br><br> ‘You're a pretty person, Scarlett,’ he said. ‘Especially when you<br> are meditating devilment. And just for the sight of that dimple<br> I'll buy you a baker's dozen of mules if you want them.’<br><br> The front door opened and the counter boy entered, picking his<br> teeth with a quill. Scarlett rose, pulled her shawl about her and<br> tied her bonnet strings firmly under her chin. Her mind was made<br> up.<br><br> ‘Are you busy this afternoon? Can you come with me now?’ she<br> asked.<br><br> ‘Where?’<br><br> ‘I want you to drive to the mill with me. I promised Frank I<br> wouldn't drive out of town by myself.’<br><br> ‘To the mill in this rain?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I want to buy that mill now, before you change your mind.’<br><br> He laughed so loudly the boy behind the counter started and looked<br> at him curiously.<br><br> ‘Have you forgotten you are married? Mrs. Kennedy can't afford to<br> be seen driving out into the country with that Butler reprobate,<br> who isn't received in the best parlors. Have you forgotten your<br> reputation?’<br><br> ‘Reputation, fiddle-dee-dee! I want that mill before you change<br> your mind or Frank finds out that I'm buying it. Don't be a slow<br> poke, Rhett. What's a little rain? Let's hurry.’<br><br> <br><br> That sawmill! Frank groaned every time he thought of it, cursing<br> himself for ever mentioning it to her. It was bad enough for her<br> to sell her earrings to Captain Butler (of all people!) and buy the<br> mill without even consulting her own husband about it, but it was<br> worse still that she did not turn it over to him to operate. That<br> looked bad. As if she did not trust him or his judgment.<br><br> Frank, in common with all men he knew, felt that a wife should be<br> guided by her husband's superior knowledge, should accept his<br> opinions in full and have none of her own. He would have given<br> most women their own way. Women were such funny little creatures<br> and it never hurt to humor their small whims. Mild and gentle by<br> nature, it was not in him to deny a wife much. He would have<br> enjoyed gratifying the foolish notions of some soft little person<br> and scolding her lovingly for her stupidity and extravagance. But<br> the things Scarlett set her mind on were unthinkable.<br><br> That sawmill, for example. It was the shock of his life when she<br> told him with a sweet smile, in answer to his questions, that she<br> intended to run it herself. ‘Go into the lumber business myself,’<br> was the way she put it. Frank would never forget the horror of<br> that moment. Go into business for herself! It was unthinkable.<br> There were no women in business in Atlanta. In fact, Frank had<br> never heard of a woman in business anywhere. If women were so<br> unfortunate as to be compelled to make a little money to assist<br> their families in these hard times, they made it in quiet womanly<br> ways--baking as Mrs. Merriwether was doing, or painting china and<br> sewing and keeping boarders, like Mrs. Elsing and Fanny, or<br> teaching school like Mrs. Meade or giving music lessons like Mrs.<br> Bonnell. These ladies made money but they kept themselves at home<br> while they did it, as a woman should. But for a woman to leave the<br> protection of her home and venture out into the rough world of men,<br> competing with them in business, rubbing shoulders with them, being<br> exposed to insult and gossip. . . . Especially when she wasn't<br> forced to do it, when she had a husband amply able to provide for<br> her!<br><br> Frank had hoped she was only teasing or playing a joke on him, a<br> joke of questionable taste, but he soon found she meant what she<br> said. She did operate the sawmill. She rose earlier than he did<br> to drive out Peachtree road and frequently did not come home until<br> long after he had locked up the store and returned to Aunt Pitty's<br> for supper. She drove the long miles to the mill with only the<br> disapproving Uncle Peter to protect her and the woods were full of<br> free niggers and Yankee riffraff. Frank couldn't go with her, the<br> store took all of his time, but when he protested, she said<br> shortly: ‘If I don't keep an eye on that slick scamp, Johnson,<br> he'll steal my lumber and sell it and put the money in his pocket.<br> When I can get a good man to run the mill for me, then I won't have<br> to go out there so often. Then I can spend my time in town selling<br> lumber.’<br><br> Selling lumber in town! That was worst of all. She frequently did<br> take a day off from the mill and peddle lumber and, on those days,<br> Frank wished he could hide in the dark back room of his store and<br> see no one. His wife selling lumber!<br><br> And people were talking terrible about her. Probably about him<br> too, for permitting her to behave in so unwomanly a fashion. It<br> embarrassed him to face his customers over the counter and hear<br> them say: ‘I saw Mrs. Kennedy a few minutes ago over at . . .’<br> Everyone took pains to tell him what she did. Everyone was talking<br> about what happened over where the new hotel was being built.<br> Scarlett had driven up just as Tommy Wellburn was buying some<br> lumber from another man and she climbed down out of the buggy among<br> the rough Irish masons who were laying the foundations, and told<br> Tommy briefly that he was being cheated. She said her lumber was<br> better and cheaper too, and to prove it she ran up a long column of<br> figures in her head and gave him an estimate then and there. It<br> was bad enough that she had intruded herself among strange rough<br> workmen, but it was still worse for a woman to show publicly that<br> she could do mathematics like that. When Tommy accepted her<br> estimate and gave her the order, Scarlett had not taken her<br> departure speedily and meekly but had idled about, talking to<br> Johnnie Gallegher, the foreman of the Irish workers, a hard-bitten<br> little gnome of a man who had a very bad reputation. The town<br> talked about it for weeks.<br><br> On top of everything else, she was actually making money out of the<br> mill, and no man could feel right about a wife who succeeded in so<br> unwomanly an activity. Nor did she turn over the money or any part<br> of it to him to use in the store. Most of it went to Tara and she<br> wrote interminable letters to Will Benteen telling him just how it<br> should be spent. Furthermore, she told Frank that if the repairs<br> at Tara could ever be completed, she intended to lend out her money<br> on mortgages.<br><br> ‘My! My!’ moaned Frank whenever he thought of this. A woman had<br> no business even knowing what a mortgage was.<br><br> Scarlett was full of plans these days and each one of them seemed<br> worse to Frank than the previous one. She even talked of building<br> a saloon on the property where her warehouse had been until Sherman<br> burned it. Frank was no teetotaler but he feverishly protested<br> against the idea. Owning saloon property was a bad business,<br> an unlucky business, almost as bad as renting to a house of<br> prostitution. Just why it was bad, he could not explain to her<br> and to his lame arguments she said ‘Fiddle-dee-dee!’<br><br> ‘Saloons are always good tenants. Uncle Henry said so,’ she told<br> him. ‘They always pay their rent and, look here, Frank, I could<br> put up a cheap salon out of poor-grade lumber I can't sell and get<br> good rent for it, and with the rent money and the money from the<br> mill and what I could get from mortgages, I could buy some more<br> sawmills.’<br><br> ‘Sugar, you don't need any more sawmills!’ cried Frank, appalled.<br> ‘What you ought to do is sell the one you've got. It's wearing you<br> out and you know what trouble you have keeping free darkies at work<br> there--’<br><br> ‘Free darkies are certainly worthless,’ Scarlett agreed, completely<br> ignoring his hint that she should sell. ‘Mr. Johnson says he never<br> knows when he comes to work in the morning whether he'll have a<br> full crew or not. You just can't depend on the darkies any more.<br> They work a day or two and then lay off till they've spent their<br> wages, and the whole crew is like as not to quit overnight. The<br> more I see of emancipation the more criminal I think it is. It's<br> just ruined the darkies. Thousands of them aren't working at all<br> and the ones we can get to work at the mill are so lazy and<br> shiftless they aren't worth having. And if you so much as swear at<br> them, much less hit them a few licks for the good of their souls,<br> the Freedmen's Bureau is down on you like a duck on a June bug.’<br><br> ‘Sugar, you aren't letting Mr. Johnson beat those--’<br><br> ‘Of course not,’ she returned impatiently. ‘Didn't I just say the<br> Yankees would put me in jail if I did?’<br><br> ‘I'll bet your pa never hit a darky a lick in his life,’ said<br> Frank.<br><br> ‘Well, only one. A stable boy who didn't rub down his horse after<br> a day's hunt. But, Frank; it was different then. Free issue<br> niggers are something else, and a good whipping would do some of<br> them a lot of good.’<br><br> Frank was not only amazed at his wife's views and her plans but at<br> the change which had come over her in the few months since their<br> marriage. This wasn't the soft, sweet, feminine person he had<br> taken to wife. In the brief period of the courtship, he thought he<br> had never known a woman more attractively feminine in her reactions<br> to life, ignorant, timid and helpless. Now her reactions were all<br> masculine. Despite her pink cheeks and dimples and pretty smiles,<br> she talked and acted like a man. Her voice was brisk and decisive<br> and she made up her mind instantly and with no girlish shilly-<br> shallying. She knew what she wanted and she went after it by the<br> shortest route, like a man, not by the hidden and circuitous routes<br> peculiar to women.<br><br> It was not that Frank had never seen commanding women before this.<br> Atlanta, like all Southern towns, had its share of dowagers whom no<br> one cared to cross. No one could be more dominating than stout<br> Mrs. Merriwether, more imperious than frail Mrs. Elsing, more<br> artful in securing her own ends than the silver-haired sweet-voiced<br> Mrs. Whiting. But no matter what devices these ladies employed in<br> order to get their own way, they were always feminine devices.<br> They made a point of being deferential to men's opinions, whether<br> they were guided by them or not. They had the politeness to appear<br> to be guided by what men said, and that was what mattered. But<br> Scarlett was guided by no one but herself and was conducting her<br> affairs in a masculine way which had the whole town talking about<br> her.<br><br> ‘And,’ thought Frank miserably, ‘probably talking about me too, for<br> letting her act so unwomanly.’<br><br> Then, there was that Butler man. His frequent calls at Aunt<br> Pitty's house were the greatest humiliation of all. Frank had<br> always disliked him, even when he had done business with him before<br> the war. He often cursed the day he had brought Rhett to Twelve<br> Oaks and introduced him to his friends. He despised him for the<br> cold-blooded way he had acted in his speculations during the war<br> and for the fact that he had not been in the army. Rhett's eight<br> months' service with the Confederacy was known only to Scarlett,<br> for Rhett had begged her, with mock fear, not to reveal his ‘shame’<br> to anyone. Most of all Frank had contempt for him for holding on<br> to the Confederate gold, when honest men like Admiral Bulloch and<br> others confronted with the same situation had turned back thousands<br> to the Federal treasury. But whether Frank liked it or not, Rhett<br> was a frequent caller.<br><br> Ostensibly it was Miss Pitty he came to see and she had no better<br> sense than to believe it and give herself airs over his visits.<br> But Frank had an uncomfortable feeling that Miss Pitty was not the<br> attraction which brought him. Little Wade was very fond of him,<br> though the boy was shy of most people, and even called him ‘Uncle<br> Rhett,’ which annoyed Frank. And Frank could not help remembering<br> that Rhett had squired Scarlett about during the war days and there<br> had been talk about them then. He imagined there might be even<br> worse talk about them now. None of his friends had the courage to<br> mention anything of this sort to Frank, for all their outspoken<br> words on Scarlett's conduct in the matter of the mill. But he<br> could not help noticing that he and Scarlett were less frequently<br> invited to meals and parties and fewer and fewer people came to<br> call on them. Scarlett disliked most of her neighbors and was too<br> busy with her mill to care about seeing the ones she did like, so<br> the lack of calls did not disturb her. But Frank felt it keenly.<br><br> All of his life, Frank had been under the domination of the phrase<br> ‘What will the neighbors say?’ and he was defenseless against the<br> shocks of his wife's repeated disregard of the proprieties. He<br> felt that everyone disapproved of Scarlett and was contemptuous of<br> him for permitting her to ‘unsex herself.’ She did so many things<br> a husband should not permit, according to his views, but if he<br> ordered her to stop them, argued or even criticized, a storm broke<br> on his head.<br><br> ‘My! My!’ he thought helplessly. ‘She can get mad quicker and<br> stay mad longer than any woman I ever saw!’<br><br> Even at the times when things were most pleasant, it was amazing<br> how completely and how quickly the teasing, affectionate wife who<br> hummed to herself as she went about the house could be transformed<br> into an entirely different person. He had only to say: ‘Sugar, if<br> I were you, I wouldn't--’ and the tempest would break.<br><br> Her black brows rushed together to meet in a sharp angle over her<br> nose and Frank cowered, almost visibly. She had the temper of a<br> Tartar and the rages of a wild cat and, at such times, she did not<br> seem to care what she said or how much it hurt. Clouds of gloom<br> hung over the house on such occasions. Frank went early to the<br> store and stayed late. Pitty scrambled into her bedroom like a<br> rabbit panting for its burrow. Wade and Uncle Peter retired to the<br> carriage house and Cookie kept to her kitchen and forebore to raise<br> her voice to praise the Lord in song. Only Mammy endured<br> Scarlett's temper with equanimity and Mammy had had many years of<br> training with Gerald O'Hara and his explosions.<br><br> Scarlett did not mean to be short tempered and she really wanted to<br> make Frank a good wife, for she was fond of him and grateful for<br> his help in saving Tara. But he did try her patience to the<br> breaking point so often and in so many different ways.<br><br> She could never respect a man who let her run over him and the<br> timid, hesitant attitude he displayed in any unpleasant situation,<br> with her or with others, irritated her unbearably. But she could<br> have overlooked these things and even been happy, now that some of<br> her money problems were being solved, except for her constantly<br> renewed exasperation growing out of the many incidents which showed<br> that Frank was neither a good business man nor did he want her to<br> be a good business man.<br><br> As she expected, he had refused to collect the unpaid bills until<br> she prodded him into it, and then he had done it apologetically and<br> half heartedly. That experience was the final evidence she needed<br> to show her that the Kennedy family would never have more than a<br> bare living, unless she personally made the money she was<br> determined to have. She knew now that Frank would be contented to<br> dawdle along with his dirty little store for the rest of his life.<br> He didn't seem to realize what a slender fingerhold they had on<br> security and how important it was to make more money in these<br> troublous times when money was the only protection against fresh<br> calamities.<br><br> Frank might have been a successful business man in the easy days<br> before the war but he was so annoyingly old-fashioned, she thought,<br> and so stubborn about wanting to do things in the old ways, when<br> the old ways and the old days were gone. He was utterly lacking in<br> the aggressiveness needed in these new bitter times. Well, she had<br> the aggressiveness and she intended to use it, whether Frank liked<br> it or not. They needed money and she was making money and it was<br> hard work. The very least Frank could do, in her opinion, was not<br> to interfere with her plans which were getting results.<br><br> With her inexperience, operating the new mill was no easy job and<br> competition was keener now than it had been at first, so she was<br> usually tired and worried and cross when she came home at nights.<br> And when Frank would cough apologetically and say: ‘Sugar, I<br> wouldn't do this,’ or ‘I wouldn't do that, Sugar, if I were you,’<br> it was all she could do to restrain herself from flying into a<br> rage, and frequently she did not restrain herself. If he didn't<br> have the gumption to get out and make some money, why was he always<br> finding fault with her? And the things he nagged her about were so<br> silly! What difference did it make in times like these if she was<br> being unwomanly? Especially when her unwomanly sawmill was<br> bringing in money they needed so badly, she and the family and<br> Tara, and Frank too.<br><br> Frank wanted rest and quiet. The war in which he had served so<br> conscientiously had wrecked his health, cost him his fortune and<br> made him an old man. He regretted none of these things and after<br> four years of war, all he asked of life was peace and kindliness,<br> loving faces about him and the approval of friends. He soon found<br> that domestic peace had its price, and that price was letting<br> Scarlett have her own way, no matter what she might wish to do.<br> So, because he was tired, he bought peace at her own terms.<br> Sometimes, he thought it was worth it to have her smiling when she<br> opened the front door in the cold twilights, kissing him on the ear<br> or the nose or some other inappropriate place, to feel her head<br> snuggling drowsily on his shoulder at night under warm quilts.<br> Home life could be so pleasant when Scarlett was having her own<br> way. But the peace he gained was hollow, only an outward<br> semblance, for he had purchased it at the cost of everything he<br> held to be right in married life.<br><br> ‘A woman ought to pay more attention to her home and her family and<br> not be gadding about like a man,’ he thought. ‘Now, if she just<br> had a baby--’<br><br> He smiled when he thought of a baby and he thought of a baby very<br> often. Scarlett had been most outspoken about not wanting a child,<br> but then babies seldom waited to be invited. Frank knew that many<br> women said they didn't want babies but that was all foolishness and<br> fear. If Scarlett had a baby, she would love it and be content to<br> stay home and tend it like other women. Then she would be forced<br> to sell the mill and his problems would be ended. All women needed<br> babies to make them completely happy and Frank knew that Scarlett<br> was not happy. Ignorant as he was of women, he was not so blind<br> that he could not see she was unhappy at times.<br><br> Sometimes he awoke at night and heard the soft sound of tears<br> muffled in the pillow. The first time he had waked to feel the bed<br> shaking with her sobbing, he had questioned, in alarm: ‘Sugar,<br> what is it?’ and had been rebuked by a passionate cry: ‘Oh, let me<br> alone!’<br><br> Yes, a baby would make her happy and would take her mind off things<br> she had no business fooling with. Sometimes Frank sighed, thinking<br> he had caught a tropic bird, all flame and jewel color, when a wren<br> would have served him just as well. In fact, much better.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXVII<br><br> <br> It was on a wild wet night in April that Tony Fontaine rode in from<br> Jonesboro on a lathered horse that was half dead from exhaustion<br> and came knocking at their door, rousing her and Frank from sleep<br> with their hearts in their throats. Then for the second time in<br> four months, Scarlett was made to feel acutely what Reconstruction<br> in all its implications meant, made to understand more completely<br> what was in Will's mind when he said ‘Our troubles have just<br> begun,’ to know that the bleak words of Ashley, spoken in the wind-<br> swept orchard of Tara, were true: ‘This that's facing all of us is<br> worse than war--worse than prison--worse than death.’<br><br> The first time she had come face to face with Reconstruction was<br> when she learned that Jonas Wilkerson with the aid of the Yankees<br> could evict her from Tara. But Tony's advent brought it all home<br> to her in a far more terrifying manner. Tony came in the dark and<br> the lashing rain and in a few minutes he was gone back into the<br> night forever, but in the brief interval between he raised the<br> curtain on a scene of new horror, a curtain that she felt<br> hopelessly would never be lowered again.<br><br> That stormy night when the knocker hammered on the door with such<br> hurried urgency, she stood on the landing, clutching her wrapper to<br> her and, looking down into the hall below, had one glimpse of<br> Tony's swarthy saturnine face before he leaned forward and blew out<br> the candle in Frank's hand. She hurried down in the darkness to<br> grasp his cold wet hand and hear him whisper: ‘They're after me--<br> going to Texas--my horse is about dead--and I'm about starved.<br> Ashley said you'd-- Don't light the candle! Don't wake the<br> darkies. . . . I don't want to get you folks in trouble if I can<br> help it.’<br><br> With the kitchen blinds drawn and all the shades pulled down to the<br> sills, he permitted a light and he talked to Frank in swift jerky<br> sentences as Scarlett hurried about, trying to scrape together a<br> meal for him.<br><br> He was without a greatcoat and soaked to the skin. He was hatless<br> and his black hair was plastered to his little skull. But the<br> merriment of the Fontaine boys, a chilling merriment that night,<br> was in his little dancing eyes as he gulped down the whisky she<br> brought him. Scarlett thanked God that Aunt Pittypat was snoring<br> undisturbed upstairs. She would certainly swoon if she saw this<br> apparition.<br><br> ‘One damned bast--Scallawag less,’ said Tony, holding out his glass<br> for another drink. ‘I've ridden hard and it'll cost me my skin if<br> I don't get out of here quick, but it was worth it. By God, yes!<br> I'm going to try to get to Texas and lay low there. Ashley was<br> with me in Jonesboro and he told me to come to you all. Got to<br> have another horse, Frank, and some money. My horse is nearly<br> dead--all the way up here at a dead run--and like a fool I went out<br> of the house today like a bat out of hell without a coat or hat or<br> a cent of money. Not that there's much money in our house.’<br><br> He laughed and applied himself hungrily to the cold corn pone and<br> cold turnip greens on which congealed grease was thick in white<br> flakes.<br><br> ‘You can have my horse,’ said Frank calmly. ‘I've only ten dollars<br> with me but if you can wait till morning--’<br><br> ‘Hell's afire, I can't wait!’ said Tony, emphatically but jovially.<br> ‘They're probably right behind me. I didn't get much of a start.<br> If it hadn't been for Ashley dragging me out of there and making me<br> get on my horse, I'd have stayed there like a fool and probably had<br> my neck stretched by now. Good fellow, Ashley.’<br><br> So Ashley was mixed up in this frightening puzzle. Scarlett went<br> cold, her hand at her throat. Did the Yankees have Ashley now?<br> Why, why didn't Frank ask what it was all about? Why did he take<br> it all so coolly, so much as a matter of course? She struggled to<br> get the question to her lips.<br><br> ‘What--’ she began. ‘Who--’<br><br> ‘Your father's old overseer--that damned--Jonas Wilkerson.’<br><br> ‘Did you--is he dead?’<br><br> ‘My God, Scarlett O'Hara!’ said Tony peevishly. ‘When I start out<br> to cut somebody up, you don't think I'd be satisfied with<br> scratching him with the blunt side of my knife, do you? No, by<br> God, I cut him to ribbons.’<br><br> ‘Good,’ said Frank casually. ‘I never liked the fellow.’<br><br> Scarlett looked at him. This was not the meek Frank she knew, the<br> nervous beard clawer who she had learned could be bullied with such<br> ease. There was an air about him that was crisp and cool and he<br> was meeting the emergency with no unnecessary words. He was a man<br> and Tony was a man and this situation of violence was men's<br> business in which a woman had no part.<br><br> ‘But Ashley-- Did he--’<br><br> ‘No. He wanted to kill him but I told him it was my right, because<br> Sally is my sister-in-law, and he saw reason finally. He went into<br> Jonesboro with me, in case Wilkerson got me first. But I don't<br> think old Ash will get in any trouble about it. I hope not. Got<br> any jam for this corn pone? And can you wrap me up something to<br> take with me?’<br><br> ‘I shall scream if you don't tell me everything.’<br><br> ‘Wait till I've gone and then scream if you've got to. I'll tell<br> you about it while Frank saddles the horse. That damned--Wilkerson<br> has caused enough trouble already. I know how he did you about<br> your taxes. That's just one of his meannesses. But the worst<br> thing was the way he kept the darkies stirred up. If anybody had<br> told me I'd ever live to see the day when I'd hate darkies! Damn<br> their black souls, they believe anything those scoundrels tell them<br> and forget every living thing we've done for them. Now the Yankees<br> are talking about letting the darkies vote. And they won't let us<br> vote. Why, there's hardly a handful of Democrats in the whole<br> County who aren't barred from voting, now that they've ruled out<br> every man who fought in the Confederate Army. And if they give the<br> negroes the vote, it's the end of us. Damn it, it's our state! It<br> doesn't belong to the Yankees! By God, Scarlett, it isn't to be<br> borne! And it won't be borne! We'll do something about it if it<br> means another war. Soon we'll be having nigger judges, nigger<br> legislators--black apes out of the jungle--’<br><br> ‘Please--hurry, tell me! What did you do?’<br><br> ‘Give me another mite of that pone before you wrap it up. Well,<br> the word got around that Wilkerson had gone a bit too far with his<br> nigger-equality business. Oh, yes, he talks it to those black<br> fools by the hour. He had the gall--the--’ Tony spluttered<br> helplessly, ‘to say niggers had a right to--to--white women.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Tony, no!’<br><br> ‘By God, yes! I don't wonder you look sick. But hell's afire,<br> Scarlett, it can't be news to you. They've been telling it to them<br> here in Atlanta.’<br><br> ‘I--I didn't know.’<br><br> ‘Well, Frank would have kept it from you. Anyway, after that, we<br> all sort of thought we'd call on Mr. Wilkerson privately by night<br> and tend to him, but before we could-- You remember that black<br> buck, Eustis, who used to be our foreman?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘Came to the kitchen door today while Sally was fixing dinner and--<br> I don't know what he said to her. I guess I'll never know now.<br> But he said something and I heard her scream and I ran into the<br> kitchen and there he was, drunk as a fiddler's bitch--I beg your<br> pardon, Scarlett, it just slipped out.’<br><br> ‘Go on.’<br><br> ‘I shot him and when Mother ran in to take care of Sally, I got my<br> horse and started to Jonesboro for Wilkerson. He was the one to<br> blame. The damned black fool would never have thought of it but<br> for him. And on the way past Tara, I met Ashley and, of course,<br> he went with me. He said to let him do it because of the way<br> Wilkerson acted about Tara and I said No, it was my place because<br> Sally was my own dead brother's wife, and he went with me arguing<br> the whole way. And when we got to town, by God, Scarlett, do you<br> know I hadn't even brought my pistol, I'd left it in the stable.<br> So mad I forgot--’<br><br> He paused and gnawed the tough pone and Scarlett shivered. The<br> murderous rages of the Fontaines had made County history long<br> before this chapter had opened.<br><br> ‘So I had to take my knife to him. I found him in the barroom. I<br> got him in a corner with Ashley holding back the others and I told<br> him why before I lit into him. Why, it was over before I knew it,’<br> said Tony reflecting. ‘First thing I knew, Ashley had me on my<br> horse and told me to come to you folks. Ashley's a good man in a<br> pinch. He keeps his head.’<br><br> Frank came in, his greatcoat over his arm, and handed it to Tony.<br> It was his only heavy coat but Scarlett made no protest. She<br> seemed so much on the outside of this affair, this purely masculine<br> affair.<br><br> ‘But Tony--they need you at home. Surely, if you went back and<br> explained--’<br><br> ‘Frank, you've married a fool,’ said Tony with a grin, struggling<br> into the coat. ‘She thinks the Yankees will reward a man for<br> keeping niggers off his women folks. So they will, with a drumhead<br> court and a rope. Give me a kiss, Scarlett. Frank won't mind and<br> I may never see you again. Texas is a long way off. I won't dare<br> write, so let the home folks know I got this far in safety.’<br><br> She let him kiss her and the two men went out into the driving rain<br> and stood for a moment, talking on the back porch. Then she heard<br> a sudden splashing of hooves and Tony was gone. She opened the<br> door a crack and saw Frank leading a heaving, stumbling horse into<br> the carriage house. She shut the door again and sat down, her<br> knees trembling.<br><br> Now she knew what Reconstruction meant, knew as well as if the<br> house were ringed about by naked savages, squatting in breech<br> clouts. Now there came rushing to her mind many things to which<br> she had given little thought recently, conversations she had heard<br> but to which she had not listened, masculine talk which had been<br> checked half finished when she came into rooms, small incidents in<br> which she had seen no significance at the time, Frank's futile<br> warnings to her against driving out to the mill with only the<br> feeble Uncle Peter to protect her. Now they fitted themselves<br> together into one horrifying picture.<br><br> The negroes were on top and behind them were the Yankee bayonets.<br> She could be killed, she could be raped and, very probably, nothing<br> would ever be done about it. And anyone who avenged her would be<br> hanged by the Yankees, hanged without benefit of trial by judge and<br> jury. Yankee officers who knew nothing of law and cared less for<br> the circumstances of the crime could go through the motions of<br> holding a trial and put a rope around a Southerner's neck.<br><br> ‘What can we do?’ she thought, wringing her hands in an agony of<br> helpless fear. ‘What can we do with devils who'd hang a nice boy<br> like Tony just for killing a drunken buck and a scoundrelly<br> Scallawag to protect his women folks?’<br><br> ‘It isn't to be borne!’ Tony had cried and he was right. It<br> couldn't be borne. But what could they do except bear it, helpless<br> as they were? She fell to trembling and, for the first time in her<br> life, she saw people and events as something apart from herself,<br> saw clearly that Scarlett O'Hara, frightened and helpless, was not<br> all that mattered. There were thousands of women like her, all<br> over the South, who were frightened and helpless. And thousands of<br> men, who had laid down their arms at Appomattox, had taken them up<br> again and stood ready to risk their necks on a minute's notice to<br> protect those women.<br><br> There had been something in Tony's face which had been mirrored in<br> Frank's, an expression she had seen recently on the faces of other<br> men in Atlanta, a look she had noticed but had not troubled to<br> analyze. It was an expression vastly different from the tired<br> helplessness she had seen in the faces of men coming home from the<br> war after the surrender. Those men had not cared about anything<br> except getting home. Now they were caring about something again,<br> numbed nerves were coming back to life and the old spirit was<br> beginning to burn. They were caring again with a cold ruthless<br> bitterness. And, like Tony, they were thinking: ‘It isn't to be<br> borne!’<br><br> She had seen Southern men, soft voiced and dangerous in the days<br> before the war, reckless and hard in the last despairing days of<br> the fighting. But in the faces of the two men who stared at each<br> other across the candle flame so short a while ago there had been<br> something that was different, something that heartened her but<br> frightened her--fury which could find no words, determination which<br> would stop at nothing.<br><br> For the first time, she felt a kinship with the people about her,<br> felt one with them in their fears, their bitterness, their<br> determination. No, it wasn't to be borne! The South was too<br> beautiful a place to be let go without a struggle, too loved to be<br> trampled by Yankees who hated Southerners enough to enjoy grinding<br> them into the dirt, too dear a homeland to be turned over to<br> ignorant negroes drunk with whisky and freedom.<br><br> As she thought of Tony's sudden entrance and swift exit, she felt<br> herself akin to him, for she remembered the old story how her<br> father had left Ireland, left hastily and by night, after a murder<br> which was no murder to him or to his family. Gerald's blood was in<br> her, violent blood. She remembered her hot joy in shooting the<br> marauding Yankee. Violent blood was in them all, perilously close<br> to the surface, lurking just beneath the kindly courteous<br> exteriors. All of them, all the men she knew, even the drowsy-eyed<br> Ashley and fidgety old Frank, were like that underneath--murderous,<br> violent if the need arose. Even Rhett, conscienceless scamp that<br> he was, had killed a negro for being ‘uppity to a lady.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Frank, how long will it be like this?’ she leaped to her feet.<br><br> ‘As long as the Yankees hate us so, Sugar.’<br><br> ‘Is there nothing anybody can do?’<br><br> Frank passed a tired hand over his wet beard. ‘We are doing<br> things.’<br><br> ‘What?’<br><br> ‘Why talk of them till we have accomplished something? It may take<br> years. Perhaps--perhaps the South will always be like this.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no!’<br><br> ‘Sugar, come to bed. You must be chilled. You are shaking.’<br><br> ‘When will it all end?’<br><br> ‘When we can all vote again, Sugar. When every man who fought for<br> the South can put a ballot in the box for a Southerner and a<br> Democrat.’<br><br> ‘A ballot?’ she cried despairingly. ‘What good's a ballot when the<br> darkies have lost their minds--when the Yankees have poisoned them<br> against us?’<br><br> Frank went on to explain in his patient manner, but the idea that<br> ballots could cure the trouble was too complicated for her to<br> follow. She was thinking gratefully that Jonas Wilkerson would<br> never again be a menace of Tara and she was thinking about Tony.<br><br> ‘Oh, the poor Fontaines!’ she exclaimed. ‘Only Alex left and so<br> much to do at Mimosa. Why didn't Tony have sense enough to--to do<br> it at night when no one would know who it was? A sight more good<br> he'd do helping with the spring plowing than in Texas.’<br><br> Frank put an arm about her. Usually he was gingerly when he did<br> this, as if he anticipated being impatiently shaken off, but<br> tonight there was a far-off look in his eyes and his arm was firm<br> about her waist.<br><br> ‘There are things more important now than plowing, Sugar. And<br> scaring the darkies and teaching the Scallawags a lesson is one of<br> them. As long as there are fine boys like Tony left, I guess we<br> won't need to worry about the South too much. Come to bed.’<br><br> ‘But, Frank--’<br><br> ‘If we just stand together and don't give an inch to the Yankees,<br> we'll win, some day. Don't you bother your pretty head about it,<br> Sugar. You let your men folks worry about it. Maybe it won't come<br> in our time, but surely it will come some day. The Yankees will<br> get tired of pestering us when they see they can't even dent us,<br> and then we'll have a decent world to live in and raise our<br> children in.’<br><br> She thought of Wade and the secret she had carried silently for<br> some days. No, she didn't want her children raised in this welter<br> of hate and uncertainty, of bitterness and violence lurking just<br> below the surface, of poverty and grinding hardships and<br> insecurity. She never wanted children of hers to know what all<br> this was like. She wanted a secure and well-ordered world in which<br> she could look forward and know there was a safe future ahead for<br> them, a world where her children would know only softness and<br> warmth and good clothes and fine food.<br><br> Frank thought this could he accomplished by voting. Voting? What<br> did votes matter? Nice people in the South would never have the<br> vote again. There was only one thing in the world that was a<br> certain bulwark against any calamity which fate could bring, and<br> that was money. She thought feverishly that they must have money,<br> lots of it to keep them safe against disaster.<br><br> Abruptly, she told him she was going to have a baby.<br><br> <br><br> For weeks after Tony's escape, Aunt Pitty's house was subjected to<br> repeated searches by parties of Yankee soldiers. They invaded the<br> house at all hours and without warning. They swarmed through the<br> rooms, asking questions, opening closets, prodding clothes hampers,<br> peering under beds. The military authorities had heard that Tony<br> had been advised to go to Miss Pitty's house, and they were certain<br> he was still hiding there or somewhere m the neighborhood.<br><br> As a result, Aunt Pitty was chronically in what Uncle Peter called<br> a ‘state,’ never knowing when her bedroom would be entered by an<br> officer and a squad of men. Neither Frank nor Scarlett had<br> mentioned Tony's brief visit, so the old lady could have revealed<br> nothing, even had she been so inclined. She was entirely honest in<br> her fluttery protestations that she had seen Tony Fontaine only<br> once in her life and that was at Christmas time in 1862.<br><br> ‘And,’ she would add breathlessly to the Yankee soldiers, in an<br> effort to be helpful, ‘he was quite intoxicated at the time.’<br><br> Scarlett, sick and miserable in the early stage of pregnancy,<br> alternated between a passionate hatred of the bluecoats who invaded<br> her privacy, frequently carrying away any little knick-knack that<br> appealed to them, and an equally passionate fear that Tony might<br> prove the undoing of them all. The prisons were full of people who<br> had been arrested for much less reason. She knew that if one iota<br> of the truth were proved against them, not only she and Frank but<br> the innocent Pitty as well would go to jail.<br><br> For some time there had been an agitation in Washington to<br> confiscate all ‘Rebel property’ to pay the United States' war debt<br> and this agitation had kept Scarlett in a state of anguished<br> apprehension. Now, in addition to this, Atlanta was full of wild<br> rumors about the confiscation of property of offenders against<br> military law, and Scarlett quaked lest she and Frank lose not only<br> their freedom but the house, the store and the mill. And even if<br> their property were not appropriated by the military, it would be<br> as good as lost if she and Frank went to jail, for who would look<br> after their business in their absence?<br><br> She hated Tony for bringing such trouble upon them. How could he<br> have done such a thing to friends? And how could Ashley have sent<br> Tony to them? Never again would she give aid to anyone if it meant<br> having the Yankees come down on her like a swarm of hornets. No,<br> she would bar the door against anyone needing help. Except, of<br> course, Ashley. For weeks after Tony's brief visit she woke from<br> uneasy dreams at any sound in the road outside, fearing it might be<br> Ashley trying to make his escape, fleeing to Texas because of the<br> aid he had given Tony. She did not know how matters stood with<br> him, for they did not dare write to Tara about Tony's midnight<br> visit. Their letters might be intercepted by the Yankees and bring<br> trouble upon the plantation as well. But, when weeks went by and<br> they heard no bad news, they knew that Ashley had somehow come<br> clear. And finally, the Yankees ceased annoying them.<br><br> But even this relief did not free Scarlett from the state of dread<br> which began when Tony came knocking at their door, a dread which<br> was worse than the quaking fear of the siege shells, worse even<br> than the terror of Sherman's men during the last days of the war.<br> It was as if Tony's appearance that wild rainy night had stripped<br> merciful blinders from her eyes and forced her to see the true<br> uncertainty of her life.<br><br> Looking about her in that cold spring of 1866, Scarlett realized<br> what was facing her and the whole South. She might plan and<br> scheme, she might work harder than her slaves had ever worked, she<br> might succeed in overcoming all of her hardships, she might through<br> dint of determination solve problems for which her earlier life had<br> provided no training at all. But for all her labor and sacrifice<br> and resourcefulness, her small beginnings purchased at so great a<br> cost might be snatched away from her at any minute. And should<br> this happen, she had no legal rights, no legal redress, except<br> those same drumhead courts of which Tony had spoken so bitterly,<br> those military courts with their arbitrary powers. Only the<br> negroes had rights or redress these days. The Yankees had the<br> South prostrate and they intended to keep it so. The South had<br> been tilted as by a giant malicious hand, and those who had once<br> ruled were now more helpless than their former slaves had ever<br> been.<br><br> Georgia was heavily garrisoned with troops and Atlanta had more<br> than its share. The commandants of the Yankee troops in the<br> various cities had complete power, even the power of life and<br> death, over the civilian population, and they used that power.<br> They could and did imprison citizens for any cause, or no cause,<br> seize their property, hang them. They could and did harass and<br> hamstring them with conflicting regulations about the operation of<br> their business, the wages they must pay their servants, what they<br> should say in public and private utterances and what they should<br> write in newspapers. They regulated how, when and where they must<br> dump their garbage and they decided what songs the daughters and<br> wives of ex-Confederates could sing, so that the singing of ‘Dixie’<br> or ‘Bonnie Blue Flag’ became an offense only a little less serious<br> than treason. They ruled that no one could get a letter our of the<br> post office without taking the Iron Clad oath and, in some<br> instances, they even prohibited the issuance of marriage licenses<br> unless the couples had taken the hated oath.<br><br> The newspapers were so muzzled that no public protest could be<br> raised against the injustices or depredations of the military, and<br> individual protests were silenced with jail sentences. The jails<br> were full of prominent citizens and there they stayed without hope<br> of early trial. Trial by jury and the law of habeas corpus were<br> practically suspended. The civil courts still functioned after a<br> fashion but they functioned at the pleasure of the military, who<br> could and did interfere with their verdicts, so that citizens so<br> unfortunate as to get arrested were virtually at the mercy of the<br> military authorities. And so many did get arrested. The very<br> suspicion of seditious utterances against the government, suspected<br> complicity in the Ku Klux Klan, or complaint by a negro that a<br> white man had been uppity to him were enough to land a citizen in<br> jail. Proof and evidence were not needed. The accusation was<br> sufficient. And thanks to the incitement of the Freedmen's Bureau,<br> negroes could always be found who were willing to bring accusations.<br><br> The negroes had not yet been given the right to vote but the North<br> was determined that they should vote and equally determined that<br> their vote should be friendly to the North. With this in mind,<br> nothing was too good for the negroes. The Yankee soldiers backed<br> them up in anything they chose to do, and the surest way for a<br> white person to get himself into trouble was to bring a complaint<br> of any kind against a negro.<br><br> The former slaves were now the lords of creation and, with the aid<br> of the Yankees, the lowest and most ignorant ones were on top. The<br> better class of them, scorning freedom, were suffering as severely<br> as their white masters. Thousands of house servants, the highest<br> caste in the slave population, remained with their white folks,<br> doing manual labor which had been beneath them in the old days.<br> Many loyal field hands also refused to avail themselves of the new<br> freedom, but the hordes of ‘trashy free issue niggers,’ who were<br> causing most of the trouble, were drawn largely from the field-hand<br> class.<br><br> In slave days, these lowly blacks had been despised by the house<br> negroes and yard negroes as creatures of small worth. Just as<br> Ellen had done, other plantation mistresses throughout the South<br> had put the pickaninnies through courses of training and<br> elimination to select the best of them for the positions of greater<br> responsibility. Those consigned to the fields were the ones least<br> willing or able to learn, the least energetic, the least honest and<br> trustworthy, the most vicious and brutish. And now this class, the<br> lowest in the black social order, was making life a misery for the<br> South.<br><br> Aided by the unscrupulous adventurers who operated the Freedmen's<br> Bureau and urged on by a fervor of Northern hatred almost religious<br> in its fanaticism, the former field hands found themselves suddenly<br> elevated to the seats of the mighty. There they conducted<br> themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be<br> expected to do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among<br> treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension, they<br> ran wild--either from perverse pleasure in destruction or simply<br> because of their ignorance.<br><br> To the credit of the negroes, including the least intelligent of<br> them, few were actuated by malice and those few had usually been<br> ‘mean niggers’ even in slave days. But they were, as a class,<br> childlike in mentality, easily led and from long habit accustomed<br> to taking orders. Formerly their white masters had given the<br> orders. Now they had a new set of masters, the Bureau and the<br> Carpetbaggers, and their orders were: ‘You're just as good as any<br> white man, so act that way. Just as soon as you can vote the<br> Republican ticket, you are going to have the white man's property.<br> It's as good as yours now. Take it, if you can get it!’<br><br> Dazzled by these tales, freedom became a never-ending picnic, a<br> barbecue every day of the week, a carnival of idleness and theft<br> and insolence. Country negroes flocked into the cities, leaving<br> the rural districts without labor to make the crops. Atlanta was<br> crowded with them and still they came by the hundreds, lazy and<br> dangerous as a result of the new doctrines being taught them.<br> Packed into squalid cabins, smallpox, typhoid and tuberculosis<br> broke out among them. Accustomed to the care of their mistresses<br> when they were ill in slave days, they did not know how to nurse<br> themselves or their sick. Relying upon their masters in the old<br> days to care for their aged and their babies, they now had no sense<br> of responsibility for their helpless. And the Bureau was far too<br> interested in political matters to provide the care the plantation<br> owners had once given.<br><br> Abandoned negro children ran like frightened animals about the town<br> until kind-hearted white people took them into their kitchens to<br> raise. Aged country darkies, deserted by their children,<br> bewildered and panic stricken in the bustling town, sat on the<br> curbs and cried to the ladies who passed: ‘Mistis, please Ma'm,<br> write mah old Marster down in Fayette County dat Ah's up hyah.<br> He'll come tek dis ole nigger home agin. 'Fo' Gawd, Ah done got<br> nuff of dis freedom!’<br><br> The Freedmen's Bureau, overwhelmed by the numbers who poured in<br> upon them, realized too late a part of the mistake and tried to<br> send them back to their former owners. They told the negroes that<br> if they would go back, they would go as free workers, protected by<br> written contracts specifying wages by the day. The old darkies<br> went back to the plantations gladly, making a heavier burden than<br> ever on the poverty-stricken planters who had not the heart to turn<br> them out, but the young ones remained in Atlanta. They did not<br> want to be workers of any kind, anywhere. Why work when the belly<br> is full?<br><br> For the first time in their lives the negroes were able to get all<br> the whisky they might want. In slave days, it was something they<br> never tasted except at Christmas, when each one received a ‘drap’<br> along with his gift. Now they had not only the Bureau agitators<br> and the Carpetbaggers urging them on, but the incitement of whisky<br> as well, and outrages were inevitable. Neither life nor property<br> was safe from them and the white people, unprotected by law, were<br> terrorized. Men were insulted on the streets by drunken blacks,<br> houses and barns were burned at night, horses and cattle and<br> chickens stolen in broad daylight, crimes of all varieties were<br> committed and few of the perpetrators were brought to justice.<br><br> But these ignominies and dangers were as nothing compared with the<br> peril of white women, many bereft by the war of male protection,<br> who lived alone in the outlying districts and on lonely roads. It<br> was the large number of outrages on women and the ever-present fear<br> for the safety of their wives and daughters that drove Southern men<br> to cold and trembling fury and caused the Ku Klux Klan to spring up<br> overnight. And it was against this nocturnal organization that the<br> newspapers of the North cried out most loudly, never realizing the<br> tragic necessity that brought it into being. The North wanted<br> every member of the Ku Klux hunted down and hanged, because they<br> had dared take the punishment of crime into their own hands at a<br> time when the ordinary processes of law and order had been<br> overthrown by the invaders.<br><br> Here was the astonishing spectacle of half a nation attempting, at<br> the point of bayonet, to force upon the other half the rule of<br> negroes, many of them scarcely one generation out of the African<br> jungles. The vote must be given to them but it must be denied to<br> most of their former owners. The South must be kept down and<br> disfranchisement of the whites was one way to keep the South down.<br> Most of those who had fought for the Confederacy, held office under<br> it or given aid and comfort to it were not allowed to vote, had no<br> choice in the selection of their public officials and were wholly<br> under the power of an alien rule. Many men, thinking soberly of<br> General Lee's words and example, wished to take the oath, become<br> citizens again and forget the past. But they were not permitted to<br> take it. Others who were permitted to take the oath, hotly refused<br> to do so, scorning to swear allegiance to a government which was<br> deliberately subjecting them to cruelty and humiliation.<br><br> Scarlett heard over and over until she could have screamed at the<br> repetition: ‘I'd have taken their damned oath right after the<br> surrender if they'd acted decent. I can be restored to the Union,<br> but by God, I can't be reconstructed into it!’<br><br> Through these anxious days and nights, Scarlett was torn with fear.<br> The ever-present menace of lawless negroes and Yankee soldiers<br> preyed on her mind, the danger of confiscation was constantly with<br> her, even in her dreams, and she dreaded worse terrors to come.<br> Depressed by the helplessness of herself and her friends, of the<br> whole South, it was not strange that she often remembered during<br> these days the words which Tony Fontaine had spoken so passionately:<br><br> ‘Good God, Scarlett, it isn't to be borne! And it won't be borne!’<br><br> <br><br> In spite of war, fire and Reconstruction, Atlanta had again become<br> a boom town. In many ways, the place resembled the busy young city<br> of the Confederacy's early days. The only trouble was that the<br> soldiers crowding the streets wore the wrong kind of uniforms, the<br> money was in the hands of the wrong people, and the negroes were<br> living in leisure while their former masters struggled and starved.<br><br> Underneath the surface were misery and fear, but all the outward<br> appearances were those of a thriving town that was rapidly<br> rebuilding from its ruins, a bustling, hurrying town. Atlanta, it<br> seemed, must always be hurrying, no matter what its circumstances<br> might be. Savannah, Charleston, Augusta, Richmond, New Orleans<br> would never hurry. It was ill bred and Yankeefied to hurry. But<br> in this period, Atlanta was more ill bred and Yankeefied than it<br> had ever been before or would ever be again. With ‘new people’<br> thronging in from all directions, the streets were choked and noisy<br> from morning till night. The shiny carriages of Yankee officers'<br> wives and newly rich Carpetbaggers splashed mud on the dilapidated<br> buggies of the townspeople, and gaudy new homes of wealthy<br> strangers crowded in among the sedate dwellings of older citizens.<br><br> The war had definitely established the importance of Atlanta in the<br> affairs of the South and the hitherto obscure town was now known<br> far and wide. The railroads for which Sherman had fought an entire<br> summer and killed thousands of men were again stimulating the life<br> of the city they had brought into being. Atlanta was again the<br> center of activities for a wide region, as it had been before its<br> destruction, and the town was receiving a great influx of new<br> citizens, both welcome and unwelcome.<br><br> Invading Carpetbaggers made Atlanta their headquarters and on the<br> streets they jostled against representatives of the oldest families<br> in the South who were likewise newcomers in the town. Families<br> from the country districts who had been burned out during Sherman's<br> march and who could no longer make a living without the slaves to<br> till the cotton had come to Atlanta to live. New settlers were<br> coming in every day from Tennessee and the Carolinas where the hand<br> of Reconstruction lay even heavier than in Georgia. Many Irish and<br> Germans who had been bounty men in the Union Army had settled in<br> Atlanta after their discharge. The wives and families of the<br> Yankee garrison, filled with curiosity about the South after four<br> years of war, came to swell the population. Adventurers of every<br> kind swarmed in, hoping to make their fortunes, and the negroes<br> from the country continued to come by the hundreds.<br><br> The town was roaring--wide open like a frontier village, making no<br> effort to cover its vices and sins. Saloons blossomed overnight,<br> two and sometimes three in a block, and after nightfall the streets<br> were full of drunken men, black and white, reeling from wall to<br> curb and back again. Thugs, pickpockets and prostitutes lurked in<br> the unlit alleys and shadowy streets. Gambling houses ran full<br> blast and hardly a night passed without its shooting or cutting<br> affray. Respectable citizens were scandalized to find that Atlanta<br> had a large and thriving red-light district, larger and more<br> thriving than during the war. All night long pianos jangled from<br> behind drawn shades and rowdy songs and laughter floated out,<br> punctuated by occasional screams and pistol shots. The inmates of<br> these houses were bolder than the prostitutes of the war days and<br> brazenly hung out of their windows and called to passers-by. And<br> on Sunday afternoons, the handsome closed carriages of the madams<br> of the district rolled down the main streets, filled with girls in<br> their best finery, taking the air from behind lowered silk shades.<br><br> Belle Watling was the most notorious of the madams. She had opened<br> a new house of her own, a large two-story building that made<br> neighboring houses in the district look like shabby rabbit warrens.<br> There was a long barroom downstairs, elegantly hung with oil<br> paintings, and a negro orchestra played every night. The upstairs,<br> so rumor said, was fitted out with the finest of plush upholstered<br> furniture, heavy lace curtains and imported mirrors in gilt frames.<br> The dozen young ladies with whom the house was furnished were<br> comely, if brightly painted, and comported themselves more quietly<br> than those of other houses. At least, the police were seldom<br> summoned to Belle's.<br><br> This house was something that the matrons of Atlanta whispered<br> about furtively and ministers preached against in guarded terms as<br> a cesspool of iniquity, a hissing and a reproach. Everyone knew<br> that a woman of Belle's type couldn't have made enough money by<br> herself to set up such a luxurious establishment. She had to have<br> a backer and a rich one at that. And Rhett Butler had never had<br> the decency to conceal his relations with her, so it was obvious<br> that he and no other must be that backer. Belle herself presented<br> a prosperous appearance when glimpsed occasionally in her closed<br> carriage driven by an impudent yellow negro. When she drove by,<br> behind a fine pair of bays, all the little boys along the street<br> who could evade their mothers ran to peer at her and whisper<br> excitedly: ‘That's her! That's ole Belle! I seen her red hair!’<br><br> Shouldering the shell-pitted houses patched with bits of old lumber<br> and smoke-blackened bricks, the fine homes of the Carpetbaggers and<br> war profiteers were rising, with mansard roofs, gables and turrets,<br> stained-glass windows and wide lawns. Night after night, in these<br> newly built homes, the windows were ablaze with gas light and the<br> sound of music and dancing feet drifted out upon the air. Women in<br> stiff bright-colored silks strolled about long verandas, squired by<br> men in evening clothes. Champagne corks popped, and on lace<br> tablecloths seven-course dinners were laid. Hams in wine, pressed<br> duck, pate de foie gras, rare fruits in and out of season, were<br> spread in profusion.<br><br> Behind the shabby doors of the old houses, poverty and hunger<br> lived--all the more bitter for the brave gentility with which they<br> were borne, all the more pinching for the outward show of proud<br> indifference to material wants. Dr. Meade could tell unlovely<br> stories of those families who had been driven from mansions to<br> boarding houses and from boarding houses to dingy rooms on back<br> streets. He had too many lady patients who were suffering from<br> ‘weak hearts’ and ‘declines.’ He knew, and they knew he knew, that<br> slow starvation was the trouble. He could tell of consumption<br> making inroads on entire families and of pellagra, once found only<br> among poor whites, which was now appearing in Atlanta's best<br> families. And there were babies with thin rickety legs and mothers<br> who could not nurse them. Once the old doctor had been wont to<br> thank God reverently for each child he brought into the world. Now<br> he did not think life was such a boon. It was a hard world for<br> little babies and so many died in their first few months of life.<br><br> Bright lights and wine, fiddles and dancing, brocade and broadcloth<br> in the showy big houses and, just around the corners, slow<br> starvation and cold. Arrogance and callousness for the conquerors,<br> bitter endurance and hatred for the conquered.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXVIII<br><br> <br> Scarlett saw it all, lived with it by day, took it to bed with her<br> at night, dreading always what might happen next. She knew that<br> she and Frank were already in the Yankees' black books, because of<br> Tony, and disaster might descend on them at any hour. But, now of<br> all times, she could not afford to be pushed back to her<br> beginnings--not now with a baby coming, the mill just commencing to<br> pay and Tara depending on her for money until the cotton came in in<br> the fall. Oh, suppose she should lose everything! Suppose she<br> should have to start all over again with only her puny weapons<br> against this mad world! To have to pit her red lips and green eyes<br> and her shrewd shallow brain against the Yankees and everything the<br> Yankees stood for. Weary with dread, she felt that she would<br> rather kill herself than try to make a new beginning.<br><br> In the ruin and chaos of that spring of 1866, she single mindedly<br> turned her energies to making the mill pay. There was money in<br> Atlanta. The wave of rebuilding was giving her the opportunity she<br> wanted and she knew she could make money if only she could stay out<br> of jail. But, she told herself time and again, she would have to<br> walk easily, gingerly, be meek under insults, yielding to<br> injustices, never giving offense to anyone, black or white, who<br> might do her harm. She hated the impudent free negroes as much as<br> anyone and her flesh crawled with fury every time she heard their<br> insulting remarks and high-pitched laughter as she went by. But<br> she never even gave them a glance of contempt. She hated the<br> Carpetbaggers and Scallawags who were getting rich with ease while<br> she struggled, but she said nothing in condemnation of them. No<br> one in Atlanta could have loathed the Yankees more than she, for<br> the very sight of a blue uniform made her sick with rage, but even<br> in the privacy of her family she kept silent about them.<br><br> I won't be a big-mouthed fool, she thought grimly. Let others<br> break their hearts over the old days and the men who'll never come<br> back. Let others burn with fury over the Yankee rule and losing<br> the ballot. Let others go to jail for speaking their minds and get<br> themselves hanged for being in the Ku Klux Klan. (Oh, what a<br> dreaded name that was, almost as terrifying to Scarlett as to the<br> negroes.) Let other women be proud that their husbands belonged.<br> Thank God, Frank had never been mixed up in it! Let others stew<br> and fume and plot and plan about things they could not help. What<br> did the past matter compared with the tense present and the dubious<br> future? What did the ballot matter when bread, a roof and staying<br> out of jail were the real problems? And, please God, just let me<br> stay out of trouble until June!<br><br> Only till June! By that month Scarlett knew she would be forced to<br> retire into Aunt Pitty's house and remain secluded there until<br> after her child was born. Already people were criticizing her for<br> appearing in public when she was in such a condition. No lady ever<br> showed herself when she was pregnant. Already Frank and Pitty were<br> begging her not to expose herself--and them--to embarrassment and<br> she had promised them to stop work in June.<br><br> Only till June! By June she must have the mill well enough<br> established for her to leave it. By June she must have money<br> enough to give her at least some little protection against<br> misfortune. So much to do and so little time to do it! She wished<br> for more hours of the day and counted the minutes, as she strained<br> forward feverishly in her pursuit of money and still more money.<br><br> Because she nagged the timid Frank, the store was doing better now<br> and he was even collecting some of the old bills. But it was the<br> sawmill on which her hopes were pinned. Atlanta these days was<br> like a giant plant which had been cut to the ground but now was<br> springing up again with sturdier shoots, thicker foliage, more<br> numerous branches. The demand for building materials was far<br> greater than could be supplied. Prices of lumber, brick and stone<br> soared and Scarlett kept the mill running from dawn until lantern<br> light.<br><br> A part of every day she spent at the mill, prying into everything,<br> doing her best to check the thievery she felt sure was going on.<br> But most of the time she was riding about the town, making the<br> rounds of builders, contractors and carpenters, even calling on<br> strangers she had heard might build at future dates, cajoling them<br> into promises of buying from her and her only.<br><br> Soon she was a familiar sight on Atlanta's streets, sitting in her<br> buggy beside the dignified, disapproving old darky driver, a lap<br> robe pulled high about her, her little mittened hands clasped in<br> her lap. Aunt Pitty had made her a pretty green mantelet which hid<br> her figure and a green pancake hat which matched her eyes, and she<br> always wore these becoming garments on her business calls. A faint<br> dab of rouge on her cheeks and a fainter fragrance of cologne made<br> her a charming picture, as long as she did not alight from the<br> buggy and show her figure. And there was seldom any need for this,<br> for she smiled and beckoned and the men came quickly to the buggy<br> and frequently stood bareheaded in the rain to talk business with<br> her.<br><br> She was not the only one who had seen the opportunities for making<br> money out of lumber, but she did not fear her competitors. She<br> knew with conscious pride in her own smartness that she was the<br> equal of any of them. She was Gerald's own daughter and the shrewd<br> trading instinct she had inherited was now sharpened by her needs.<br><br> At first the other dealers had laughed at her, laughed with good-<br> natured contempt at the very idea of a woman in business. But now<br> they did not laugh. They swore silently as they saw her ride by.<br> The fact that she was a woman frequently worked in her favor, for<br> she could upon occasion look so helpless and appealing that she<br> melted hearts. With no difficulty whatever she could mutely convey<br> the impression of a brave but timid lady, forced by brutal<br> circumstance into a distasteful position, a helpless little lady<br> who would probably starve if customers didn't buy her lumber. But<br> when ladylike airs failed to get results she was coldly businesslike<br> and willingly undersold her competitors at a loss to herself if it<br> would bring her a new customer. She was not above selling a poor<br> grade of lumber for the price of good lumber if she thought she<br> would not be detected, and she had no scruples about black-guarding<br> the other lumber dealers. With every appearance of reluctance at<br> disclosing the unpleasant truth, she would sigh and tell prospective<br> customers that her competitors' lumber was far too high in price,<br> rotten, full of knot holes and in general of deplorably poor<br> quality.<br><br> The first time Scarlett lied in this fashion she felt disconcerted<br> and guilty--disconcerted because the lie sprang so easily and<br> naturally to her lips, guilty because the thought flashed into her<br> mind: What would Mother say?<br><br> There was no doubt what Ellen would say to a daughter who told lies<br> and engaged in sharp practices. She would be stunned and<br> incredulous and would speak gentle words that stung despite their<br> gentleness, would talk of honor and honesty and truth and duty to<br> one's neighbor. Momentarily, Scarlett cringed as she pictured the<br> look on her mother's face. And then the picture faded, blotted out<br> by an impulse, hard, unscrupulous and greedy, which had been born<br> in the lean days at Tara and was now strengthened by the present<br> uncertainty of life. So she passed this milestone as she had<br> passed others before it--with a sigh that she was not as Ellen<br> would like her to be, a shrug and the repetition of her unfailing<br> charm: ‘I'll think of all this later.’<br><br> But she never again thought of Ellen in connection with her<br> business practices, never again regretted any means she used to<br> take trade away from other lumber dealers. She knew she was<br> perfectly safe in lying about them. Southern chivalry protected<br> her. A Southern lady could lie about a gentleman but a Southern<br> gentleman could not lie about a lady or, worse still, call the lady<br> a liar. Other lumbermen could only fume inwardly and state<br> heatedly, in the bosoms of their families, that they wished to God<br> Mrs. Kennedy was a man for just about five minutes.<br><br> One poor white who operated a mill on the Decatur road did try to<br> fight Scarlett with her own weapons, saying openly that she was a<br> liar and a swindler. But it hurt him rather than helped, for<br> everyone was appalled that even a poor white should say such<br> shocking things about a lady of good family, even when the lady was<br> conducting herself in such an unwomanly way. Scarlett bore his<br> remarks with silent dignity and, as time went by, she turned all<br> her attention to him and his customers. She undersold him so<br> relentlessly and delivered, with secret groans, such an excellent<br> quality of lumber to prove her probity that he was soon bankrupt.<br> Then, to Frank's horror, she triumphantly bought his mill at her<br> own price.<br><br> Once in her possession there arose the perplexing problem of<br> finding a trustworthy man to put in charge of it. She did not want<br> another man like Mr. Johnson. She knew that despite all her<br> watchfulness he was still selling her lumber behind her back, but<br> she thought it would be easy to find the right sort of man. Wasn't<br> everybody as poor as Job's turkey, and weren't the streets full of<br> men, some of them formerly rich, who were without work? The day<br> never went by that Frank did not give money to some hungry ex-<br> soldier or that Pitty and Cookie did not wrap up food for gaunt<br> beggars.<br><br> But Scarlett, for some reason she could not understand, did not<br> want any of these. ‘I don't want men who haven't found something<br> to do after a year,’ she thought. ‘If they haven't adjusted to<br> peace yet, they couldn't adjust to me. And they all look so<br> hangdog and licked. I don't want a man who's licked. I want<br> somebody who's smart and energetic like Renny or Tommy Wellburn or<br> Kells Whiting or one of the Simmons boys or--or any of that tribe.<br> They haven't got that I-don't-care-about-anything look the soldiers<br> had right after the surrender. They look like they cared a heap<br> about a heap of things.’<br><br> But to her surprise the Simmons boys, who had started a brick kiln,<br> and Kells Whiting, who was selling a preparation made up in his<br> mother's kitchen, that was guaranteed to straighten the kinkiest<br> negro hair in six applications, smiled politely, thanked her and<br> refused. It was the same with the dozen others she approached. In<br> desperation she raised the wage she was offering but she was still<br> refused. One of Mrs. Merriwether's nephews observed impertinently<br> that while he didn't especially enjoy driving a dray, it was his<br> own dray and he would rather get somewhere under his own steam than<br> Scarlett's.<br><br> One afternoon, Scarlett pulled up her buggy beside Rene Picard's<br> pie wagon and hailed Rene and the crippled Tommy Wellburn, who was<br> catching a ride home with his friend.<br><br> ‘Look here, Renny, why don't you come and work for me? Managing a<br> mill is a sight more respectable than driving a pie wagon. I'd<br> think you'd be ashamed.’<br><br> ‘Me, I am dead to shame,’ grinned Rene. ‘Who would be respectable?<br> All of my days I was respectable until ze war set me free lak ze<br> darkies. Nevaire again must I be deegneefied and full of ennui.<br> Free lak ze bird! I lak my pie wagon. I lak my mule. I lak ze<br> dear Yankees who so kindly buy ze pie of Madame Belle Mere. No, my<br> Scarlett, I must be ze King of ze Pies. Eet ees my destiny! Lak<br> Napoleon, I follow my star.’ He flourished his whip dramatically.<br><br> ‘But you weren't raised to sell pies any more than Tommy was raised<br> to wrastle with a bunch of wild Irish masons. My kind of work is<br> more--’<br><br> ‘And I suppose you were raised to run a lumber mill,’ said Tommy,<br> the corners of his mouth twitching. ‘Yes, I can just see little<br> Scarlett at her mother's knee, lisping her lesson, 'Never sell good<br> lumber if you can get a better price for bad.'‘<br><br> Rene roared at this, his small monkey eyes dancing with glee as he<br> whacked Tommy on his twisted back.<br><br> ‘Don't be impudent,’ said Scarlett coldly, for she saw little humor<br> in Tommy's remark. ‘Of course, I wasn't raised to run a sawmill.’<br><br> ‘I didn't mean to be impudent. But you are running a sawmill,<br> whether you were raised to it or not. And running it very well,<br> too. Well, none of us, as far as I can see, are doing what we<br> intended to do right now, but I think we'll make out just the same.<br> It's a poor person and a poor nation that sits down and cries<br> because life isn't precisely what they expected it to be. Why<br> don't you pick up some enterprising Carpetbagger to work for you,<br> Scarlett? The woods are full of them, God knows.’<br><br> ‘I don't want a Carpetbagger. Carpetbaggers will steal anything<br> that isn't red hot or nailed down. If they amounted to anything<br> they'd have stayed where they were, instead of coming down here to<br> pick our bones. I want a nice man, from nice folks, who is smart<br> and honest and energetic and--’<br><br> ‘You don't want much. And you won't get it for the wage you're<br> offering. All the men of that description, barring the badly<br> maimed ones, have already got something to do. They may be round<br> pegs in square holes but they've all got something to do.<br> Something of their own that they'd rather do than work for a<br> woman.’<br><br> ‘Men haven't got much sense, have they, when you get down to rock<br> bottom?’<br><br> ‘Maybe not but they've got a heap of pride,’ said Tommy soberly.<br><br> ‘Pride! Pride tastes awfully good, especially when the crust is<br> flaky and you put meringue on it,’ said Scarlett tartly.<br><br> The two men laughed, a bit unwillingly, and it seemed to Scarlett<br> that they drew together in united masculine disapproval of her.<br> What Tommy said was true, she thought, running over in her mind the<br> men she had approached and the ones she intended to approach. They<br> were all busy, busy at something, working hard, working harder than<br> they would have dreamed possible in the days before the war. They<br> weren't doing what they wanted to do perhaps, or what was easiest<br> to do, or what they had been reared to do, but they were doing<br> something. Times were too hard for men to be choosy. And if they<br> were sorrowing for lost hopes, longing for lost ways of living, no<br> one knew it but they. They were fighting a new war, a harder war<br> than the one before. And they were caring about life again, caring<br> with the same urgency and the same violence that animated them<br> before the war had cut their lives in two.<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ said Tommy awkwardly, ‘I do hate to ask a favor of you,<br> after being impudent to you, but I'm going to ask it just the same.<br> Maybe it would help you anyway. My brother-in-law, Hugh Elsing,<br> isn't doing any too well peddling kindling wood. Everybody except<br> the Yankees goes out and collects his own kindling wood. And I<br> know things are mighty hard with the whole Elsing family. I--I do<br> what I can, but you see I've got Fanny to support, and then, too,<br> I've got my mother and two widowed sisters down in Sparta to look<br> after. Hugh is nice, and you wanted a nice man, and he's from nice<br> folks, as you know, and he's honest.’<br><br> ‘But--well, Hugh hasn't got much gumption or else he'd make a<br> success of his kindling.’<br><br> Tommy shrugged.<br><br> ‘You've got a hard way of looking at things, Scarlett,’ he said.<br> ‘But you think Hugh over. You could go far and do worse. I think<br> his honesty and his willingness will outweigh his lack of<br> gumption.’<br><br> Scarlett did not answer, for she did not want to be too rude. But<br> to her mind there were few, if any, qualities that out-weighed<br> gumption.<br><br> After she had unsuccessfully canvassed the town and refused the<br> importuning of many eager Carpetbaggers, she finally decided to<br> take Tommy's suggestion and ask Hugh Elsing. He had been a dashing<br> and resourceful officer during the war, but two severe wounds and<br> four years of fighting seemed to have drained him of all his<br> resourcefulness, leaving him to face the rigors of peace as<br> bewildered as a child. There was a lost-dog look in his eyes these<br> days as he went about peddling his firewood, and he was not at all<br> the kind of man she had hoped to get.<br><br> ‘He's stupid,’ she thought. ‘He doesn't know a thing about<br> business and I'll bet he can't add two and two. And I doubt if<br> he'll ever learn. But, at least, he's honest and won't swindle<br> me.’<br><br> Scarlett had little use these days for honesty in herself, but the<br> less she valued it in herself the more she was beginning to value<br> it in others.<br><br> ‘It's a pity Johnnie Gallegher is tied up with Tommy Wellburn on<br> that construction work,’ she thought. ‘He's just the kind of man I<br> want. He's hard as nails and slick as a snake, but he'd be honest<br> if it paid him to be honest. I understand him and he understands<br> me and we could do business together very well. Maybe I can get<br> him when the hotel is finished and till then I'll have to make out<br> on Hugh and Mr. Johnson. If I put Hugh in charge of the new mill<br> and leave Mr. Johnson at the old one, I can stay in town and see to<br> the selling while they handle the milling and hauling. Until I can<br> get Johnnie I'll have to risk Mr. Johnson robbing me if I stay in<br> town all the time. If only he wasn't a thief! I believe I'll<br> build a lumber yard on half that lot Charles left me. If only<br> Frank didn't holler so loud about me building a saloon on the other<br> half! Well, I shall build the saloon just as soon as I get enough<br> money ahead, no matter how he takes on. If only Frank wasn't so<br> thin skinned. Oh, God, if only I wasn't going to have a baby at<br> this of all times! In a little while I'll be so big I can't go<br> out. Oh, God, if only I wasn't going to have a baby! And oh, God,<br> if the damned Yankees will only let me alone! If--’<br><br> If! If! If! There were so many ifs in life, never any certainty<br> of anything, never any sense of security, always the dread of<br> losing everything and being cold and hungry again. Of course,<br> Frank was making a little more money now, but Frank was always<br> ailing with colds and frequently forced to stay in bed for days.<br> Suppose he should become an invalid. No, she could not afford to<br> count on Frank for much. She must not count on anything or anybody<br> but herself. And what she could earn seemed so pitiably small.<br> Oh, what would she do if the Yankees came and took it all away from<br> her? If! If! If!<br><br> Half of what she made every month went to Will at Tara, part to<br> Rhett to repay his loan and the rest she hoarded. No miser ever<br> counted his gold oftener than she and no miser ever had greater<br> fear of losing it. She would not put the money in the bank, for it<br> might fail or the Yankees might confiscate it. So she carried what<br> she could with her, tucked into her corset, and hid small wads of<br> bills about the house, under loose bricks on the hearth, in her<br> scrap bag, between the pages of the Bible. And her temper grew<br> shorter and shorter as the weeks went by, for every dollar she<br> saved would be just one more dollar to lose if disaster descended.<br><br> Frank, Pitty and the servants bore her outbursts with maddening<br> kindness, attributing her bad disposition to her pregnancy, never<br> realizing the true cause. Frank knew that pregnant women must be<br> humored, so he put his pride in his pocket and said nothing more<br> about her running the mills and her going about town at such a<br> time, as no lady should do. Her conduct was a constant<br> embarrassment to him but he reckoned he could endure it for a while<br> longer. After the baby came, he knew she would be the same sweet,<br> feminine girl he had courted. But in spite of everything he did to<br> appease her, she continued to have her tantrums and often he<br> thought she acted like one possessed.<br><br> No one seemed to realize what really possessed her, what drove her<br> like a mad woman. It was a passion to get her affairs in order<br> before she had to retire behind doors, to have as much money as<br> possible in case the deluge broke upon her again, to have a stout<br> levee of cash against the rising tide of Yankee hate. Money was<br> the obsession dominating her mind these days. When she thought of<br> the baby at all, it was with baffled rage at the untimeliness of it.<br><br> ‘Death and taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time<br> for any of them!’<br><br> <br><br> Atlanta had been scandalized enough when Scarlett, a woman, began<br> operating the sawmill but, as time went by, the town decided there<br> was no limit to what she would do. Her sharp trading was shocking,<br> especially when her poor mother had been a Robillard, and it was<br> positively indecent the way she kept on going about the streets<br> when everyone knew she was pregnant. No respectable white woman<br> and few negroes ever went outside their homes from the moment they<br> first suspected they were with child, and Mrs. Merriwether declared<br> indignantly that from the way Scarlett was acting she was likely to<br> have the baby on the public streets.<br><br> But all the previous criticism of her conduct was as nothing<br> compared with the buzz of gossip that now went through the town.<br> Scarlett was not only trafficking with the Yankees but was giving<br> every appearance of really liking it!<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether and many other Southerners were also doing<br> business with the newcomers from the North, but the difference was<br> that they did not like it and plainly showed they did not like it.<br> And Scarlett did, or seemed to, which was just as bad. She had<br> actually taken tea with the Yankee officers' wives in their homes!<br> In fact, she had done practically everything short of inviting them<br> into her own home, and the town guessed she would do even that,<br> except for Aunt Pitty and Frank.<br><br> Scarlett knew the town was talking but she did not care, could not<br> afford to care. She still hated the Yankees with as fierce a hate<br> as on the day when they tried to burn Tara, but she could dissemble<br> that hate. She knew that if she was going to make money, she would<br> have to make it out of the Yankees, and she had learned that<br> buttering them up with smiles and kind words was the surest way to<br> get their business for her mill.<br><br> Some day when she was very rich and her money was hidden away where<br> the Yankees could not find it, then, then she would tell them<br> exactly what she thought of them, tell them how she hated and<br> loathed and despised them. And what a joy that would be! But<br> until that time came, it was just plain common sense to get along<br> with them. And if that was hypocrisy, let Atlanta make the most of<br> it.<br><br> She discovered that making friends with the Yankee officers was as<br> easy as shooting birds on the ground. They were lonely exiles in a<br> hostile land and many of them were starved for polite feminine<br> associations in a town where respectable women drew their skirts<br> aside in passing and looked as if they would like to spit on them.<br> Only the prostitutes and the negro women had kind words for them.<br> But Scarlett was obviously a lady and a lady of family, for all<br> that she worked, and they thrilled to her flashing smile and the<br> pleasant light in her green eyes.<br><br> Frequently when Scarlett sat in her buggy talking to them and<br> making her dimples play, her dislike for them rose so strong that<br> it was hard not to curse them to their faces. But she restrained<br> herself and she found that twisting Yankee men around her finger<br> was no more difficult than that same diversion had been with<br> Southern men. Only this was no diversion but a grim business. The<br> role she enacted was that of a refined sweet Southern lady in<br> distress. With an air of dignified reserve she was able to keep<br> her victims at their proper distance, but there was nevertheless a<br> graciousness in her manner which left a certain warmth in the<br> Yankee officers' memories of Mrs. Kennedy.<br><br> This warmth was very profitable--as Scarlett had intended it to be.<br> Many of the officers of the garrison, not knowing how long they<br> would be stationed in Atlanta, had sent for their wives and<br> families. As the hotels and boarding houses were overflowing, they<br> were building small houses; and they were glad to buy their lumber<br> from the gracious Mrs. Kennedy, who treated them more politely than<br> anyone else in town. The Carpetbaggers and Scallawags also, who<br> were building fine homes and stores and hotels with their new<br> wealth, found it more pleasant to do business with her than with<br> the former Confederate soldiers who were courteous but with a<br> courtesy more formal and cold than outspoken hate.<br><br> So, because she was pretty and charming and could appear quite<br> helpless and forlorn at times, they gladly patronized her lumber<br> yard and also Frank's store, feeling that they should help a plucky<br> little woman who apparently had only a shiftless husband to support<br> her. And Scarlett, watching the business grow, felt that she was<br> safeguarding not only the present with Yankee money but the future<br> with Yankee friends.<br><br> Keeping her relations with the Yankee officers on the plane she<br> desired was easier than she expected, for they all seemed to be in<br> awe of Southern ladies, but Scarlett soon found that their wives<br> presented a problem she had not anticipated. Contacts with the<br> Yankee women were not of her seeking. She would have been glad to<br> avoid them but she could not, for the officers' wives were<br> determined to meet her. They had an avid curiosity about the South<br> and Southern women, and Scarlett gave them their first opportunity<br> to satisfy it. Other Atlanta women would have nothing to do with<br> them and even refused to bow to them in church, so when business<br> brought Scarlett to their homes, she was like an answer to prayer.<br> Often when Scarlett sat in her buggy in front of a Yankee home<br> talking of uprights and shingles with the man of the house, the<br> wife came out to join in the conversation or insist that she come<br> inside for a cup of tea. Scarlett seldom refused, no matter how<br> distasteful the idea might be, for she always hoped to have an<br> opportunity to suggest tactfully that they do their trading at<br> Frank's store. But her self-control was severely tested many<br> times, because of the personal questions they asked and because of<br> the smug and condescending attitude they displayed toward all<br> things Southern.<br><br> Accepting Uncle Tom's Cabin as revelation second only to the Bible,<br> the Yankee women all wanted to know about the bloodhounds which<br> every Southerner kept to track down runaway slaves. And they never<br> believed her when she told them she had only seen one bloodhound in<br> all her life and it was a small mild dog and not a huge ferocious<br> mastiff. They wanted to know about the dreadful branding irons<br> which planters used to mark the faces of their slaves and the cat-<br> o'-nine-tails with which they beat them to death, and they<br> evidenced what Scarlett felt was a very nasty and ill-bred interest<br> in slave concubinage. Especially did she resent this in view of<br> the enormous increase in mulatto babies in Atlanta since the Yankee<br> soldiers had settled in the town.<br><br> Any other Atlanta woman would have expired in rage at having to<br> listen to such bigoted ignorance but Scarlett managed to control<br> herself. Assisting her in this was the fact that they aroused her<br> contempt more than her anger. After all, they were Yankees and no<br> one expected anything better from Yankees. So their unthinking<br> insults to her state, her people and their morals, glanced off and<br> never struck deep enough to cause her more than a well-concealed<br> sneer until an incident occurred which made her sick with rage and<br> showed her, if she needed any showing, how wide was the gap between<br> North and South and how utterly impossible it was to bridge it.<br><br> While driving home with Uncle Peter one afternoon, she passed the<br> house into which were crowded the families of three officers who<br> were building their own homes with Scarlett's lumber. The three<br> wives were standing in the walk as she drove by and they waved to<br> her to stop. Coming out to the carriage block they greeted her in<br> accents that always made her feel that one could forgive Yankees<br> almost anything except their voices.<br><br> ‘You are just the person I want to see, Mrs. Kennedy,’ said a tall<br> thin woman from Maine. ‘I want to get some information about this<br> benighted town.’<br><br> Scarlett swallowed the insult to Atlanta with the contempt it<br> deserved and smiled her best.<br><br> ‘And what can I tell you?’<br><br> ‘My nurse, my Bridget, has gone back North. She said she wouldn't<br> stay another day down here among the 'naygurs' as she calls them.<br> And the children are just driving me distracted! Do tell me how to<br> go about getting another nurse. I do not know where to apply.’<br><br> ‘That shouldn't be difficult,’ said Scarlett and laughed. ‘If you<br> can find a darky just in from the country who hasn't been spoiled<br> by the Freedmen's Bureau, you'll have the best kind of servant<br> possible. Just stand at your gate here and ask every darky woman<br> who passes and I'm sure--’<br><br> The three women broke into indignant outcries.<br><br> ‘Do you think I'd trust my babies to a black nigger?’ cried the<br> Maine woman. ‘I want a good Irish girl.’<br><br> ‘I'm afraid you'll find no Irish servants in Atlanta,’ answered<br> Scarlett, coolness in her voice. ‘Personally, I've never seen a<br> white servant and I shouldn't care to have one in my house. And,’<br> she could not keep a slight note of sarcasm from her words, ‘I<br> assure you that darkies aren't cannibals and are quite trustworthy.’<br><br> ‘Goodness, no! I wouldn't have one in my house. The idea!’<br><br> ‘I wouldn't trust them any farther than I could see them and as for<br> letting them handle my babies . . .’<br><br> Scarlett thought of the kind, gnarled hands of Mammy worn rough in<br> Ellen's service and hers and Wade's. What did these strangers know<br> of black hands, how dear and comforting they could be, how<br> unerringly they knew how to soothe, to pat, to fondle? She laughed<br> shortly.<br><br> ‘It's strange you should feel that way when it was you all who<br> freed them.’<br><br> ‘Lor'! Not I, dearie,’ laughed the Maine woman. ‘I never saw a<br> nigger till I came South last month and I don't care if I never<br> see another. They give me the creeps. I wouldn't trust one of<br> them. . . .’<br><br> For some moments Scarlett had been conscious that Uncle Peter was<br> breathing hard and sitting up very straight as he stared steadily<br> at the horse's ears. Her attention was called to him more forcibly<br> when the Maine woman broke off suddenly with a laugh and pointed<br> him out to her companions.<br><br> ‘Look at that old nigger swell up like a toad,’ she giggled. ‘I'll<br> bet he's an old pet of yours, isn't he? You Southerners don't know<br> how to treat niggers. You spoil them to death.’<br><br> Peter sucked in his breath and his wrinkled brow showed deep<br> furrows but he kept his eyes straight ahead. He had never had the<br> term ‘nigger’ applied to him by a white person in all his life. By<br> other negroes, yes. But never by a white person. And to be called<br> untrustworthy and an ‘old pet,’ he, Peter, who had been the<br> dignified mainstay of the Hamilton family for years!<br><br> Scarlett felt, rather than saw, the black chin begin to shake with<br> hurt pride, and a killing rage swept over her. She had listened<br> with calm contempt while these women had underrated the Confederate<br> Army, blackguarded Jeff Davis and accused Southerners of murder and<br> torture of their slaves. If it were to her advantage she would<br> have endured insults about her own virtue and honesty. But the<br> knowledge that they had hurt the faithful old darky with their<br> stupid remarks fired her like a match in gunpowder. For a moment<br> she looked at the big horse pistol in Peter's belt and her hands<br> itched for the feel of it. They deserved killing, these insolent,<br> ignorant, arrogant conquerors. But she bit down on her teeth until<br> her jaw muscles stood out, reminding herself that the time had not<br> yet come when she could tell the Yankees just what she thought of<br> them. Some day, yes. My God, yes! But not yet.<br><br> ‘Uncle Peter is one of our family,’ she said, her voice shaking.<br> ‘Good afternoon. Drive on, Peter.’<br><br> Peter laid the whip on the horse so suddenly that the startled<br> animal jumped forward and as the buggy jounced off, Scarlett heard<br> the Maine woman say with puzzled accents: ‘Her family? You don't<br> suppose she meant a relative? He's exceedingly black.’<br><br> God damn them! They ought to be wiped off the face of the earth.<br> If ever I get money enough, I'll spit in all their faces! I'll--<br><br> She glanced at Peter and saw that a tear was trickling down his<br> nose. Instantly a passion of tenderness, of grief for his<br> humiliation swamped her, made her eyes sting. It was as though<br> someone had been senselessly brutal to a child. Those women had<br> hurt Uncle Peter--Peter who had been through the Mexican War with<br> old Colonel Hamilton, Peter who had held his master in his arms<br> when he died, who had raised Melly and Charles and looked after the<br> feckless, foolish Pittypat, ‘pertecked’ her when she refugeed, and<br> ‘'quired’ a horse to bring her back from Macon through a war-torn<br> country after the surrender. And they said they wouldn't trust<br> niggers!<br><br> ‘Peter,’ she said, her voice breaking as she put her hand on his<br> thin arm. ‘I'm ashamed of you for crying. What do you care? They<br> aren't anything but damned Yankees!’<br><br> ‘Dey talked in front of me lak Ah wuz a mule an' couldn' unnerstan'<br> dem--lak Ah wuz a Affikun an' din' know whut dey wuz talkin'<br> 'bout,’ said Peter, giving a tremendous sniff. ‘An' dey call me a<br> nigger an' Ah' ain' never been call a nigger by no w'ite folks, an'<br> dey call me a ole pet an' say dat niggers ain' ter be trus'ed! Me<br> not ter be trus'ed! Why, w'en de ole Cunnel wuz dyin' he say ter<br> me, 'You, Peter! You look affer mah chillun. Tek keer of yo'<br> young Miss Pittypat,' he say, ''cause she ain' got no mo' sense dan<br> a hoppergrass.' An' Ah done tek keer of her good all dese y'ars--’<br><br> ‘Nobody but the Angel Gabriel could have done better,’ said<br> Scarlett soothingly. ‘We just couldn't have lived without you.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, thankee kinely, Ma'm. Ah knows it an' you knows it, but<br> dem Yankee folks doan know it an' dey doan want ter know it.<br> Huccome dey come mixin' in our bizness, Miss Scarlett? Dey doan<br> unnerstan' us Confedruts.’<br><br> Scarlett said nothing for she was still burning with the wrath she<br> had not exploded in the Yankee women's faces. The two drove home<br> in silence. Peter's sniffles stopped and his underlip began to<br> protrude gradually until it stuck out alarmingly. His indignation<br> was mounting, now that the initial hurt was subsiding.<br><br> Scarlett thought: What damnably queer people Yankees are! Those<br> women seemed to think that because Uncle Peter was black, he had no<br> ears to hear with and no feelings, as tender as their own, to be<br> hurt. They did not know that negroes had to be handled gently, as<br> though they were children, directed, praised, petted, scolded.<br> They didn't understand negroes or the relations between the negroes<br> and their former masters. Yet they had fought a war to free them.<br> And having freed them, they didn't want to have anything to do with<br> them, except to use them to terrorize Southerners. They didn't<br> like them, didn't trust them, didn't understand them, and yet their<br> constant cry was that Southerners didn't know how to get along with<br> them.<br><br> Not trust a darky! Scarlett trusted them far more than most white<br> people, certainly more than she trusted any Yankee. There were<br> qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no<br> strain could break, no money could buy. She thought of the<br> faithful few who remained at Tara in the face of the Yankee<br> invasion when they could have fled or joined the troops for lives<br> of leisure. But they had stayed. She thought of Dilcey toiling in<br> the cotton fields beside her, of Pork risking his life in<br> neighboring hen houses that the family might eat, of Mammy coming<br> to Atlanta with her to keep her from doing wrong. She thought of<br> the servants of her neighbors who had stood loyally beside their<br> white owners, protecting their mistresses while the men were at the<br> front, refugeeing with them through the terrors of the war, nursing<br> the wounded, burying the dead, comforting the bereaved, working,<br> begging, stealing to keep food on the tables. And even now, with<br> the Freedmen's Bureau promising all manner of wonders, they still<br> stuck with their white folks and worked much harder than they ever<br> worked in slave times. But the Yankees didn't understand these<br> things and would never understand them.<br><br> ‘Yet they set you free,’ she said aloud.<br><br> ‘No, Ma'm! Dey din' sot me free. Ah wouldn' let no sech trash sot<br> me free,’ said Peter indignantly. ‘Ah still b'longs ter Miss Pitty<br> an' w'en Ah dies she gwine lay me in de Hamilton buhyin' groun'<br> whar Ah b'longs. . . . Mah Miss gwine ter be in a state w'en Ah<br> tells her 'bout how you let dem Yankee women 'sult me.’<br><br> ‘I did no such thing!’ cried Scarlett, startled.<br><br> ‘You did so, Miss Scarlett,’ said Peter, pushing out his lip even<br> farther. ‘De pint is, needer you nor me had no bizness bein' wid<br> Yankees, so dey could 'sult me. Ef you hadn't talked wid dem, dey<br> wouldn' had no chance ter treat me lak a mule or a Affikun. An'<br> you din' tek up fer me, needer.’<br><br> ‘I did, too!’ said Scarlett, stung by the criticism. ‘Didn't I<br> tell them you were one of the family?’<br><br> ‘Dat ain' tekkin' up. Dat's jes' a fac',’ said Peter. ‘Miss<br> Scarlett, you ain' got no bizness havin' no truck wid Yankees.<br> Ain' no other ladies doin' it. You wouldn' ketch Miss Pitty wipin'<br> her lil shoes on sech trash. An' she ain' gwine lake it w'en she<br> hear 'bout whut dey said 'bout me.’<br><br> Peter's criticism hurt worse than anything Frank or Aunt Pitty or<br> the neighbors had said and it so annoyed her she longed to shake<br> the old darky until his toothless gums clapped together. What<br> Peter said was true but she hated to hear it from a negro and a<br> family negro, too. Not to stand high in the opinion of one's<br> servants was as humiliating a thing as could happen to a<br> Southerner.<br><br> ‘A ole pet!’ Peter grumbled. ‘Ah specs Miss Pitty ain't gwine want<br> me ter drive you roun' no mo' after dat. No, Ma'm!’<br><br> ‘Aunt Pitty will want you to drive me as usual,’ she said sternly,<br> ‘so let's hear no more about it.’<br><br> ‘Ah'll git a mizry in mak back,’ warned Peter darkly. ‘Mah back<br> huttin' me so bad dis minute Ah kain sceercely set up. Mah Miss<br> ain' gwine want me ter do no drivin' w'en Ah got a mizry. . . .<br> Miss Scarlett, it ain' gwine do you no good ter stan' high wid de<br> Yankees an' de w'ite trash, ef yo' own folks doan 'prove of you.’<br><br> That was as accurate a summing up of the situation as could be made<br> and Scarlett relapsed into infuriated silence. Yes, the conquerors<br> did approve of her and her family and her neighbors did not. She<br> knew all the things the town was saying about her. And now even<br> Peter disapproved of her to the point of not caring to be seen in<br> public with her. That was the last straw.<br><br> Heretofore she had been careless of public opinion, careless and a<br> little contemptuous. But Peter's words caused fierce resentment to<br> burn in her breast, drove her to a defensive position, made her<br> suddenly dislike her neighbors as much as she disliked the Yankees.<br><br> ‘Why should they care what I do?’ she thought. ‘They must think I<br> enjoy associating with Yankees and working like a field hand.<br> They're just making a hard job harder for me. But I don't care<br> what they think. I won't let myself care. I can't afford to care<br> now. But some day--some day--’<br><br> Oh some day! When there was security in her world again, then she<br> would sit back and fold her hands and be a great lady as Ellen had<br> been. She would be helpless and sheltered, as a lady should be,<br> and then everyone would approve of her. Oh, how grand she would be<br> when she had money again! Then she could permit herself to be kind<br> and gentle, as Ellen had been, and thoughtful of other people and<br> of the proprieties, to. She would not be driven by fears, day and<br> night, and life would be a placid, unhurried affair. She would<br> have time to play with her children and listen to their lessons.<br> There would be long warm afternoons when ladies would call and,<br> amid the rustlings of taffeta petticoats and the rhythmic harsh<br> cracklings of palmetto fans, she would serve tea and delicious<br> sandwiches and cakes and leisurely gossip the hours away. And she<br> would be so kind to those who were suffering misfortune, take<br> baskets to the poor and soup and jelly to the sick and ‘air’ those<br> less fortunate in her fine carriage. She would be a lady in the<br> true Southern manner, as her mother had been. And then, everyone<br> would love her as they had loved Ellen and they would say how<br> unselfish she was and call her ‘Lady Bountiful.’<br><br> Her pleasure in these thoughts of the future was undimmed by any<br> realization that she had no real desire to be unselfish or<br> charitable or kind. All she wanted was the reputation for<br> possessing these qualities. But the meshes of her brain were too<br> wide, too coarse, to filter such small differences. It was enough<br> that some day, when she had money, everyone would approve of her.<br><br> Some day! But not now. Not now, in spite of what anyone might say<br> of her. Now, there was no time to be a great lady.<br><br> Peter was as good as his word. Aunt Pitty did get into a state,<br> and Peter's misery developed overnight to such proportions that he<br> never drove the buggy again. Thereafter Scarlett drove alone and<br> the calluses which had begun to leave her palms came back again.<br><br> So the spring months went by, the cool rains of April passing into<br> the warm balm of green May weather. The weeks were packed with<br> work and worry and the handicaps of increasing pregnancy, with old<br> friends growing cooler and her family increasingly more kind, more<br> maddeningly solicitous and more completely blind to what was<br> driving her. During those days of anxiety and struggle there was<br> only one dependable, understanding person in her world, and that<br> person was Rhett Butler. It was odd that he of all people should<br> appear in this light, for he was as unstable as quicksilver and as<br> perverse as a demon fresh from the pit. But he gave her sympathy,<br> something she had never had from anyone and never expected from<br> him.<br><br> Frequently he was out of town on those mysterious trips to New<br> Orleans which he never explained but which she felt sure, in a<br> faintly jealous way, were connected with a woman--or women. But<br> after Uncle Peter's refusal to drive her, he remained in Atlanta<br> for longer and longer intervals.<br><br> While in town, he spent most of his time gambling in the rooms<br> above the Girl of the Period Saloon, or in Belle Watling's bar<br> hobnobbing with the wealthier of the Yankees and Carpetbaggers in<br> money-making schemes which made the townspeople detest him even<br> more than his cronies. He did not call at the house now, probably<br> in deference to the feelings of Frank and Pitty who would have been<br> outraged at a male caller while Scarlett was in a delicate<br> condition. But she met him by accident almost every day. Time and<br> again, he came riding up to her buggy when she was passing through<br> lonely stretches of Peachtree road and Decatur road where the mills<br> lay. He always drew rein and talked and sometimes he tied his<br> horse to the back of the buggy and drove her on her rounds. She<br> tired more easily these days than she liked to admit and she was<br> always silently grateful when he took the reins. He always left<br> her before they reached the town again but all Atlanta knew about<br> their meetings, and it gave the gossips something new to add to the<br> long list of Scarlett's affronts to the proprieties.<br><br> She wondered occasionally if these meetings were not more than<br> accidental. They became more and more numerous as the weeks went<br> by and as the tension in town heightened over negro outrages. But<br> why did he seek her out, now of all times when she looked her<br> worst? Certainly he had no designs upon her if he had ever had<br> any, and she was beginning to doubt even this. It had been months<br> since he made any joking references to their distressing scene at<br> the Yankee jail. He never mentioned Ashley and her love for him,<br> or made any coarse and ill-bred remarks about ‘coveting her.’ She<br> thought it best to let sleeping dogs lie, so she did not ask for an<br> explanation of their frequent meetings. And finally she decided<br> that, because he had little to do besides gamble and had few enough<br> nice friends in Atlanta, he sought her out solely for companionship's<br> sake.<br><br> Whatever his reason might be, she found his company most welcome.<br> He listened to her moans about lost customers and bad debts, the<br> swindling ways of Mr. Johnson and the incompetency of Hugh. He<br> applauded her triumphs, where Frank merely smiled indulgently and<br> Pitty said ‘Dear me!’ in a dazed manner. She was sure that he<br> frequently threw business her way, for he knew all the rich Yankees<br> and Carpetbaggers intimately, but he always denied being helpful.<br> She knew him for what he was and she never trusted him, but her<br> spirits always rose with pleasure at the sight of him riding around<br> the curve of a shady road on his big black horse. When he climbed<br> into the buggy and took the reins from her and threw her some<br> impertinent remark, she felt young and gay and attractive again,<br> for all her worries and her increasing bulk. She could talk to him<br> about almost everything, with no care for concealing her motives or<br> her real opinions and she never ran out of things to say as she did<br> with Frank--or even with Ashley, if she must be honest with<br> herself. But of course, in all her conversations with Ashley there<br> were so many things which could not be said, for honor's sake, that<br> the sheer force of them inhibited other remarks. It was comforting<br> to have a friend like Rhett, now that for some unaccountable reason<br> he had decided to be on good behavior with her. Very comforting,<br> for she had so few friends these days.<br><br> ‘Rhett,’ she asked stormily, shortly after Uncle Peter's ultimatum,<br> ‘why do folks in this town treat me so scurvily and talk about me<br> so? It's a toss-up who they talk worst about, me or the<br> Carpetbaggers! I've minded my own business and haven't done<br> anything wrong and--’<br><br> ‘If you haven't done anything wrong, it's because you haven't had<br> the opportunity, and perhaps they dimly realize it.’<br><br> ‘Oh, do be serious! They make me so mad. All I've done is try to<br> make a little money and--’<br><br> ‘All you've done is to be different from other women and you've<br> made a little success at it. As I've told you before, that is the<br> one unforgivable sin in any society. Be different and be damned!<br> Scarlett, the mere fact that you've made a success of your mill is<br> an insult to every man who hasn't succeeded. Remember, a well-bred<br> female's place is in the home and she should know nothing about<br> this busy, brutal world.’<br><br> ‘But if I had stayed in my home, I wouldn't have had any home left<br> to stay in.’<br><br> ‘The inference is that you should have starved genteelly and with<br> pride.’<br><br> ‘Oh, fiddle-dee-dee! But look at Mrs. Merriwether. She's selling<br> pies to Yankees and that's worse than running a sawmill, and Mrs.<br> Elsing takes in sewing and keeps boarders, and Fanny paints awful-<br> looking china things that nobody wants and everybody buys to help<br> her and--’<br><br> ‘But you miss the point, my pet. They aren't successful and so<br> they aren't affronting the hot Southern pride of their men folks.<br> The men can still say, 'Poor sweet sillies, how hard they try!<br> Well, I'll let them think they're helping.' And besides, the<br> ladies you mentioned don't enjoy having to work. They let it be<br> known that they are only doing it until some man comes along to<br> relieve them of their unwomanly burdens. And so everybody feels<br> sorry for them. But obviously you do like to work and obviously<br> you aren't going to let any man tend to your business for you, and<br> so no one can feel sorry for you. And Atlanta is never going to<br> forgive you for that. It's so pleasant to feel sorry for people.’<br><br> ‘I wish you'd be serious, sometimes.’<br><br> ‘Did you ever hear the Oriental proverb: 'The dogs bark but the<br> caravan passes on?' Let them bark, Scarlett. I fear nothing will<br> stop your caravan.’<br><br> ‘But why should they mind my making a little money?’<br><br> ‘You can't have everything, Scarlett. You can either make money in<br> your present unladylike manner and meet cold shoulders everywhere<br> you go, or you can be poor and genteel and have lots of friends.<br> You've made your choice.’<br><br> ‘I won't be poor,’ she said swiftly. ‘But--it is the right choice,<br> isn't it?’<br><br> ‘If it's money you want most.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I want money more than anything else in the world.’<br><br> ‘Then you've made the only choice. But there's a penalty attached,<br> as there is to most things you want. It's loneliness.’<br><br> That silenced her for a moment. It was true. When she stopped to<br> think about it, she was a little lonely--lonely for feminine<br> companionship. During the war years she had had Ellen to visit<br> when she felt blue. And since Ellen's death, there had always been<br> Melanie, though she and Melanie had nothing in common except the<br> hard work at Tara. Now there was no one, for Aunt Pitty had no<br> conception of life beyond her small round of gossip.<br><br> ‘I think--I think,’ she began hesitantly, ‘that I've always been<br> lonely where women were concerned. It isn't just my working that<br> makes Atlanta ladies dislike me. They just don't like me anyway.<br> No woman ever really liked me, except Mother. Even my sisters.<br> I don't know why, but even before the war, even before I married<br> Charlie, ladies didn't seem to approve of anything I did--’<br><br> ‘You forget Mrs. Wilkes,’ said Rhett and his eyes gleamed<br> maliciously. ‘She has always approved of you up to the hilt.<br> I daresay she'd approve of anything you did, short of murder.’<br><br> Scarlett thought grimly: ‘She's even approved of murder,’ and she<br> laughed contemptuously.<br><br> ‘Oh, Melly!’ she said, and then, ruefully: ‘It's certainly not to<br> my credit that Melly is the only woman who approves of me, for she<br> hasn't the sense of a guinea hen. If she had any sense--’ She<br> stopped in some confusion.<br><br> ‘If she had any sense, she'd realize a few things and she couldn't<br> approve,’ Rhett finished. ‘Well, you know more about that than I<br> do, of course.’<br><br> ‘Oh, damn your memory and your bad manners!’<br><br> ‘I'll pass over your unjustified rudeness with the silence it<br> deserves and return to our former subject. Make up your mind to<br> this. If you are different, you are isolated, not only from people<br> of your own age but from those of your parents' generation and from<br> your children's generation too. They'll never understand you and<br> they'll be shocked no matter what you do. But your grandparents<br> would probably be proud of you and say: 'There's a chip off the<br> old block,' and your grandchildren will sigh enviously and say:<br> 'What an old rip Grandma must have been!' and they'll try to be<br> like you.’<br><br> Scarlett laughed with amusement.<br><br> ‘Sometimes you do hit on the truth! Now there was my Grandma<br> Robillard. Mammy used to hold her over my head whenever I was<br> naughty. Grandma was as cold as an icicle and strict about her<br> manners and everybody else's manners, but she married three times<br> and had any number of duels fought over her and she wore rouge and<br> the most shockingly low-cut dresses and no--well, er--not much<br> under her dresses.’<br><br> ‘And you admired her tremendously, for all that you tried to be<br> like your mother! I had a grandfather on the Butler side who was a<br> pirate.’<br><br> ‘Not really! A walk-the-plank kind?’<br><br> ‘I daresay he made people walk the plank if there was any money to<br> be made that way. At any rate, he made enough money to leave my<br> father quite wealthy. But the family always referred to him<br> carefully as a 'sea captain.' He was killed in a saloon brawl long<br> before I was born. His death was, needless to say, a great relief<br> to his children, for the old gentleman was drunk most of the time<br> and when in his cups was apt to forget that he was a retired sea<br> captain and give reminiscences that curled his children's hair.<br> However, I admired him and tried to copy him far more than I ever<br> did my father, for Father is an amiable gentleman full of honorable<br> habits and pious saws--so you see how it goes. I'm sure your<br> children won't approve of you, Scarlett, any more than Mrs.<br> Merriwether and Mrs. Elsing and their broods approve of you now.<br> Your children will probably be soft, prissy creatures, as the<br> children of hard-bitten characters usually are. And to make them<br> worse, you, like every other mother, are probably determined that<br> they shall never know the hardships you've known. And that's all<br> wrong. Hardships make or break people. So you'll have to wait for<br> approval from your grandchildren.’<br><br> ‘I wonder what our grandchildren will be like!’<br><br> ‘Are you suggesting by that 'our' that you and I will have mutual<br> grandchildren? Fie, Mrs. Kennedy!’<br><br> Scarlett, suddenly conscious of her error of speech, went red. It<br> was more than his joking words that shamed her, for she was<br> suddenly aware again of her thickening body. In no way had either<br> of them ever hinted at her condition and she had always kept the<br> lap robe high under her armpits when with him, even on warm days,<br> comforting herself in the usual feminine manner with the belief<br> that she did not show at all when thus covered, and she was<br> suddenly sick with quick rage at her own condition and shame that<br> he should know.<br><br> ‘You get out of this buggy, you dirty-minded varmit,’ she said, her<br> voice shaking.<br><br> ‘I'll do nothing of the kind,’ he returned calmly. ‘It'll be dark<br> before you get home and there's a new colony of darkies living in<br> tents and shanties near the next spring, mean niggers I've been<br> told, and I see no reason why you should give the impulsive Ku Klux<br> a cause for putting on their nightshirts and riding abroad this<br> evening.’<br><br> ‘Get out!’ she cried, tugging at the reins and suddenly nausea<br> overwhelmed her. He stopped the horse quickly, passed her two<br> clean handkerchiefs and held her head over the side of the buggy<br> with some skill. The afternoon sun, slanting low through the newly<br> leaved trees, spun sickeningly for a few moments in a swirl of gold<br> and green. When the spell had passed, she put her head in her<br> hands and cried from sheer mortification. Not only had she vomited<br> before a man--in itself as horrible a contretemps as could overtake<br> a woman--but by doing so, the humiliating fact of her pregnancy<br> must now be evident. She felt that she could never look him in the<br> face again. To have this happen with him, of all people, with<br> Rhett who had no respect for women! She cried, expecting some<br> coarse and jocular remark from him which she would never be able to<br> forget.<br><br> ‘Don't be a fool,’ he said quietly. ‘And you are a fool, if you<br> are crying for shame. Come, Scarlett, don't be a child. Surely<br> you must know that, not being blind, I knew you were pregnant.’<br><br> She said ‘Oh’ in a stunned voice and tightened her fingers over her<br> crimson face. The word itself horrified her. Frank always<br> referred to her pregnancy embarrassedly as ‘your condition,’ Gerald<br> had been wont to say delicately ‘in the family way,’ when he had to<br> mention such matters, and ladies genteelly referred to pregnancy as<br> being ‘in a fix.’<br><br> ‘You are a child if you thought I didn't know, for all your<br> smothering yourself under that hot lap robe. Of course, I knew.<br> Why else do you think I've been--’<br><br> He stopped suddenly and a silence fell between them. He picked up<br> the reins and clucked to the horse. He went on talking quietly and<br> as his drawl fell pleasantly on her ears, some of the color faded<br> from her down-tucked face.<br><br> ‘I didn't think you could be so shocked, Scarlett. I thought you<br> were a sensible person and I'm disappointed. Can it be possible<br> that modesty still lingers in your breast? I'm afraid I'm not a<br> gentleman to have mentioned the matter. And I know I'm not a<br> gentleman, in view of the fact that pregnant women do not embarrass<br> me as they should. I find it possible to treat them as normal<br> creatures and not look at the ground or the sky or anywhere else in<br> the universe except their waist lines--and then cast at them those<br> furtive glances I've always thought the height of indecency. Why<br> should I? It's a perfectly normal state. The Europeans are far<br> more sensible than we are. They compliment expectant mothers upon<br> their expectations. While I wouldn't advise going that far, still<br> it's more sensible than our way of trying to ignore it. It's a<br> normal state and women should be proud of it, instead of hiding<br> behind closed doors as if they'd committed a crime.’<br><br> ‘Proud!’ she cried in a strangled voice. ‘Proud--ugh!’<br><br> ‘Aren't you proud to be having a child?’<br><br> ‘Oh dear God, no! I--I hate babies!’<br><br> ‘You mean--Frank's baby.’<br><br> ‘No--anybody's baby.’<br><br> For a moment she went sick again at this new error of speech, but<br> his voice went on as easily as though he had not marked it.<br><br> ‘Then we're different. I like babies.’<br><br> ‘You like them?’ she cried, looking up, so startled at the<br> statement that she forgot her embarrassment. ‘What a liar you<br> are!’<br><br> ‘I like babies and I like little children, till they begin to grow<br> up and acquire adult habits of thought and adult abilities to lie<br> and cheat and be dirty. That can't be news to you. You know I<br> like Wade Hampton a lot, for all that he isn't the boy he ought to<br> be.’<br><br> That was true, thought Scarlett, suddenly marveling. He did seem<br> to enjoy playing with Wade and often brought him presents.<br><br> ‘Now that we've brought this dreadful subject into the light and<br> you admit that you expect a baby some time in the not too distant<br> future, I'll say something I've been wanting to say for weeks--two<br> things. The first is that it's dangerous for you to drive alone.<br> You know it. You've been told it often enough. If you don't care<br> personally whether or not you are raped, you might consider the<br> consequences. Because of your obstinacy, you may get yourself into<br> a situation where your gallant fellow townsmen will be forced to<br> avenge you by stringing up a few darkies. And that will bring the<br> Yankees down on them and someone will probably get hanged. Has it<br> ever occurred to you that perhaps one of the reasons the ladies do<br> not like you is that your conduct may cause the neck-stretching of<br> their sons and husbands? And furthermore, if the Ku Klux handles<br> many more negroes, the Yankees are going to tighten up on Atlanta<br> in a way that will make Sherman's conduct look angelic. I know<br> what I'm talking about, for I'm hand in glove with the Yankees.<br> Shameful to state, they treat me as one of them and I hear them<br> talk openly. They mean to stamp out the Ku Klux if it means<br> burning the whole town again and hanging every male over ten. That<br> would hurt you, Scarlett. You might lose money. And there's no<br> telling where a prairie fire will stop, once it gets started.<br> Confiscation of property, higher taxes, fines for suspected women--<br> I've heard them all suggested. The Ku Klux--’<br><br> ‘Do you know any Ku Klux? Is Tommy Wellburn or Hugh or--’<br><br> He shrugged impatiently.<br><br> ‘How should I know? I'm a renegade, a turncoat, a Scallawag.<br> Would I be likely to know? But I do know men who are suspected by<br> the Yankees and one false move from them and they are as good as<br> hanged. While I know you would have no regrets at getting your<br> neighbors on the gallows, I do believe you'd regret losing your<br> mills. I see by the stubborn look on your face that you do not<br> believe me and my words are falling on stony ground. So all I can<br> say is, keep that pistol of yours handy--and when I'm in town, I'll<br> try to be on hand to drive you.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, do you really--is it to protect me that you--’<br><br> ‘Yes, my dear, it is my much advertised chivalry that makes me<br> protect you.’ The mocking light began to dance in his black eyes<br> and all signs of earnestness fled from his face. ‘And why?<br> Because of my deep love for you, Mrs. Kennedy. Yes, I have<br> silently hungered and thirsted for you and worshipped you from<br> afar; but being an honorable man, like Mr. Ashley Wilkes, I have<br> concealed it from you. You are, alas, Frank's wife and honor has<br> forbidden my telling this to you. But even as Mr. Wilkes' honor<br> cracks occasionally, so mine is cracking now and I reveal my secret<br> passion and my--’<br><br> ‘Oh, for God's sake, hush!’ interrupted Scarlett, annoyed as usual<br> when he made her look like a conceited fool, and not caring to have<br> Ashley and his honor become the subject of further conversation.<br> ‘What was the other thing you wanted to tell me?’<br><br> ‘What! You change the subject when I am baring a loving but<br> lacerated heart? Well, the other thing is this.’ The mocking<br> light died out of his eyes again and his face was dark and quiet.<br><br> ‘I want you to do something about this horse. He's stubborn and<br> he's got a mouth as tough as iron. Tires you to drive him, doesn't<br> it? Well, if he chose to bolt, you couldn't possibly stop him.<br> And if you turned over in a ditch, it might kill your baby and you<br> too. You ought to get the heaviest curb bit you can, or else let<br> me swap him for a gentle horse with a more sensitive mouth.’<br><br> She looked up into his blank, smooth face and suddenly her<br> irritation fell away, even as her embarrassment had disappeared<br> after the conversation about her pregnancy. He had been kind, a<br> few moments before, to put her at her ease when she was wishing<br> that she were dead. And he was being kinder now and very<br> thoughtful about the horse. She felt a rush of gratitude to him<br> and she wondered why he could not always be this way.<br><br> ‘The horse is hard to drive,’ she agreed meekly. ‘Sometimes my<br> arms ache all night from tugging at him. You do what you think<br> best about him, Rhett.’<br><br> His eyes sparkled wickedly.<br><br> ‘That sounds very sweet and feminine, Mrs. Kennedy. Not in your<br> usual masterful vein at all. Well, it only takes proper handling<br> to make a clinging vine out of you.’<br><br> She scowled and her temper came back.<br><br> ‘You will get out of this buggy this time, or I will hit you with<br> the whip. I don't know why I put up with you--why I try to be nice<br> to you. You have no manners. You have no morals. You are nothing<br> but a-- Well, get out. I mean it.’<br><br> But when he had climbed down and untied his horse from the back of<br> the buggy and stood in the twilight road, grinning tantalizingly at<br> her, she could not smother her own grin as she drove off.<br><br> Yes, he was coarse, he was tricky, he was unsafe to have dealings<br> with, and you never could tell when the dull weapon you put into<br> his hands in an unguarded moment might turn into the keenest of<br> blades. But, after all, he was as stimulating as--well, as a<br> surreptitious glass of brandy!<br><br> During these months Scarlett had learned the use of brandy. When<br> she came home in the late afternoons, damp from the rain, cramped<br> and aching from long hours in the buggy, nothing sustained her<br> except the thought of the bottle hidden in her top bureau drawer,<br> locked against Mammy's prying eyes. Dr. Meade had not thought to<br> warn her that a woman in her condition should not drink, for it<br> never occurred to him that a decent woman would drink anything<br> stronger than scuppernong wine. Except, of course, a glass of<br> champagne at a wedding or a hot toddy when confined to bed with a<br> hard cold. Of course, there were unfortunate women who drank, to<br> the eternal disgrace of their families, just as there were women<br> who were insane or divorced or who believed, with Miss Susan B.<br> Anthony, that women should have the vote. But as much as the<br> doctor disapproved of Scarlett, he never suspected her of drinking.<br><br> Scarlett had found that a drink of neat brandy before supper helped<br> immeasurably and she would always chew coffee or gargle cologne to<br> disguise the smell. Why were people so silly about women drinking,<br> when men could and did get reeling drunk whenever they wanted to?<br> Sometimes when Frank lay snoring beside her and sleep would not<br> come, when she lay tossing, torn with fears of poverty, dreading<br> the Yankees, homesick for Tara and yearning for Ashley, she thought<br> she would go crazy were it not for the brandy bottle. And when the<br> pleasant familiar warmth stole through her veins, her troubles<br> began to fade. After three drinks, she could always say to<br> herself: ‘I'll think of these things tomorrow when I can stand<br> them better.’<br><br> But there were some nights when even brandy would not still the<br> ache in her heart, the ache that was even stronger than fear of<br> losing the mills, the ache to see Tara again. Atlanta, with its<br> noises, its new buildings, its strange faces, its narrow streets<br> crowded with horses and wagons and bustling crowds sometimes seemed<br> to stifle her. She loved Atlanta but--oh, for the sweet peace and<br> country quiet of Tara, the red fields and the dark pines about it!<br> Oh, to be back at Tara, no matter how hard the life might be! And<br> to be near Ashley, just to see him, to hear him speak, to be<br> sustained by the knowledge of his love! Each letter from Melanie,<br> saying that they were well, each brief note from Will reporting<br> about the plowing, the planting, the growing of the cotton made her<br> long anew to be home again.<br><br> I'll go home in June. I can't do anything here after that. I'll<br> go home for a couple of months, she thought, and her heart would<br> rise. She did go home in June but not as she longed to go, for<br> early in that month came a brief message from Will that Gerald was<br> dead.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XXXIX<br><br> <br> The train was very late and the long, deeply blue twilight of June<br> was settling over the countryside when Scarlett alighted in<br> Jonesboro. Yellow gleams of lamplight showed in the stores and<br> houses which remained in the village, but they were few. Here and<br> there were wide gaps between the buildings on the main street where<br> dwellings had been shelled or burned. Ruined houses with shell<br> holes in their roofs and half the walls torn away stared at her,<br> silent and dark. A few saddle horses and mule teams were hitched<br> outside the wooden awning of Bullard's store. The dusty red road<br> was empty and lifeless, and the only sounds in the village were a<br> few whoops and drunken laughs that floated on the still twilight<br> air from a saloon far down the street.<br><br> The depot had not been rebuilt since it was burned in the battle<br> and in its place was only a wooden shelter, with no sides to keep<br> out the weather. Scarlett walked under it and sat down on one of<br> the empty kegs that were evidently put there for seats. She peered<br> up and down the street for Will Benteen. Will should have been<br> here to meet her. He should have known she would take the first<br> train possible after receiving his laconic message that Gerald was<br> dead.<br><br> She had come so hurriedly that she had in her small carpetbag only<br> a nightgown and a tooth brush, not even a change of underwear. She<br> was uncomfortable in the tight black dress she had borrowed from<br> Mrs. Meade, for she had had no time to get mourning clothes for<br> herself. Mrs. Meade was thin now, and Scarlett's pregnancy being<br> advanced, the dress was doubly uncomfortable. Even in her sorrow<br> at Gerald's death, she did not forget the appearance she was making<br> and she looked down at her body with distaste. Her figure was<br> completely gone and her face and ankles were puffy. Heretofore she<br> had not cared very much how she looked but now that she would see<br> Ashley within the hour she cared greatly. Even in her heartbreak,<br> she shrank from the thought of facing him when she was carrying<br> another man's child. She loved him and he loved her, and this<br> unwanted child now seemed to her a proof of infidelity to that<br> love. But much as she disliked having him see her with the<br> slenderness gone from her waist and the lightness from her step, it<br> was something she could not escape now.<br><br> She patted her foot impatiently. Will should have met her. Of<br> course, she could go over to Bullard's and inquire after him or ask<br> someone there to drive her over to Tara, should she find he had<br> been unable to come. But she did not want to go to Bullard's. It<br> was Saturday night and probably half the men of the County would be<br> there. She did not want to display her condition in this poorly<br> fitting black dress which accentuated rather than hid her figure.<br> And she did not want to hear the kindly sympathy that would be<br> poured out about Gerald. She did not want sympathy. She was<br> afraid she would cry if anyone even mentioned his name to her. And<br> she wouldn't cry. She knew if she once began it would be like the<br> time she cried into the horse's mane, that dreadful night when<br> Atlanta fell and Rhett had left her on the dark road outside the<br> town, terrible tears that tore her heart and could not be stopped.<br><br> No, she wouldn't cry! She felt the lump in her throat rising<br> again, as it had done so often since the news came, but crying<br> wouldn't do any good. It would only confuse and weaken her. Why,<br> oh, why hadn't Will or Melanie or the girls written her that Gerald<br> was ailing? She would have taken the first train to Tara to care<br> for him, brought a doctor from Atlanta if necessary. The fools--<br> all of them! Couldn't they manage anything without her? She<br> couldn't be in two places at once and the good Lord knew she was<br> doing her best for them all in Atlanta.<br><br> She twisted about on the keg, becoming nervous and fidgety as Will<br> still did not come. Where was he? Then she heard the scrunching<br> of cinders on the railroad tracks behind her and, twisting her<br> body, she saw Alex Fontaine crossing the tracks toward a wagon, a<br> sack of oats on his shoulder.<br><br> ‘Good Lord! Isn't that you, Scarlett?’ he cried, dropping the sack<br> and running to take her hand, pleasure written all over his bitter,<br> swarthy little face. ‘I'm so glad to see you. I saw Will over at<br> the blacksmith's shop, getting the horse shod. The train was late<br> and he thought he'd have time. Shall I run fetch him?’<br><br> ‘Yes, please, Alex,’ she said, smiling in spite of her sorrow. It<br> was good to see a County face again.<br><br> ‘Oh--er--Scarlett,’ he began awkwardly, still holding her hand,<br> ‘I'm mighty sorry about your father.’<br><br> ‘Thank you,’ she replied, wishing he had not said it. His words<br> brought up Gerald's florid face and bellowing voice so clearly.<br><br> ‘If it's any comfort to you, Scarlett, we're mighty proud of him<br> around here,’ Alex continued, dropping her hand. ‘He--well, we<br> figure he died like a soldier and in a soldier's cause.’<br><br> Now what did he mean by that, she thought confusedly. A soldier?<br> Had someone shot him? Had he gotten into a fight with the<br> Scallawags as Tony had? But she mustn't hear more. She would cry<br> if she talked about him and she mustn't cry, not until she was<br> safely in the wagon with Will and out in the country where no<br> stranger could see her. Will wouldn't matter. He was just like a<br> brother.<br><br> ‘Alex, I don't want to talk about it,’ she said shortly.<br><br> ‘I don't blame you one bit, Scarlett,’ said Alex while the dark<br> blood of anger flooded his face. ‘If it was my sister, I'd--well,<br> Scarlett, I've never yet said a harsh word about any woman, but<br> personally I think somebody ought to take a rawhide whip to<br> Suellen.’<br><br> What foolishness was he talking about now, she wondered. What had<br> Suellen to do with it all?<br><br> ‘Everybody around here feels the same way about her, I'm sorry to<br> say. Will's the only one who takes up for her--and, of course,<br> Miss Melanie, but she's a saint and won't see bad in anyone and--’<br><br> ‘I said I didn't want to talk about it,’ she said coldly but Alex<br> did not seem rebuffed. He looked as though he understood her<br> rudeness and that was annoying. She didn't want to hear bad<br> tidings about her own family from an outsider, didn't want him to<br> know of her ignorance of what had happened. Why hadn't Will sent<br> her the full details?<br><br> She wished Alex wouldn't look at her so hard. She felt that he<br> realized her condition and it embarrassed her. But what Alex was<br> thinking as he peered at her in the twilight was that her face had<br> changed so completely he wondered how he had ever recognized her.<br> Perhaps it was because she was going to have a baby. Women did<br> look like the devil at such times. And, of course, she must be<br> feeling badly about old man O'Hara. She had been his pet. But,<br> no, the change was deeper than that. She really looked as if she<br> had three square meals a day. And the hunted-animal look had<br> partly gone from her eyes. Now, the eyes which had been fearful<br> and desperate were hard. There was an air of command, assurance<br> and determination about her, even when she smiled. Bet she led old<br> Frank a merry life! Yes, she had changed. She was a handsome<br> woman, to be sure, but all that pretty, sweet softness had gone<br> from her face and that flattering way of looking up at a man, like<br> he knew more than God Almighty, had utterly vanished.<br><br> Well, hadn't they all changed? Alex looked down at his rough<br> clothes and his face fell into its usual bitter lines. Sometimes<br> at night when he lay awake, wondering how his mother was going to<br> get that operation and how poor dead Joe's little boy was going to<br> get an education and how he was going to get money for another<br> mule, he wished the war was still going on, wished it had gone on<br> forever. They didn't know their luck then. There was always<br> something to eat in the army, even if it was just corn bread,<br> always somebody to give orders and none of this torturing sense of<br> facing problems that couldn't be solved--nothing to bother about in<br> the army except getting killed. And then there was Dimity Munroe.<br> Alex wanted to marry her and he knew he couldn't when so many were<br> already looking to him for support. He had loved her for so long<br> and now the roses were fading from her cheeks and the joy from her<br> eyes. If only Tony hadn't had to run away to Texas. Another man<br> on the place would make all the difference in the world. His<br> lovable bad-tempered little brother, penniless somewhere in the<br> West. Yes, they had all changed. And why not? He sighed heavily.<br><br> ‘I haven't thanked you for what you and Frank did for Tony,’ he<br> said. ‘It was you who helped him get away, wasn't it? It was fine<br> of you. I heard in a roundabout way that he was safe in Texas. I<br> was afraid to write and ask you--but did you or Frank lend him any<br> money? I want to repay--’<br><br> ‘Oh, Alex, please hush! Not now!’ cried Scarlett. For once, money<br> meant nothing to her.<br><br> Alex was silent for a moment.<br><br> ‘I'll get Will for you,’ he said, ‘and we'll all be over tomorrow<br> for the funeral.’<br><br> As he picked up the sack of oats and turned away, a wobbly-wheeled<br> wagon swayed out of a side street and creaked up to them. Will<br> called from the seat: ‘I'm sorry I'm late, Scarlett.’<br><br> Climbing awkwardly down from the wagon, he stumped toward her and,<br> bending, kissed her cheek. Will had never kissed her before, had<br> never failed to precede her name with ‘Miss’ and, while it<br> surprised her, it warmed her heart and pleased her very much. He<br> lifted her carefully over the wheel and into the wagon and, looking<br> down, she saw that it was the same old rickety wagon in which she<br> had fled from Atlanta. How had it ever held together so long?<br> Will must have kept it patched up very well. It made her slightly<br> sick to look at it and to remember that night. If it took the<br> shoes off her feet or food from Aunt Pitty's table, she'd see that<br> there was a new wagon at Tara and this one burned.<br><br> Will did not speak at first and Scarlett was grateful. He threw<br> his battered straw hat into the back of the wagon, clucked to the<br> horse and they moved off. Will was just the same, lank and<br> gangling, pink of hair, mild of eye, patient as a draft animal.<br><br> They left the village behind and turned into the red road to Tara.<br> A faint pink still lingered about the edges of the sky and fat<br> feathery clouds were tinged with gold and palest green. The<br> stillness of the country twilight came down about them as calming<br> as a prayer. How had she ever borne it, she thought, away for all<br> these months, away from the fresh smell of country air, the plowed<br> earth and the sweetness of summer nights? The moist red earth<br> smelled so good, so familiar, so friendly, she wanted to get out<br> and scoop up a handful. The honeysuckle which draped the gullied<br> red sides of the road in tangled greenery was piercingly fragrant<br> as always after rain, the sweetest perfume in the world. Above<br> their heads a flock of chimney swallows whirled suddenly on swift<br> wings and now and then a rabbit scurried startled across the road,<br> his white tail bobbing like an eiderdown powder puff. She saw with<br> pleasure that the cotton stood well, as they passed between plowed<br> fields where the green bushes reared themselves sturdily out of the<br> red earth. How beautiful all this was! The soft gray mist in the<br> swampy bottoms, the red earth and growing cotton, the sloping<br> fields with curving green rows and the black pines rising behind<br> everything like sable walls. How had she ever stayed in Atlanta so<br> long?<br><br> ‘Scarlett, before I tell you about Mr. O'Hara--and I want to tell<br> you everything before you get home--I want to ask your opinion on a<br> matter. I figger you're the head of the house now.’<br><br> ‘What is it, Will?’<br><br> He turned his mild sober gaze on her for a moment.<br><br> ‘I just wanted your approval to my marryin' Suellen.’<br><br> Scarlett clutched the seat, so surprised that she almost fell<br> backwards. Marry Suellen! She'd never thought of anybody marrying<br> Suellen since she had taken Frank Kennedy from her. Who would have<br> Suellen?<br><br> ‘Goodness, Will!’<br><br> ‘Then I take it you don't mind?’<br><br> ‘Mind? No, but-- Why, Will, you've taken my breath away! You<br> marry Suellen? Will, I always thought you were sweet on Carreen.’<br><br> Will kept his eyes on the horse and flapped the reins. His profile<br> did not change but she thought he sighed slightly.<br><br> ‘Maybe I was,’ he said.<br><br> ‘Well, won't she have you?’<br><br> ‘I never asked her.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Will, you're a fool. Ask her. She's worth two of Suellen!’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, you don't know a lot of things that's been going on at<br> Tara. You ain't favored us with much of your attention these last<br> months.’<br><br> ‘I haven't, haven't I?’ she flared. ‘What do you suppose I've been<br> doing in Atlanta? Riding around in a coach and four and going to<br> balls? Haven't I sent you money every month? Haven't I paid the<br> taxes and fixed the roof and bought the new plow and the mules?<br> Haven't--’<br><br> ‘Now, don't fly off the handle and get your Irish up,’ he<br> interrupted imperturbably. ‘If anybody knows what you've done, I<br> do, and it's been two men's work.’<br><br> Slightly mollified, she questioned, ‘Well then, what do you mean?’<br><br> ‘Well, you've kept the roof over us and food in the pantry and I<br> ain't denyin' that, but you ain't given much thought to what's been<br> goin' on in anybody's head here at Tara. I ain't blamin' you,<br> Scarlett. That's just your way. You warn't never very much<br> interested in what was in folks' heads. But what I'm tryin' to<br> tell you is that I didn't never ask Miss Carreen because I knew it<br> wouldn't be no use. She's been like a little sister to me and I<br> guess she talks to me plainer than to anybody in the world. But<br> she never got over that dead boy and she never will. And I might<br> as well tell you now she's aimin' to go in a convent over to<br> Charleston.’<br><br> ‘Are you joking?’<br><br> ‘Well, I knew it would take you back and I just want to ask you,<br> Scarlett, don't you argue with her about it or scold her or laugh<br> at her. Let her go. It's all she wants now. Her heart's broken.’<br><br> ‘But God's nightgown! Lots of people's hearts have been broken and<br> they didn't run off to convents. Look at me. I lost a husband.’<br><br> ‘But your heart warn't broken,’ Will said calmly and, picking up a<br> straw from the bottom of the wagon, he put it in his mouth and<br> chewed slowly. That remark took the wind out of her. As always<br> when she heard the truth spoken, no matter how unpalatable it was,<br> basic honesty forced her to acknowledge it as truth. She was<br> silent a moment, trying to accustom herself to the idea of Carreen<br> as a nun.<br><br> ‘Promise you won't fuss at her.’<br><br> ‘Oh, well, I promise,’ and then she looked at him with a new<br> understanding and some amazement. Will had loved Carreen, loved<br> her now enough to take her part and make her retreat easy. And yet<br> he wanted to marry Suellen.<br><br> ‘Well, what's all this about Suellen? You don't care for her, do<br> you?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, I do in a way,’ he said removing the straw and surveying<br> it as if it were highly interesting. ‘Suellen ain't as bad as you<br> think, Scarlett. I think we'll get along right well. The only<br> trouble with Suellen is that she needs a husband and some children<br> and that's just what every woman needs.’<br><br> The wagon jolted over the rutty road and for a few minutes while<br> the two sat silent Scarlett's mind was busy. There must be<br> something more to it than appeared on the surface, something<br> deeper, more important, to make the mild and soft-spoken Will want<br> to marry a complaining nagger like Suellen.<br><br> ‘You haven't told me the real reason, Will. If I'm head of the<br> family, I've got a right to know.’<br><br> ‘That's right,’ said Will, ‘and I guess you'll understand. I can't<br> leave Tara. It's home to me, Scarlett, the only real home I ever<br> knew and I love every stone of it. I've worked on it like it was<br> mine. And when you put out work on somethin', you come to love it.<br> You know what I mean?’<br><br> She knew what he meant and her heart went out in a surge of warm<br> affection for him, hearing him say he, too, loved the thing she<br> loved best.<br><br> ‘And I figger it this way. With your pa gone and Carreen a nun,<br> there'll be just me and Suellen left here and, of course, I<br> couldn't live on at Tara without marryin' Suellen. You know how<br> folks talk.’<br><br> ‘But--but Will, there's Melanie and Ashley--’<br><br> At Ashley's name he turned and looked at her, his pale eyes<br> unfathomable. She had the old feeling that Will knew all about her<br> and Ashley, understood all and did not either censure or approve.<br><br> ‘They'll be goin' soon.’<br><br> ‘Going? Where? Tara is their home as well as yours.’<br><br> ‘No, it ain't their home. That's just what's eatin' on Ashley. It<br> ain't his home and he don't feel like he's earnin' his keep. He's<br> a mighty pore farmer and he knows it. God knows he tries his best<br> but he warn't cut out for farmin' and you know it as well as I do.<br> If he splits kindlin', like as not he'll slice off his foot. He<br> can't no more keep a plow straight in a furrow than little Beau<br> can, and what he don't know about makin' things grow would fill a<br> book. It ain't his fault. He just warn't bred for it. And it<br> worries him that he's a man livin' at Tara on a woman's charity and<br> not givin' much in return.’<br><br> ‘Charity? Has he ever said--’<br><br> ‘No, he's never said a word. You know Ashley. But I can tell.<br> Last night when we were sittin' up with your pa, I tole him I had<br> asked Suellen and she'd said Yes. And then Ashley said that<br> relieved him because he'd been feelin' like a dog, stayin' on at<br> Tara, and he knew he and Miss Melly would have to keep stayin' on,<br> now that Mr. O'Hara was dead, just to keep folks from talkin' about<br> me and Suellen. So then he told me he was aimin' to leave Tara and<br> get work.’<br><br> ‘Work? What kind? Where?’<br><br> ‘I don't know exactly what he'll do but he said he was goin' up<br> North. He's got a Yankee friend in New York who wrote him about<br> workin' in a bank up there.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no!’ cried Scarlett from the bottom of her heart and, at the<br> cry, Will gave her the same look as before.<br><br> ‘Maybe 'twould be better all 'round if he did go North.’<br><br> ‘No! No! I don't think so.’<br><br> Her mind was working feverishly. Ashley couldn't go North! She<br> might never see him again. Even though she had not seen him in<br> months, had not spoken to him alone since that fateful scene in the<br> orchard, there had not been a day when she had not thought of him,<br> been glad he was sheltered under her roof. She had never sent a<br> dollar to Will that she had not been pleased that it would make<br> Ashley's life easier. Of course, he wasn't any good as a farmer.<br> Ashley was bred for better things, she thought proudly. He was<br> born to rule, to live in a large house, ride fine horses, read<br> books of poetry and tell negroes what to do. That there were no<br> more mansions and horses and negroes and few books did not alter<br> matters. Ashley wasn't bred to plow and split rails. No wonder he<br> wanted to leave Tara.<br><br> But she could not let him go away from Georgia. If necessary, she<br> would bully Frank into giving him a job in the store, make Frank<br> turn off the boy he now had behind the counter. But, no--Ashley's<br> place was no more behind a counter than it was behind a plow. A<br> Wilkes a shopkeeper! Oh, never that! There must be something--<br> why, her mill of course! Her relief at the thought was so great<br> that she smiled. But would he accept an offer from her? Would he<br> still think it was charity? She must manage it so he would think<br> he was doing her a favor. She would discharge Mr. Johnson and put<br> Ashley in charge of the old mill while Hugh operated the new one.<br> She would explain to Ashley how Frank's ill health and the pressure<br> of work at the store kept him from helping her, and she would plead<br> her condition as another reason why she needed his help.<br><br> She would make him realize somehow that she couldn't do without his<br> aid at this time. And she would give him a half-interest in the<br> mill, if he would only take it over--anything just to have him near<br> her, anything to see that bright smile light up his face, anything<br> for the chance of catching an unguarded look in his eyes that<br> showed he still cared. But, she promised herself, never, never<br> would she again try to prod him into words of love, never again<br> would she try to make him throw away that foolish honor he valued<br> more than love. Somehow, she must delicately convey to him this<br> new resolution of hers. Otherwise he might refuse, fearing another<br> scene such as that last terrible one had been.<br><br> ‘I can get him something to do in Atlanta,’ she said.<br><br> ‘Well, that's yours and Ashley's business,’ said Will and put the<br> straw back in his mouth. ‘Giddap, Sherman. Now, Scarlett.<br> there's somethin' else I've got to ask you before I tell you about<br> your pa. I won't have you lightin' into Suellen. What she's done,<br> she's done, and you snatchin' her baldheaded won't bring Mr. O'Hara<br> back. Besides she honestly thought she was actin' for the best!’<br><br> ‘I wanted to ask you about that. What is all this about Suellen?<br> Alex talked riddles and said she ought to be whipped. What has she<br> done?’<br><br> ‘Yes, folks are pretty riled up about her. Everybody I run into<br> this afternoon in Jonesboro was promisin' to cut her dead the next<br> time they seen her, but maybe they'll get over it. Now, promise me<br> you won't light into her. I won't be havin' no quarrelin' tonight<br> with Mr. O'Hara layin' dead in the parlor.’<br><br> HE won't be having any quarreling! thought Scarlett, indignantly.<br> He talks like Tara was his already!<br><br> And then she thought of Gerald, dead in the parlor, and suddenly<br> she began to cry, cry in bitter, gulping sobs. Will put his arm<br> around her, drew her comfortably close and said nothing.<br><br> As they jolted slowly down the darkening road, her head on his<br> shoulder, her bonnet askew, she had forgotten the Gerald of the<br> last two years, the vague old gentleman who stared at doors waiting<br> for a woman who would never enter. She was remembering the vital,<br> virile old man with his mane of crisp white hair, his bellowing<br> cheerfulness, his stamping boots, his clumsy jokes, his generosity.<br> She remembered how, as a child, he had seemed the most wonderful<br> man in the world, this blustering father who carried her before him<br> on his saddle when he jumped fences, turned her up and paddled her<br> when she was naughty, and then cried when she cried and gave her<br> quarters to get her to hush. She remembered him coming home from<br> Charleston and Atlanta laden with gifts that were never appropriate,<br> remembered too, with a faint smile through tears, how he came home<br> in the wee hours from Court Day at Jonesboro, drunk as seven earls,<br> jumping fences, his rollicking voice raised in ‘The Wearin' o' the<br> Green.’ And how abashed he was, facing Ellen on the morning after.<br> Well, he was with Ellen now.<br><br> ‘Why didn't you write me that he was ill? I'd have come so fast--’<br><br> ‘He warn't ill, not a minute. Here, honey, take my handkerchief<br> and I'll tell you all about it.’<br><br> She blew her nose on his bandanna, for she had come from Atlanta<br> without even a handkerchief, and settled back into the crook of<br> Will's arm. How nice Will was. Nothing ever upset him.<br><br> ‘Well, it was this way, Scarlett. You been sendin' us money right<br> along and Ashley and me, well, we've paid taxes and bought the mule<br> and seeds and what-all and a few hogs and chickens. Miss Melly's<br> done mighty well with the hens, yes sir, she has. She's a fine<br> woman, Miss Melly is. Well, anyway, after we bought things for<br> Tara, there warn't so much left over for folderols, but none of us<br> warn't complainin'. Except Suellen.<br><br> ‘Miss Melanie and Miss Carreen stay at home and wear their old<br> clothes like they're proud of them but you know Suellen, Scarlett.<br> She hasn't never got used to doin' without. It used to stick in<br> her craw that she had to wear old dresses every time I took her<br> into Jonesboro or over to Fayetteville. 'Specially as some of<br> those Carpetbaggers' ladi--women was always flouncin' around in<br> fancy trimmin's. The wives of those damn Yankees that run the<br> Freedmen's Bureau, do they dress up! Well, it's kind of been a<br> point of honor with the ladies of the County to wear their worst-<br> lookin' dresses to town, just to show how they didn't care and was<br> proud to wear them. But not Suellen. And she wanted a horse and<br> carriage too. She pointed out that you had one.’<br><br> ‘It's not a carriage, it's an old buggy,’ said Scarlett indignantly.<br><br> ‘Well, no matter what. I might as well tell you Suellen never has<br> got over your marryin' Frank Kennedy and I don't know as I blame<br> her. You know that was a kind of scurvy trick to play on a<br> sister.’<br><br> Scarlett rose from his shoulder, furious as a rattler ready to<br> strike.<br><br> ‘Scurvy trick, hey? I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your<br> head, Will Benteen! Could I help it if he preferred me to her?’<br><br> ‘You're a smart girl, Scarlett, and I figger, yes, you could have<br> helped him preferrin' you. Girls always can. But I guess you kind<br> of coaxed him. You're a mighty takin' person when you want to be,<br> but all the same, he was Suellen's beau. Why, she'd had a letter<br> from him a week before you went to Atlanta and he was sweet as<br> sugar about her and talked about how they'd get married when he got<br> a little more money ahead. I know because she showed me the<br> letter.’<br><br> Scarlett was silent because she knew he was telling the truth and<br> she could think of nothing to say. She had never expected Will, of<br> all people, to sit in judgment on her. Moreover the lie she had<br> told Frank had never weighed heavily upon her conscience. If a<br> girl couldn't keep a beau, she deserved to lose him.<br><br> ‘Now, Will, don't be mean,’ she said. ‘If Suellen had married him,<br> do you think she'd ever have spent a penny on Tara or any of us?’<br><br> ‘I said you could be right takin' when you wanted to,’ said Will,<br> turning to her with a quiet grin. ‘No, I don't think we'd ever<br> seen a penny of old Frank's money. But still there's no gettin'<br> 'round it, it was a scurvy trick and if you want to justify the end<br> by the means, it's none of my business and who am I to complain?<br> But just the same Suellen has been like a hornet ever since. I<br> don't think she cared much about old Frank but it kind of teched<br> her vanity and she's been sayin' as how you had good clothes and a<br> carriage and lived in Atlanta while she was buried here at Tara.<br> She does love to go callin' and to parties, you know, and wear<br> pretty clothes. I ain't blamin' her. Women are like that.<br><br> ‘Well, about a month ago I took her into Jonesboro and left her to<br> go callin' while I tended to business and when I took her home, she<br> was still as a mouse but I could see she was so excited she was<br> ready to bust. I thought she'd found out somebody was goin' to<br> have a--that she'd heard some gossip that was interestin', and I<br> didn't pay her much mind. She went around home for about a week<br> all swelled up and excited and didn't have much to say. She went<br> over to see Miss Cathleen Calvert--Scarlett, you'd cry your eyes<br> out at Miss Cathleen. Pore girl, she'd better be dead than married<br> to that pusillanimous Yankee Hilton. You knew he'd mortgaged the<br> place and lost it and they're goin' to have to leave?’<br><br> ‘No, I didn't know and I don't want to know. I want to know about<br> Pa.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'm gettin' to that,’ said Will patiently. ‘When she come<br> back from over there she said we'd all misjudged Hilton. She<br> called him Mr. Hilton and she said he was a smart man, but we just<br> laughed at her. Then she took to takin' your pa out to walk in the<br> afternoons and lots of times when I was comin' home from the field<br> I'd see her sittin' with him on the wall 'round the buryin' ground,<br> talkin' at him hard and wavin' her hands. And the old gentleman<br> would just look at her sort of puzzled-like and shake his head.<br> You know how he's been, Scarlett. He just got kind of vaguer and<br> vaguer, like he didn't hardly know where he was or who we were.<br> One time, I seen her point to your ma's grave and the old gentleman<br> begun to cry. And when she come in the house all happy and excited<br> lookin', I gave her a talkin' to, right sharp, too, and I said:<br> 'Miss Suellen, why in hell are you devilin' your poor pa and<br> bringin' up your ma to him? Most of the time he don't realize<br> she's dead and here you are rubbin' it in.' And she just kind of<br> tossed her head and laughed and said: 'Mind your business. Some<br> day you'll be glad of what I'm doin'.' Miss Melanie told me last<br> night that Suellen had told her about her schemes but Miss Melly<br> said she didn't have no notion Suellen was serious. She said she<br> didn't tell none of us because she was so upset at the very idea.’<br><br> ‘What idea? Are you ever going to get to the point? We're halfway<br> home now. I want to know about Pa.’<br><br> ‘I'm trying to tell you,’ said Will, ‘and we're so near home, I<br> guess I'd better stop right here till I've finished.’<br><br> He drew rein and the horse stopped and snorted. They had halted by<br> the wild overgrown mock-orange hedge that marked the Macintosh<br> property. Glancing under the dark trees Scarlett could just<br> discern the tall ghostly chimneys still rearing above the silent<br> ruin. She wished that Will had chosen any other place to stop.<br><br> ‘Well, the long and the short of her idea was to make the Yankees<br> pay for the cotton they burned and the stock they drove off and the<br> fences and the barns they tore down.’<br><br> ‘The Yankees?’<br><br> ‘Haven't you heard about it? The Yankee government's been payin'<br> claims on all destroyed property of Union sympathizers in the<br> South.’<br><br> ‘Of course I've heard about that,’ said Scarlett. ‘But what's that<br> got to do with us?’<br><br> ‘A heap, in Suellen's opinion. That day I took her to Jonesboro,<br> she run into Mrs. MacIntosh and when they were gossipin' along,<br> Suellen couldn't help noticin' what fine-lookin' clothes Mrs.<br> Macintosh had on and she couldn't help askin' about them. Then<br> Mrs. MacIntosh gave herself a lot of airs and said as how her<br> husband had put in a claim with the Federal government for<br> destroyin' the property of a loyal Union sympathizer who had never<br> given aid and comfort to the Confederacy in any shape or form.’<br><br> ‘They never gave aid and comfort to anybody,’ snapped Scarlett.<br> ‘Scotch-Irish!’<br><br> ‘Well, maybe that's true. I don't know them. Anyway, the<br> government gave them, well--I forget how many thousand dollars. A<br> right smart sum it was, though. That started Suellen. She thought<br> about it all week and didn't say nothin' to us because she knew<br> we'd just laugh. But she just had to talk to somebody so she went<br> over to Miss Cathleen's and that damned white trash, Hilton, gave<br> her a passel of new ideas. He pointed out that your pa warn't even<br> born in this country, that he hadn't fought in the war and hadn't<br> had no sons to fight, and hadn't never held no office under the<br> Confederacy. He said they could strain a point about Mr. O'Hara<br> bein' a loyal Union sympathizer. He filled her up with such truck<br> and she come home and begun workin' on Mr. O'Hara. Scarlett, I bet<br> my life your pa didn't even know half the time what she was talkin'<br> about. That was what she was countin' on, that he would take the<br> Iron Clad oath and not even know it.’<br><br> ‘Pa take the Iron Clad oath!’ cried Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Well, he'd gotten right feeble in his mind these last months and I<br> guess she was countin' on that. Mind you, none of us suspicioned<br> nothin' about it. We knew she was cookin' up somethin', but we<br> didn't know she was usin' your dead ma to reproach him for his<br> daughters bein' in rags when he could get a hundred and fifty<br> thousand dollars out of the Yankees.’<br><br> ‘One hundred and fifty thousand dollars,’ murmured Scarlett, her<br> horror at the oath fading.<br><br> What a lot of money that was! And to be had for the mere signing<br> of an oath of allegiance to the United States government, an oath<br> stating that the signer had always supported the government and<br> never given aid and comfort to its enemies. One hundred and fifty<br> thousand dollars! That much money for that small a lie! Well, she<br> couldn't blame Suellen. Good heavens! Was that what Alex meant by<br> wanting to rawhide her? What the County meant by intending to cut<br> her? Fools, every one of them. What couldn't she do with that<br> much money! What couldn't any of the folks in the County do with<br> it! And what did so small a lie matter? After all, anything you<br> could get out of the Yankees was fair money, no matter how you got<br> it.<br><br> ‘Yesterday, about noon when Ashley and me were splittin' rails,<br> Suellen got this wagon and got your pa in it and off they went to<br> town without a word to anybody. Miss Melly had a notion what it<br> was all about but she was prayin' somethin' would change Suellen,<br> so she didn't say nothin' to the rest of us. She just didn't see<br> how Suellen could do such a thing.<br><br> ‘Today I heard all about what happened. That pusillanimous fellow,<br> Hilton, had some influence with the other Scallawags and<br> Republicans in town and Suellen had agreed to give them some of the<br> money--I don't know how much--if they'd kind of wink their eye<br> about Mr. O'Hara bein' a loyal Union man and play on how he was an<br> Irishman and didn't fight in the army and so on, and sign<br> recommendations. All your pa had to do was take the oath and sign<br> the paper and off it would go to Washington.<br><br> ‘They rattled off the oath real fast and he didn't say nothin' and<br> it went right well till she got him up to the signin' of it. And<br> then the old gentleman kind of come to himself for a minute and<br> shook his head. I don't think he knew what it was all about but he<br> didn't like it and Suellen always did rub him the wrong way. Well,<br> that just about gave her the nervous fits after all the trouble<br> she'd gone to. She took him out of the office and rode him up and<br> down the road and talked to him about your ma cryin' out of her<br> grave at him for lettin' her children suffer when he could provide<br> for them. They tell me your pa sat there in the wagon and cried<br> like a baby, like he always does when he hears her name. Everybody<br> in town saw them and Alex Fontaine went over to see what was the<br> matter, but Suellen gave him the rough side of her tongue and told<br> him to mind his own business, so he went off mad.<br><br> ‘I don't know where she got the notion but some time in the<br> afternoon she got a bottle of brandy and took Mr. O'Hara back to<br> the office and begun pourin' it for him. Scarlett, we haven't had<br> no spirits 'round Tara for a year, just a little blackberry wine<br> and scuppernong wine Dilcey makes, and Mr. O'Hara warn't used to<br> it. He got real drunk, and after Suellen had argued and nagged a<br> couple of hours he gave in and said Yes, he'd sign anything she<br> wanted. They got the oath out again and just as he was about to<br> put pen to paper, Suellen made her mistake. She said: 'Well, now.<br> I guess the Slatterys and the MacIntoshes won't be givin'<br> themselves airs over us!' You see, Scarlett, the Slatterys had put<br> in a claim for a big amount for that little shack of theirs that<br> the Yankees burned and Emmie's husband had got it through<br> Washington for them.<br><br> ‘They tell me that when Suellen said those names, your pa kind of<br> straightened up and squared his shoulders and looked at her, sharp-<br> like. He warn't vague no more and he said: 'Have the Slatterys<br> and the MacIntoshes signed somethin' like this?' and Suellen got<br> nervous and said Yes and No and stuttered and he shouted right<br> loud: 'Tell me, did that God-damned Orangeman and that God-damned<br> poor white sign somethin' like this?' And that feller Hilton spoke<br> up smooth-like and said: 'Yes sir, they did and they got a pile of<br> money like you'll get.'<br><br> ‘And then the old gentleman let out a roar like a bull. Alex<br> Fontaine said he heard him from down the street at the saloon. And<br> he said with a brogue you could cut with a butterknife: 'And were<br> ye afther thinkin' an O'Hara of Tara would be follyin' the dirthy<br> thracks of a Goddamned Orangeman and a God-damned poor white?' And<br> he tore the paper in two and threw it in Suellen's face and he<br> bellowed: 'Ye're no daughter of mine!' and he was out of the<br> office before you could say Jack Robinson.<br><br> ‘Alex said he saw him come out on the street, chargin' like a bull.<br> He said the old gentleman looked like his old self for the first<br> time since your ma died. Said he was reelin' drunk and cussin' at<br> the top of his lungs. Alex said he never heard such fine cussin'.<br> Alex's horse was standin' there and your pa climbed on it without a<br> by-your-leave and off he went in a cloud of dust so thick it choked<br> you, cussin' every breath he drew.<br><br> ‘Well, about sundown Ashley and me were sittin' on the front step,<br> lookin' down the road and mighty worried. Miss Melly was upstairs<br> cryin' on her bed and wouldn't tell us nothin'. Terrectly, we<br> heard a poundin' down the road and somebody yellin' like they was<br> fox huntin' and Ashley said: 'That's queer! That sounds like Mr.<br> O'Hara when he used to ride over to see us before the war.’<br><br> ‘And then we seen him way down at the end of the pasture. He must<br> have jumped the fence right over there. And he come ridin' hell-<br> for-leather up the hill, singin' at the top of his voice like he<br> didn't have a care in the world. I didn't know your pa had such a<br> voice. He was singin' 'Peg in a Low-backed Car' and beatin' the<br> horse with his hat and the horse was goin' like mad. He didn't<br> draw rein when he come near the top and we seen he was goin' to<br> jump the pasture fence and we hopped up, scared to death, and then<br> he yelled: 'Look, Ellen! Watch me take this one!' But the horse<br> stopped right on his haunches at the fence and wouldn't take the<br> jump and your pa went right over his head. He didn't suffer none.<br> He was dead time we got to him. I guess it broke his neck.’<br><br> Will waited a minute for her to speak and when she did not he<br> picked up the reins. ‘Giddap, Sherman,’ he said, and the horse<br> started on toward home.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XL<br><br> <br> Scarlett slept little that night. When the dawn had come and the<br> sun was creeping over the black pines on the hills to the east, she<br> rose from her tumbled bed and, seating herself on a stool by the<br> window, laid her tired head on her arm and looked out over the barn<br> yard and orchard of Tara toward the cotton fields. Everything was<br> fresh and dewy and silent and green and the sight of the cotton<br> fields brought a measure of balm and comfort to her sore heart.<br> Tara, at sunrise, looked loved, well tended and at peace, for all<br> that its master lay dead. The squatty log chicken house was clay<br> daubed against rats, weasels and clean with whitewash, and so was<br> the log stable. The garden with its rows of corn, bright-yellow<br> squash, butter beans and turnips was well weeded and neatly fenced<br> with split-oak rails. The orchard was cleared of underbrush and<br> only daisies grew beneath the long rows of trees. The sun picked<br> out with faint glistening the apples and the furred pink peaches<br> half hidden in the green leaves. Beyond lay the curving rows of<br> cotton, still and green under the gold of the new sky. The ducks<br> and chickens were waddling and strutting off toward the fields, for<br> under the bushes in the soft plowed earth were found the choicest<br> worms and slugs.<br><br> Scarlett's heart swelled with affection and gratitude to Will who<br> had done all of this. Even her loyalty to Ashley could not make<br> her believe he had been responsible for much of this well-being,<br> for Tara's bloom was not the work of a planter-aristocrat, but of<br> the plodding, tireless ‘small farmer’ who loved his land. It was<br> a ‘two-horse’ farm, not the lordly plantation of other days with<br> pastures full of mules and fine horses and cotton and corn<br> stretching as far as eye could see. But what there was of it was<br> good and the acres that were lying fallow could be reclaimed when<br> times grew better, and they would be the more fertile for their<br> rest.<br><br> Will had done more than merely farm a few acres. He had kept<br> sternly at bay those two enemies of Georgia planters, the seedling<br> pine and the blackberry brambles. They had not stealthily taken<br> garden and pasture and cotton field and lawn and reared themselves<br> insolently by the porches of Tara, as they were doing on numberless<br> plantations throughout the state.<br><br> Scarlett's heart failed a beat when she thought how close Tara had<br> come to going back to wilderness. Between herself and Will, they<br> had done a good job. They had held off the Yankees, the<br> Carpetbaggers and the encroachments of Nature. And, best of all,<br> Will had told her that after the cotton came in in the fall, she<br> need send no more money--unless some other Carpetbagger coveted<br> Tara and skyrocketed the taxes. Scarlett knew Will would have a<br> hard pull without her help but she admired and respected his<br> independence. As long as he was in the position of hired help he<br> would take her money, but now that he was to become her brother-in-<br> law and the man of the house, he intended to stand on his own<br> efforts. Yes, Will was something the Lord had provided.<br><br> <br><br> Pork had dug the grave the night before, close by Ellen's grave,<br> and he stood, spade in hand, behind the moist red clay he was soon<br> to shovel back in place. Scarlett stood behind him in the patchy<br> shade of a gnarled low-limbed cedar, the hot sun of the June<br> morning dappling her, and tried to keep her eyes away from the red<br> trench in front of her. Jim Tarleton, little Hugh Munroe, Alex<br> Fontaine and old man McRae's youngest grandson came slowly and<br> awkwardly down the path from the house bearing Gerald's coffin on<br> two lengths of split oak. Behind them, at a respectful distance,<br> followed a large straggling crowd of neighbors and friends,<br> shabbily dressed, silent. As they came down the sunny path through<br> the garden, Pork bowed his head upon the top of the spade handle<br> and cried; and Scarlett saw with incurious surprise that the kinks<br> on his head, so jettily black when she went to Atlanta a few months<br> before, were now grizzled.<br><br> She thanked God tiredly that she had cried all her tears the night<br> before, so now she could stand erect and dry eyed. The sound of<br> Suellen's tears, just back of her shoulder, irritated her<br> unbearably and she had to clench her fists to keep from turning and<br> slapping the swollen face. Sue had been the cause of her father's<br> death, whether she intended it or not, and she should have the<br> decency to control herself in front of the hostile neighbors. Not<br> a single person had spoken to her that morning or given her one<br> look of sympathy. They had kissed Scarlett quietly, shaken her<br> hand, murmured kind words to Carreen and even to Pork but had<br> looked through Suellen as if she were not there.<br><br> To them she had done worse than murder her father. She had tried<br> to betray him into disloyalty to the South. And to that grim and<br> close-knit community it was as if she had tried to betray the honor<br> of them all. She had broken the solid front the County presented<br> to the world. By her attempt to get money from the Yankee<br> government she had aligned herself with Carpetbaggers and<br> Scallawags, more hated enemies than the Yankee soldiers had ever<br> been. She, a member of an old and staunchly Confederate family, a<br> planter's family, had gone over to the enemy and by so doing had<br> brought shame on every family in the County.<br><br> The mourners were seething with indignation and downcast with<br> sorrow, especially three of them--old man McRae, who had been<br> Gerald's crony since he came to the up-country from Savannah so<br> many years before, Grandma Fontaine who loved him because he was<br> Ellen's husband, and Mrs. Tarleton who had been closer to him than<br> to any of her neighbors because, as she often said, he was the only<br> man in the County who knew a stallion from a gelding.<br><br> The sight of the stormy faces of these three in the dim parlor<br> where Gerald lay before the funeral had caused Ashley and Will some<br> uneasiness and they had retired to Ellen's office for a consultation.<br><br> ‘Some of them are goin' to say somethin' about Suellen,’ said Will<br> abruptly, biting his straw in half. ‘They think they got just<br> cause to say somethin'. Maybe they have. It ain't for me to say.<br> But, Ashley, whether they're right or not, we'll have to resent it,<br> bein' the men of the family, and then there'll be trouble. Can't<br> nobody do nothin' with old man McRae because he's deaf as a post<br> and can't hear folks tryin' to shut him up. And you know there<br> ain't nobody in God's world ever stopped Grandma Fontaine from<br> speakin' her mind. And as for Mrs. Tarleton--did you see her roll<br> them russet eyes of hers every time she looked at Sue? She's got<br> her ears laid back and can't hardly wait. If they say somethin',<br> we got to take it up and we got enough trouble at Tara now without<br> bein' at outs with our neighbors.’<br><br> Ashley sighed worriedly. He knew the tempers of his neighbors<br> better than Will did and he remembered that fully half of the<br> quarrels and some of the shootings of the days before the war had<br> risen from the County custom of saying a few words over the coffins<br> of departed neighbors. Generally the words were eulogistic in the<br> extreme but occasionally they were not. Sometimes, words meant in<br> the utmost respect were misconstrued by overstrung relatives of the<br> dead and scarcely were the last shovels of earth mounded above the<br> coffin before trouble began.<br><br> In the absence of a priest Ashley was to conduct the services with<br> the aid of Carreen's Book of Devotions, the assistance of the<br> Methodist and Baptist preachers of Jonesboro and Fayetteville<br> having been tactfully refused. Carreen, more devoutly Catholic<br> than her sisters, had been very upset that Scarlett had neglected<br> to bring a priest from Atlanta with her and had only been a little<br> eased by the reminder that when the priest came down to marry Will<br> and Suellen, he could read the services over Gerald. It was she<br> who objected to the neighboring Protestant preachers and gave the<br> matter into Ashley's hands, marking passages in her book for him to<br> read. Ashley, leaning against the old secretary, knew that the<br> responsibility for preventing trouble lay with him and, knowing the<br> hair-trigger tempers of the County, was at a loss as to how to<br> proceed.<br><br> ‘There's no help for it, Will,’ he said, rumpling his bright hair.<br> ‘I can't knock Grandma Fontaine down or old man McRae either, and I<br> can't hold my hand over Mrs. Tarleton's mouth. And the mildest<br> thing they'll say is that Suellen is a murderess and a traitor and<br> but for her Mr. O'Hara would still be alive. Damn this custom of<br> speaking over the dead. It's barbarous.’<br><br> ‘Look, Ash,’ said Will slowly. ‘I ain't aimin' to have nobody say<br> nothin' against Suellen, no matter what they think. You leave it<br> to me. When you've finished with the readin' and the prayin' and<br> you say: 'If anyone would like to say a few words,' you look right<br> at me, so I can speak first.’<br><br> But Scarlett, watching the pallbearers' difficulty in getting the<br> coffin through the narrow entrance into the burying ground, had no<br> thought of trouble to come after the funeral. She was thinking<br> with a leaden heart that in burying Gerald she was burying one of<br> the last links that joined her to the old days of happiness and<br> irresponsibility.<br><br> Finally the pallbearers set the coffin down near the grave and<br> stood clenching and unclenching their aching fingers. Ashley,<br> Melanie and Will filed into the inclosure and stood behind the<br> O'Hara girls. All the closer neighbors who could crowd in were<br> behind them and the others stood outside the brick wall. Scarlett,<br> really seeing them for the first time, was surprised and touched by<br> the size of the crowd. With transportation so limited it was kind<br> of so many to come. There were fifty or sixty people there, some<br> of them from so far away she wondered how they had heard in time to<br> come. There were whole families from Jonesboro and Fayetteville<br> and Lovejoy and with them a few negro servants. Many small farmers<br> from far across the river were present and Crackers from the<br> backwoods and a scattering of swamp folk. The swamp men were lean<br> bearded giants in homespun, coon-skin caps on their heads, their<br> rifles easy in the crooks of their arms, their wads of tobacco<br> stilled in their cheeks. Their women were with them, their bare<br> feet sunk in the soft red earth, their lower lips full of snuff.<br> Their faces beneath their sun-bonnets were sallow and malarial-<br> looking but shining clean and their freshly ironed calicoes<br> glistened with starch.<br><br> The near neighbors were there in full force. Grandma Fontaine,<br> withered, wrinkled and yellow as an old molted bird, was leaning on<br> her cane, and behind her were Sally Munroe Fontaine and Young Miss<br> Fontaine. They were trying vainly by whispered pleas and jerks at<br> her skirt to make the old lady sit down on the brick wall.<br> Grandma's husband, the Old Doctor, was not there. He had died two<br> months before and much of the bright malicious joy of life had gone<br> from her old eyes. Cathleen Calvert Hilton stood alone as befitted<br> one whose husband had helped bring about the present tragedy, her<br> faded sunbonnet hiding her bowed face. Scarlett saw with amazement<br> that her percale dress had grease spots on it and her hands were<br> freckled and unclean. There were even black crescents under her<br> fingernails. There was nothing of quality folks about Cathleen<br> now. She looked Cracker, even worse. She looked poor white,<br> shiftless, slovenly, trifling.<br><br> ‘She'll be dipping snuff soon, if she isn't doing it already,’<br> thought Scarlett in horror. ‘Good Lord! What a comedown!’<br><br> She shuddered, turning her eyes from Cathleen as she realized how<br> narrow was the chasm between quality folk and poor whites.<br><br> ‘There but for a lot of gumption am I,’ she thought, and pride<br> surged through her as she realized that she and Cathleen had<br> started with the same equipment after the surrender--empty hands<br> and what they had in their heads.<br><br> ‘I haven't done so bad,’ she thought, lifting her chin and smiling.<br><br> But she stopped in mid-smile as she saw the scandalized eyes of<br> Mrs. Tarleton upon her. Her eyes were red-rimmed from tears and,<br> after giving Scarlett a reproving look, she turned her gaze back to<br> Suellen, a fierce angry gaze that boded ill for her. Behind her<br> and her husband were the four Tarleton girls, their red locks<br> indecorous notes in the solemn occasion, their russet eyes still<br> looking like the eyes of vital young animals, spirited and<br> dangerous.<br><br> Feet were stilled, hats were removed, hands folded and skirts<br> rustled into quietness as Ashley stepped forward with Carreen's<br> worn Book of Devotions in his hand. He stood for a moment looking<br> down, the sun glittering on his golden head. A deep silence fell<br> on the crowd, so deep that the harsh whisper of the wind in the<br> magnolia leaves came clear to their ears and the far-off<br> repetitious note of a mockingbird sounded unendurably loud and sad.<br> Ashley began to read the prayers and all heads bowed as his<br> resonant, beautifully modulated voice rolled out the brief and<br> dignified words.<br><br> ‘Oh!’ thought Scarlett, her throat constricting. ‘How beautiful<br> his voice is! If anyone has to do this for Pa, I'm glad it's<br> Ashley. I'd rather have him than a priest. I'd rather have Pa<br> buried by one of his own folks than a stranger.’<br><br> When Ashley came to the part of the prayers concerning the souls in<br> Purgatory, which Carreen had marked for him to read, he abruptly<br> closed the book. Only Carreen noticed the omission and looked up<br> puzzled, as he began the Lord's Prayer. Ashley knew that half the<br> people present had never heard of Purgatory and those who had would<br> take it as a personal affront, if he insinuated, even in prayer,<br> that so fine a man as Mr. O'Hara had not gone straight to Heaven.<br> So, in deference to public opinion, he skipped all mention of<br> Purgatory. The gathering joined heartily in the Lord's Prayer but<br> their voices trailed off into embarrassed silence when he began the<br> Hail Mary. They had never heard that prayer and they looked<br> furtively at each other as the O'Hara girls, Melanie and the Tara<br> servants gave the response: ‘Pray for us, now and at the hour of<br> our death. Amen.’<br><br> Then Ashley raised his head and stood for a moment, uncertain. The<br> eyes of the neighbors were expectantly upon him as they settled<br> themselves in easier positions for a long harangue. They were<br> waiting for him to go on with the service, for it did not occur to<br> any of them that he was at the end of the Catholic prayers. County<br> funerals were always long. The Baptist and Methodist ministers who<br> performed them had no set prayers but extemporized as the<br> circumstances demanded and seldom stopped before all mourners were<br> in tears and the bereaved feminine relatives screaming with grief.<br> The neighbors would have been shocked, aggrieved and indignant, had<br> these brief prayers been all the service over the body of their<br> loved friend, and no one knew this better than Ashley. The matter<br> would be discussed at dinner tables for weeks and the opinion of<br> the County would be that the O'Hara girls had not shown proper<br> respect for their father.<br><br> So he threw a quick apologetic glance at Carreen and, bowing his<br> head again, began reciting from memory the Episcopal burial service<br> which he had often read over slaves buried at Twelve Oaks.<br><br> ‘I am the Resurrection and the Life . . . and whosoever . . .<br> believeth in Me shall never die.’<br><br> It did not come back to him readily and he spoke slowly,<br> occasionally falling silent for a space as he waited for phrases to<br> rise from his memory. But this measured delivery made his words<br> more impressive, and mourners who had been dry-eyed before began<br> now to reach for handkerchiefs. Sturdy Baptists and Methodists<br> all, they thought it the Catholic ceremony and immediately<br> rearranged their first opinion that the Catholic services were cold<br> and Popish. Scarlett and Suellen were equally ignorant and thought<br> the words comforting and beautiful. Only Melanie and Carreen<br> realized that a devoutly Catholic Irishman was being laid to rest<br> by the Church of England's service. And Carreen was too stunned by<br> grief and her hurt at Ashley's treachery to interfere.<br><br> When he had finished, Ashley opened wide his sad gray eyes and<br> looked about the crowd. After a pause, his eyes caught those of<br> Will and he said: ‘Is there anyone present who would like to say a<br> word?’<br><br> Mrs. Tarleton twitched nervously but before she could act, Will<br> stumped forward and standing at the head of the coffin began to<br> speak.<br><br> ‘Friends,’ he began in his flat voice, ‘maybe you think I'm gettin'<br> above myself, speakin' first--me who never knew Mr. O'Hara till<br> 'bout a year ago when you all have known him twenty years or more.<br> But this here is my excuse. If he'd lived a month or so longer,<br> I'd have had the right to call him Pa.’<br><br> A startled ripple went over the crowd. They were too well bred to<br> whisper but they shifted on their feet and stared at Carreen's<br> bowed head. Everyone knew his dumb devotion to her. Seeing the<br> direction in which all eyes were cast, Will went on as if he had<br> taken no note.<br><br> ‘So bein' as how I'm to marry Miss Suellen as soon as the priest<br> comes down from Atlanta, I thought maybe that gives me the right to<br> speak first.’<br><br> The last part of his speech was lost in a faint sibilant buzz that<br> went through the gathering, an angry beelike buzz. There were<br> indignation and disappointment in the sound. Everyone liked Will,<br> everyone respected him for what he had done for Tara. Everyone<br> knew his affections lay with Carreen, so the news that he was to<br> marry the neighborhood pariah instead sat ill upon them. Good old<br> Will marrying that nasty, sneaking little Suellen O'Hara!<br><br> For a moment the air was tense. Mrs. Tarleton's eyes began to snap<br> and her lips to shape soundless words. In the silence, old man<br> McRae's high voice could be heard imploring his grandson to tell<br> him what had been said. Will faced them all, still mild of face,<br> but there was something in his pale blue eyes which dared them to<br> say one word about his future wife. For a moment the balance hung<br> between the honest affection everyone had for Will and their<br> contempt for Suellen. And Will won. He continued as if his pause<br> had been a natural one.<br><br> ‘I never knew Mr. O'Hara in his prime like you all done. All I<br> knew personally was a fine old gentleman who was a mite addled.<br> But I've heard tell from you all 'bout what he used to be like.<br> And I want to say this. He was a fightin' Irishman and a Southern<br> gentleman and as loyal a Confederate as ever lived. You can't get<br> no better combination than that. And we ain't likely to see many<br> more like him, because the times that bred men like him are as dead<br> as he is. He was born in a furrin country but the man we're<br> buryin' here today was more of a Georgian than any of us mournin'<br> him. He lived our life, he loved our land and, when you come right<br> down to it, he died for our Cause, same as the soldiers did. He<br> was one of us and he had our good points and our bad points and he<br> had our strength and he had our failin's. He had our good points<br> in that couldn't nothin' stop him when his mind was made up and he<br> warn't scared of nothin' that walked in shoe leather. There warn't<br> nothin' that come to him FROM THE OUTSIDE that could lick him.<br><br> ‘He warn't scared of the English government when they wanted to<br> hang him. He just lit out and left home. And when he come to this<br> country and was pore, that didn't scare him a mite neither. He<br> went to work and he made his money. And he warn't scared to tackle<br> this section when it was part wild and the Injuns had just been run<br> out of it. He made a big plantation out of a wilderness. And when<br> the war come on and his money begun to go, he warn't scared to be<br> pore again. And when the Yankees come through Tara and might of<br> burnt him out or killed him, he warn't fazed a bit and he warn't<br> licked neither. He just planted his front feet and stood his<br> ground. That's why I say he had our good points. There ain't<br> nothin' FROM THE OUTSIDE can lick any of us.<br><br> ‘But he had our failin's too, 'cause he could be licked from the<br> inside. I mean to say that what the whole world couldn't do, his<br> own heart could. When Mrs. O'Hara died, his heart died too and he<br> was licked. And what we seen walking 'round here warn't him.’<br><br> Will paused and his eyes went quietly around the circle of faces.<br> The crowd stood in the hot sun as if enchanted to the ground and<br> whatever wrath they had felt for Suellen was forgotten. Will's<br> eyes rested for a moment on Scarlett and they crinkled slightly at<br> the corners as if he were inwardly smiling comfort to her.<br> Scarlett, who had been fighting back rising tears, did feel<br> comforted. Will was talking common sense instead of a lot of<br> tootle about reunions in another and better world and submitting<br> her will to God's. And Scarlett had always found strength and<br> comfort in common sense.<br><br> ‘And I don't want none of you to think the less of him for breakin'<br> like he done. All you all and me, too, are like him. We got the<br> same weakness and failin'. There ain't nothin' that walks can lick<br> us, any more than it could lick him, not Yankees nor Carpetbaggers<br> nor hard times nor high taxes nor even downright starvation. But<br> that weakness that's in our hearts can lick us in the time it takes<br> to bat your eye. It ain't always losin' someone you love that does<br> it, like it done Mr. O'Hara. Everybody's mainspring is different.<br> And I want to say this--folks whose main-springs are busted are<br> better dead. There ain't no place for them in the world these<br> days, and they're happier bein' dead. . . . That's why I'm sayin'<br> you all ain't got no cause to grieve for Mr. O'Hara now. The time<br> to grieve was back when Sherman come through and he lost Mrs.<br> O'Hara. Now that his body's gone to join his heart, I don't see<br> that we got reason to mourn, unless we're pretty damned selfish,<br> and I'm sayin' it who loved him like he was my own pa. . . . There<br> won't be no more words said, if you folks don't mind. The family<br> is too cut up to listen and it wouldn't be no kindness to them.’<br><br> Will stopped and, turning to Mrs. Tarleton, he said in a lower<br> voice: ‘I wonder couldn't you take Scarlett in the house, Ma'm?<br> It ain't right for her to be standin' in the sun so long. And<br> Grandma Fontaine don't look any too peart neither, meanin' no<br> disrespect.’<br><br> Startled at the abrupt switching from the eulogy to herself,<br> Scarlett went red with embarrassment as all eyes turned toward her.<br> Why should Will advertise her already obvious pregnancy? She gave<br> him a shamed indignant look, but Will's placid gaze bore her down.<br><br> ‘Please,’ his look said. ‘I know what I'm doin'.’<br><br> Already he was the man of the house and, not wishing to make a<br> scene, Scarlett turned helplessly to Mrs. Tarleton. That lady,<br> suddenly diverted, as Will had intended, from thoughts of Suellen<br> to the always fascinating matter of breeding, be it animal or<br> human, took Scarlett's arm.<br><br> ‘Come in the house, honey.’<br><br> Her face took on a look of kind, absorbed interest and Scarlett<br> suffered herself to be led through the crowd that gave way and made<br> a narrow path for her. There was a sympathetic murmuring as she<br> passed and several hands went out to pat her comfortingly. When<br> she came abreast Grandma Fontaine, the old lady put out a skinny<br> claw and said: ‘Give me your arm, child,’ and added with a fierce<br> glance at Sally and Young Miss: ‘No, don't you come. I don't want<br> you.’<br><br> They passed slowly through the crowd which closed behind them and<br> went up the shady path toward the house, Mrs. Tarleton's eager<br> helping hand so strong under Scarlett's elbow that she was almost<br> lifted from the ground at each step.<br><br> ‘Now, why did Will do that?’ cried Scarlett heatedly, when they<br> were out of earshot. ‘He practically said: 'Look at her! She's<br> going to have a baby!'‘<br><br> ‘Well, sake's alive, you are, aren't you?’ said Mrs. Tarleton.<br> ‘Will did right. It was foolish of you to stand in the hot sun<br> when you might have fainted and had a miscarriage.’<br><br> ‘Will wasn't bothered about her miscarrying,’ said Grandma, a<br> little breathless as she labored across the front yard toward the<br> steps. There was a grim, knowing smile on her face. ‘Will's<br> smart. He didn't want either you or me, Beetrice, at the graveside.<br> He was scared of what we'd say and he knew this was the only way to<br> get rid of us. . . . And it was more than that. He didn't want<br> Scarlett to hear the clods dropping on the coffin. And he's right.<br> Just remember, Scarlett, as long as you don't hear that sound, folks<br> aren't actually dead to you. But once you hear it . . . Well, it's<br> the most dreadfully final sound in the world. . . . Help me up the<br> steps, child, and give me a hand, Beetrice. Scarlett don't any more<br> need your arm than she needs crutches and I'm not so peart, as Will<br> observed. . . . Will knew you were your father's pet and he didn't<br> want to make it worse for you than it already was. He figured it<br> wouldn't be so bad for your sisters. Suellen has her shame to<br> sustain her and Carreen her God. But you've got nothing to sustain<br> you, have you, child?’<br><br> ‘No,’ answered Scarlett, helping the old lady up the steps, faintly<br> surprised at the truth that sounded in the reedy old voice. ‘I've<br> never had anything to sustain me--except Mother.’<br><br> ‘But when you lost her, you found you could stand alone, didn't<br> you? Well, some folks can't. Your pa was one. Will's right.<br> Don't you grieve. He couldn't get along without Ellen and he's<br> happier where he is. Just like I'll be happier when I join the Old<br> Doctor.’<br><br> She spoke without any desire for sympathy and the two gave her<br> none. She spoke as briskly and naturally as if her husband were<br> alive and in Jonesboro and a short buggy ride would bring them<br> together. Grandma was too old and had seen too much to fear death.<br><br> ‘But--you can stand alone too,’ said Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Yes, but it's powerful uncomfortable at times.’<br><br> ‘Look here, Grandma,’ interrupted Mrs. Tarleton, ‘you ought not to<br> talk to Scarlett like that. She's upset enough already. What with<br> her trip down here and that tight dress and her grief and the heat,<br> she's got enough to make her miscarry without your adding to it,<br> talking grief and sorrow.’<br><br> ‘God's nightgown!’ cried Scarlett in irritation. ‘I'm not upset!<br> And I'm not one of those sickly miscarrying fools!’<br><br> ‘You never can tell,’ said Mrs. Tarleton omnisciently. ‘I lost my<br> first when I saw a bull gore one of our darkies and--you remember<br> my red mare, Nellie? Now, there was the healthiest-looking mare<br> you ever saw but she was nervous and high strung and if I didn't<br> watch her, she'd--’<br><br> ‘Beetrice, hush,’ said Grandma. ‘Scarlett wouldn't miscarry on a<br> bet. Let's us sit here in the hall where it's cool. There's a<br> nice draft through here. Now, you go fetch us a glass of<br> buttermilk, Beetrice, if there's any in the kitchen. Or look in<br> the pantry and see if there's any wine. I could do with a glass.<br> We'll sit here till the folks come up to say goodby.’<br><br> ‘Scarlett ought to be in bed,’ insisted Mrs. Tarleton, running her<br> eyes over her with the expert air of one who calculated a pregnancy<br> to the last minute of its length.<br><br> ‘Get going,’ said Grandma, giving her a prod with her cane, and<br> Mrs. Tarleton went toward the kitchen, throwing her hat carelessly<br> on the sideboard and running her hands through her damp red hair.<br><br> Scarlett lay back in her chair and unbuttoned the two top buttons<br> of her tight basque. It was cool and dim in the high-ceilinged<br> hall and the vagrant draft that went from back to front of the<br> house was refreshing after the heat of the sun. She looked across<br> the hall into the parlor where Gerald had lain and, wrenching her<br> thoughts from him, looked up at the portrait of Grandma Robillard<br> hanging above the fireplace. The bayonet-scarred portrait with its<br> high-piled hair, hall-exposed breasts and cool insolence had, as<br> always, a tonic effect upon her.<br><br> ‘I don't know which hit Beetrice Tarleton worse, losing her boys or<br> her horses,’ said Grandma Fontaine. ‘She never did pay much mind<br> to Jim or her girls, you know. She's one of those folks Will was<br> talking about. Her mainspring's busted. Sometimes I wonder if she<br> won't go the way your pa went. She wasn't ever happy unless horses<br> or humans were breeding right in her face and none of her girls are<br> married or got any prospects of catching husbands in this county,<br> so she's got nothing to occupy her mind. If she wasn't such lady<br> at heart, she'd be downright common. . . . Was Will telling the<br> truth about marrying Suellen?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said Scarlett, looking the old lady full in the eye.<br> Goodness, she could remember the time when she was scared to death<br> of Grandma Fontaine! Well, she'd grown up since then and she'd<br> just as soon as not tell her to go to the devil if she meddled in<br> affairs at Tara.<br><br> ‘He could do better,’ said Grandma candidly.<br><br> ‘Indeed?’ said Scarlett haughtily.<br><br> ‘Come off your high horse, Miss,’ said the old lady tartly. ‘I<br> shan't attack your precious sister, though I might have if I'd<br> stayed at the burying ground. What I mean is with the scarcity of<br> men in the neighborhood, Will could marry most any of the girls.<br> There's Beetrice's four wild cats and the Munroe girls and the<br> McRae--’<br><br> ‘He's going to marry Sue and that's that.’<br><br> ‘She's lucky to get him.’<br><br> ‘Tara is lucky to get him.’<br><br> ‘You love this place, don't you?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘So much that you don't mind your sister marrying out of her class<br> as long as you have a man around to care for Tara?’<br><br> ‘Class?’ said Scarlett, startled at the idea. ‘Class? What does<br> class matter now, so long as a girl gets a husband who can take<br> care of her?’<br><br> ‘That's a debatable question,’ said Old Miss. ‘Some folks would<br> say you were talking common sense. Others would say you were<br> letting down bars that ought never be lowered one inch. Will's<br> certainly not quality folks and some of your people were.’<br><br> Her sharp old eyes went to the portrait of Grandma Robillard.<br><br> Scarlett thought of Will, lank, unimpressive, mild, eternally<br> chewing a straw, his whole appearance deceptively devoid of energy,<br> like that of most Crackers. He did not have behind him a long line<br> of ancestors of wealth, prominence and blood. The first of Will's<br> family to set foot on Georgia soil might even have been one of<br> Oglethorpe's debtors or a bond servant. Will had not been to<br> college. In fact, four years in a backwoods school was all the<br> education he had ever had. He was honest and he was loyal, he was<br> patient and he was hard working, but certainly he was not quality.<br> Undoubtedly by Robillard standards, Suellen was coming down in the<br> world.<br><br> ‘So you approve of Will coming into your family?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ answered Scarlett fiercely, ready to pounce upon the old<br> lady at the first words of condemnation.<br><br> ‘You may kiss me,’ said Grandma surprisingly, and she smiled in her<br> most approving manner. ‘I never liked you much till now, Scarlett.<br> You were always hard as a hickory nut, even as a child, and I don't<br> like hard females, barring myself. But I do like the way you meet<br> things. You don't make a fuss about things that can't be helped,<br> even if they are disagreeable. You take your fences cleanly like a<br> good hunter.’<br><br> Scarlett smiled uncertainly and pecked obediently at the withered<br> cheek presented to her. It was pleasant to hear approving words<br> again, even if she had little idea what they meant.<br><br> ‘There's plenty of folks hereabouts who'll have something to say<br> about you letting Sue marry a Cracker--for all that everybody likes<br> Will. They'll say in one breath what a fine man he is and how<br> terrible it is for an O'Hara girl to marry beneath her. But don't<br> you let it bother you.’<br><br> ‘I've never bothered about what people said.’<br><br> ‘So I've heard.’ There was a hint of acid in the old voice.<br> ‘Well, don't bother about what folks say. It'll probably be a very<br> successful marriage. Of course, Will's always going to look like a<br> Cracker and marriage won't improve his grammar any. And, even if<br> he makes a mint of money, he'll never lend any shine and sparkle to<br> Tara, like your father did. Crackers are short on sparkle. But<br> Will's a gentleman at heart. He's got the right instincts. Nobody<br> but a born gentleman could have put his finger on what is wrong<br> with us as accurately as he just did, down there at the burying.<br> The whole world can't lick us but we can lick ourselves by longing<br> too hard for things we haven't got any more--and by remembering too<br> much. Yes, Will will do well by Suellen and by Tara.’<br><br> ‘Then you approve of me letting him marry her?’<br><br> ‘God, no!’ The old voice was tired and bitter but vigorous.<br> ‘Approve of Crackers marrying into old families? Bah! Would I<br> approve of breeding scrub stock to thoroughbreds? Oh, Crackers are<br> good and solid and honest but--’<br><br> ‘But you said you thought it would be a successful match!’ cried<br> Scarlett bewildered.<br><br> ‘Oh, I think it's good for Suellen to marry Will--to marry anybody<br> for that matter, because she needs a husband bad. And where else<br> could she get one? And where else could you get as good a manager<br> for Tara? But that doesn't mean I like the situation any better<br> than you do.’<br><br> But I do like it, thought Scarlett trying to grasp the old lady's<br> meaning. I'm glad Will is going to marry her. Why should she<br> think I minded? She's taking it for granted that I do mind, just<br> like her.<br><br> She felt puzzled and a little ashamed, as always when people<br> attributed to her emotions and motives they possessed and thought<br> she shared.<br><br> Grandma fanned herself with her palmetto leaf and went on briskly:<br> ‘I don't approve of the match any more than you do but I'm<br> practical and so are you. And when it comes to something that's<br> unpleasant but can't be helped, I don't see any sense in screaming<br> and kicking about it. That's no way to meet the ups and downs of<br> life. I know because my family and the Old Doctor's family have<br> had more than our share of ups and downs. And if we folks have a<br> motto, it's this: 'Don't holler--smile and bide your time.' We've<br> survived a passel of things that way, smiling and biding our time,<br> and we've gotten to be experts at surviving. We had to be. We've<br> always bet on the wrong horses. Run out of France with the<br> Huguenots, run out of England with the Cavaliers, run out of<br> Scotland with Bonnie Prince Charlie, run out of Haiti by the<br> niggers and now licked by the Yankees. But we always turn up on<br> top in a few years. You know why?’<br><br> She cocked her head and Scarlett thought she looked like nothing so<br> much as an old, knowing parrot.<br><br> ‘No, I don't know, I'm sure,’ she answered politely. But she was<br> heartily bored, even as she had been the day when Grandma launched<br> on her memories of the Creek uprising.<br><br> ‘Well, this is the reason. We bow to the inevitable. We're not<br> wheat, we're buckwheat! When a storm comes along it flattens ripe<br> wheat because it's dry and can't bend with the wind. But ripe<br> buckwheat's got sap in it and it bends. And when the wind has<br> passed, it springs up almost as straight and strong as before. We<br> aren't a stiff-necked tribe. We're mighty limber when a hard<br> wind's blowing, because we know it pays to be limber. When trouble<br> comes we bow to the inevitable without any mouthing, and we work<br> and we smile and we bide our time. And we play along with lesser<br> folks and we take what we can get from them. And when we're strong<br> enough, we kick the folks whose necks we've climbed over. That, my<br> child, is the secret of the survival.’ And after a pause, she<br> added: ‘I pass it on to you.’<br><br> The old lady cackled, as if she were amused by her words, despite<br> the venom in them. She looked as if she expected some comment from<br> Scarlett but the words had made little sense to her and she could<br> think of nothing to say.<br><br> ‘No, sir,’ Old Miss went on, ‘our folks get flattened out but they<br> rise up again, and that's more than I can say for plenty of people<br> not so far away from here. Look at Cathleen Calvert. You can see<br> what she's come to. Poor white! And a heap lower than the man she<br> married. Look at the McRae family. Flat to the ground, helpless,<br> don't know what to do, don't know how to do anything. Won't even<br> try. They spend their time whining about the good old days. And<br> look at--well, look at nearly anybody in this County except my Alex<br> and my Sally and you and Jim Tarleton and his girls and some<br> others. The rest have gone under because they didn't have any sap<br> in them, because they didn't have the gumption to rise up again.<br> There never was anything to those folks but money and darkies, and<br> now that the money and darkies are gone, those folks will be<br> Cracker in another generation.’<br><br> ‘You forgot the Wilkes.’<br><br> ‘No, I didn't forget them. I just thought I'd be polite and not<br> mention them, seeing that Ashley's a guest under this roof. But<br> seeing as how you've brought up their names--look at them! There's<br> India who from all I hear is a dried-up old maid already, giving<br> herself all kinds of widowed airs because Stu Tarleton was killed<br> and not making any effort to forget him and try to catch another<br> man. Of course, she's old but she could catch some widower with a<br> big family if she tried. And poor Honey was always a man-crazy<br> fool with no more sense than a guinea hen. And as for Ashley, look<br> at him!’<br><br> ‘Ashley is a very fine man,’ began Scarlett hotly.<br><br> ‘I never said he wasn't but he's as helpless as a turtle on his<br> back. If the Wilkes family pulls through these hard times, it'll<br> be Melly who pulls them through. Not Ashley.’<br><br> ‘Melly! Lord, Grandma! What are you talking about? I've lived<br> with Melly long enough to know she's sickly and scared and hasn't<br> the gumption to say Boo to a goose.’<br><br> ‘Now why on earth should anyone want to say Boo to a goose? It<br> always sounded like a waste of time to me. She might not say Boo<br> to a goose but she'd say Boo to the world or the Yankee government<br> or anything else that threatened her precious Ashley or her boy or<br> her notions of gentility. Her way isn't your way, Scarlett, or my<br> way. It's the way your mother would have acted if she'd lived.<br> Melly puts me in mind of your mother when she was young. . . . And<br> maybe she'll pull the Wilkes family through.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Melly's a well-meaning little ninny. But you are very unjust<br> to Ashley. He's--’<br><br> ‘Oh, foot! Ashley was bred to read books and nothing else. That<br> doesn't help a man pull himself out of a tough fix, like we're all<br> in now. From what I hear, he's the worst plow hand in the County!<br> Now you just compare him with my Alex! Before the war, Alex was<br> the most worthless dandy in the world and he never had a thought<br> beyond a new cravat and getting drunk and shooting somebody and<br> chasing girls who were no better than they should be. But look at<br> him now! He learned farming because he had to learn. He'd have<br> starved and so would all of us. Now he raises the best cotton in<br> the County--yes, Miss! It's a heap better than Tara cotton!--and<br> he knows what to do with hogs and chickens. Ha! He's a fine boy<br> for all his bad temper. He knows how to bide his time and change<br> with changing ways and when all this Reconstruction misery is over,<br> you're going to see my Alex as rich a man as his father and his<br> grandfather were. But Ashley--’<br><br> Scarlett was smarting at the slight to Ashley.<br><br> ‘It all sounds like tootle to me,’ she said coldly.<br><br> ‘Well, it shouldn't,’ said Grandma, fastening a sharp eye upon her.<br> ‘For it's just exactly the course you've been following since you<br> went to Atlanta. Oh, yes! We hear of your didoes, even if we are<br> buried down here in the country. You've changed with the changing<br> times too. We hear how you suck up to the Yankees and the white<br> trash and the new-rich Carpetbaggers to get money out of them.<br> Butter doesn't melt in your mouth from all I can hear. Well, go to<br> it, I say. And get every cent out of them you can, but when you've<br> got enough money, kick them in the face, because they can't serve<br> you any longer. Be sure you do that and do it properly, for trash<br> hanging onto your coat tails can ruin you.’<br><br> Scarlett looked at her, her brow wrinkling with the effort to<br> digest the words. They still didn't make much sense and she was<br> still angry at Ashley being called a turtle on his back.<br><br> ‘I think you're wrong about Ashley,’ she said abruptly.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, you just aren't smart.’<br><br> ‘That's your opinion,’ said Scarlett rudely, wishing it were<br> permissible to smack old ladies' jaws.<br><br> ‘Oh, you're smart enough about dollars and cents. That's a man's<br> way of being smart. But you aren't smart at all like a woman. You<br> aren't a speck smart about folks.’<br><br> Scarlett's eyes began to snap fire and her hands to clench and<br> unclench.<br><br> ‘I've made you good and mad, haven't I?’ asked the old lady,<br> smiling. ‘Well, I aimed to do just that.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you did, did you? And why, pray?’<br><br> ‘I had good and plenty reasons.’<br><br> Grandma sank back in her chair and Scarlett suddenly realized that<br> she looked very tired and incredibly old. The tiny clawlike hands<br> folded over the fan were yellow and waxy as a dead person's. The<br> anger went out of Scarlett's heart as a thought came to her. She<br> leaned over and took one of the hands in hers.<br><br> ‘You're a mighty sweet old liar,’ she said. ‘You didn't mean a<br> word of all this rigmarole. You've just been talking to keep my<br> mind off Pa, haven't you?’<br><br> ‘Don't fiddle with me!’ said Old Miss grumpily, jerking away her<br> hand. ‘Partly for that reason, partly because what I've been<br> telling you is the truth and you're just too stupid to realize it.’<br><br> But she smiled a little and took the sting from her words.<br> Scarlett's heart emptied itself of wrath about Ashley. It was nice<br> to know Grandma hadn't meant any of it.<br><br> ‘Thank you, just the same. It was nice of you to talk to me--and<br> I'm glad to know you're with me about Will and Suellen, even if--<br> even if a lot of other people do disapprove.’<br><br> Mrs. Tarleton came down the hall, carrying two glasses of<br> buttermilk. She did all domestic things badly and the glasses were<br> slopping over.<br><br> ‘I had to go clear to the spring house to get it,’ she said.<br> ‘Drink it quick because the folks are coming up from the burying<br> ground. Scarlett, are you really going to let Suellen marry Will?<br> Not that he isn't a sight too good for her but you know he is a<br> Cracker and--’<br><br> Scarlett's eyes met those of Grandma. There was a wicked sparkle<br> in the old eyes that found an answer in her own.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLI<br><br> <br> When the last good-by had been said and the last sound of wheels<br> and hooves died away, Scarlett went into Ellen's office and removed<br> a gleaming object from where she had hidden it the night before<br> between the yellowed papers in the pigeon-holes of the secretary.<br> Hearing Pork sniffling in the dining room as he went about laying<br> the table for dinner she called to him. He came to her, his black<br> face as forlorn as a lost and masterless hound.<br><br> ‘Pork,’ she said sternly, ‘you cry just once more and I'll--I'll<br> cry, too. You've got to stop.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm. Ah try but eve'y time Ah try Ah thinks of Mist' Gerald<br> an'--’<br><br> ‘Well, don't think. I can stand everybody else's tears but not<br> yours. There,’ she broke off gently, ‘don't you see? I can't<br> stand yours because I know how you loved him. Blow your nose,<br> Pork. I've got a present for you.’<br><br> A little interest flickered in Pork's eyes as he blew his nose<br> loudly but it was more politeness than interest.<br><br> ‘You remember that night you got shot robbing somebody's hen<br> house?’<br><br> ‘Lawd Gawd, Miss Scarlett! Ah ain' never--’<br><br> ‘Well, you did, so don't lie to me about it at this late date. You<br> remember I said I was going to give you a watch for being so<br> faithful?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, Ah 'members. Ah figgered you'd done fergot.’<br><br> ‘No, I didn't forget and here it is.’<br><br> She held out for him a massive gold watch, heavily embossed, from<br> which dangled a chain with many fobs and seals.<br><br> ‘Fo' Gawd, Miss Scarlett!’ cried Pork. ‘Dat's Mist' Gerald's<br> watch! Ah done seen him look at dat watch a milyun times!’<br><br> ‘Yes, it's Pa's watch, Pork, and I'm giving it to you. Take it.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no'm!’ Pork retreated in horror. ‘Dat's a w'ite gempmum's<br> watch an' Mist' Gerald's ter boot. Huccome you talk 'bout givin'<br> it ter me, Miss Scnrlett? Dat watch belong by rights ter lil Wade<br> Hampton.’<br><br> ‘It belongs to you. What did Wade Hampton ever do for Pa? Did he<br> look after him when he was sick and feeble? Did he bathe him and<br> dress him and shave him? Did he stick by him when the Yankees<br> came? Did he steal for him? Don't be a fool, Pork. If ever<br> anyone deserved a watch, you do, and I know Pa would approve.<br> Here.’<br><br> She picked up the black hand and laid the watch in the palm. Pork<br> gazed at it reverently and slowly delight spread over his face.<br><br> ‘Fer me, truly, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘Yes, indeed.’<br><br> ‘Well'm--thankee, Ma'm.’<br><br> ‘Would you like for me to take it to Atlanta and have it engraved?’<br><br> ‘Whut's dis engrabed mean?’ Pork's voice was suspicious.<br><br> ‘It means to put writing on the back of it, like--like 'To Pork<br> from the O'Haras--Well done good and faithful servant.'‘<br><br> ‘No'm--thankee. Ma'm. Never mind de engrabin'.’ Pork retreated a<br> step, clutching the watch firmly.<br><br> A little smile twitched her lips.<br><br> ‘What's the matter, Pork? Don't you trust me to bring it back?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, Ah trus'es you--only, well'm, you mout change yo' mind.’<br><br> ‘I wouldn't do that.’<br><br> ‘Well'm, you mout sell it. Ah spec it's wuth a heap.’<br><br> ‘Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm--ef you needed de money.’<br><br> ‘You ought to be beat for that, Pork. I've a mind to take the<br> watch back.’<br><br> ‘No'm, you ain'!’ The first faint smile of the day showed on<br> Pork's grief-worn face. ‘Ah knows you--An' Miss Scarlett--’<br><br> ‘Yes, Pork?’<br><br> ‘Ef you wuz jes' half as nice ter w'ite folks as you is ter<br> niggers, Ah spec de worl' would treat you better.’<br><br> ‘It treats me well enough,’ she said. ‘Now, go find Mr. Ashley and<br> tell him I want to see him here, right away.’<br><br> Ashley sat on Ellen's little writing chair, his long body dwarfing<br> the frail bit of furniture while Scarlett offered him a half-<br> interest in the mill. Not once did his eyes meet hers and he spoke<br> no word of interruption. He sat looking down at his hands, turning<br> them over slowly, inspecting first palms and then backs, as though<br> he had never seen them before. Despite hard work, they were still<br> slender and sensitive looking and remarkably well tended for a<br> farmer's hands.<br><br> His bowed head and silence disturbed her a little and she redoubled<br> her efforts to make the mill sound attractive. She brought to<br> bear, too, all the charm of smile and glance she possessed but they<br> were wasted, for he did not raise his eyes. If he would only look<br> at her! She made no mention of the information Will had given her<br> of Ashley's determination to go North and spoke with the outward<br> assumption that no obstacle stood in the way of his agreement with<br> her plan. Still he did not speak and finally, her words trailed<br> into silence. There was a determined squareness about his slender<br> shoulders that alarmed her. Surely he wouldn't refuse! What<br> earthly reason could he have for refusing?<br><br> ‘Ashley,’ she began again and paused. She had not intended using<br> her pregnancy as an argument, had shrunk from the thought of Ashley<br> even seeing her so bloated and ugly, but as her other persuasions<br> seemed to have made no impression, she decided to use it and her<br> helplessness as a last card.<br><br> ‘You must come to Atlanta. I do need your help so badly now,<br> because I can't look after the mills. It may be months before I<br> can because--you see--well, because . . .’<br><br> ‘Please!’ he said roughly. ‘Good God, Scarlett!’<br><br> He rose and went abruptly to the window and stood with his back to<br> her, watching the solemn single file of ducks parade across the<br> barnyard.<br><br> ‘Is that--is that why you won't look at me?’ she questioned<br> forlornly. ‘I know I look--’<br><br> He swung around in a flash and his gray eyes met hers with an<br> intensity that made her hands go to her throat.<br><br> ‘Damn your looks!’ he said with a swift violence. ‘You know you<br> always look beautiful to me.’<br><br> Happiness flooded her until her eyes were liquid with tears.<br><br> ‘How sweet of you to say that! For I was so ashamed to let you see<br> me--’<br><br> ‘You ashamed? Why should you be ashamed? I'm the one to feel<br> shame and I do. If it hadn't been for my stupidity you wouldn't be<br> in this fix. You'd never have married Frank. I should never have<br> let you leave Tara last winter. Oh, fool that I was! I should<br> have known you--known you were desperate, so desperate that you'd--<br> I should have--I should have--’ His face went haggard.<br><br> Scarlett's heart beat wildly. He was regretting that he had not<br> run away with her!<br><br> ‘The least I could have done was go out and commit highway robbery<br> or murder to get the tax money for you when you had taken us in as<br> beggars. Oh, I messed it up all the way around!’<br><br> Her heart contracted with disappointment and some of the happiness<br> went from her, for these were not the words she hoped to hear.<br><br> ‘I would have gone anyway,’ she said tiredly. ‘I couldn't have let<br> you do anything like that. And anyway, it's done now.’<br><br> ‘Yes, it's done now,’ he said with slow bitterness. ‘You wouldn't<br> have let me do anything dishonorable but you would sell yourself to<br> a man you didn't love--and bear his child, so that my family and I<br> wouldn't starve. It was kind of you to shelter my helplessness.’<br><br> The edge in his voice spoke of a raw, unhealed wound that ached<br> within him and his words brought shame to her eyes. He was swift<br> to see it and his face changed to gentleness.<br><br> ‘You didn't think I was blaming you? Dear God, Scarlett! No. You<br> are the bravest woman I've ever known. It's myself I'm blaming.’<br><br> He turned and looked out of the window again and the shoulders<br> presented to her gaze did not look quite so square. Scarlett<br> waited a long moment in silence, hoping that Ashley would return to<br> the mood in which he spoke of her beauty, hoping he would say more<br> words that she could treasure. It had been so long since she had<br> seen him and she had lived on memories until they were worn thin.<br> She knew he still loved her. That fact was evident, in every line<br> of him, in every bitter, self-condemnatory word, in his resentment<br> at her bearing Frank's child. She so longed to hear him say it in<br> words, longed to speak words herself that would provoke a<br> confession, but she dared not. She remembered her promise given<br> last winter in the orchard, that she would never again throw<br> herself at his head. Sadly she knew that promise must be kept if<br> Ashley were to remain near her. One cry from her of love and<br> longing, one look that pleaded for his arms, and the matter would<br> be settled forever. Ashley would surely go to New York. And he<br> must not go away.<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, don't blame yourself! How could it be your fault?<br> You will come to Atlanta and help me, won't you?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘But, Ashley,’ her voice was beginning to break with anguish and<br> disappointment, ‘But I'd counted on you. I do need you so. Frank<br> can't help me. He's so busy with the store and if you don't come I<br> don't know where I can get a man! Everybody in Atlanta who is<br> smart is busy with his own affairs and the others are so<br> incompetent and--’<br><br> ‘It's no use, Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘You mean you'd rather go to New York and live among Yankees than<br> come to Atlanta?’<br><br> ‘Who told you that?’ He turned and faced her, faint annoyance<br> wrinkling his forehead.<br><br> ‘Will.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I've decided to go North. An old friend who made the Grand<br> Tour with me before the war has offered me a position in his<br> father's bank. It's better so, Scarlett. I'd be no good to you.<br> I know nothing of the lumber business.’<br><br> ‘But you know less about banking and it's much harder! And I know<br> I'd make far more allowances for your inexperience than Yankees<br> would!’<br><br> He winced and she knew she had said the wrong thing. He turned and<br> looked out of the window again.<br><br> ‘I don't want allowances made for me. I want to stand on my own<br> feet for what I'm worth. What have I done with my life, up till<br> now? It's time I made something of myself--or went down through my<br> own fault. I've been your pensioner too long already.’<br><br> ‘But I'm offering you a half-interest in the mill, Ashley! You<br> would be standing on your own feet because--you see, it would be<br> your own business.’<br><br> ‘It would amount to the same thing. I'd not be buying the half-<br> interest. I'd be taking it as a gift. And I've taken too many<br> gifts from you already, Scarlett--food and shelter and even clothes<br> for myself and Melanie and the baby. And I've given you nothing in<br> return.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but you have! Will couldn't have--’<br><br> ‘I can split kindling very nicely now.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley!’ she cried despairingly, tears in her eyes at the<br> jeering note in his voice. ‘What has happened to you since I've<br> been gone? You sound so hard and bitter! You didn't used to be<br> this way.’<br><br> ‘What's happened? A very remarkable thing, Scarlett. I've been<br> thinking. I don't believe I really thought from the time of the<br> surrender until you went away from here. I was in a state of<br> suspended animation and it was enough that I had something to eat<br> and a bed to lie on. But when you went to Atlanta, shouldering a<br> man's burden, I saw myself as much less than a man--much less,<br> indeed, than a woman. Such thoughts aren't pleasant to live with<br> and I do not intend to live with them any longer. Other men came<br> out of the war with less than I had, and look at them now. So I'm<br> going to New York.’<br><br> ‘But--I don't understand! If it's work you want, why won't Atlanta<br> do as well as New York? And my mill--’<br><br> ‘No, Scarlett. This is my last chance. I'll go North. If I go to<br> Atlanta and work for you, I'm lost forever.’<br><br> The word ‘lost--lost--lost’ dinged frighteningly in her heart like<br> a death bell sounding. Her eyes went quickly to his but they were<br> wide and crystal gray and they were looking through her and beyond<br> her at some fate she could not see, could not understand.<br><br> ‘Lost? Do you mean--have you done something the Atlanta Yankees<br> can get you for? I mean, about helping Tony get away or--or--<br> Oh, Ashley, you aren't in the Ku Klux, are you?’<br><br> His remote eyes came back to her swiftly and he smiled a brief<br> smile that never reached his eyes.<br><br> ‘I had forgotten you were so literal. No, it's not the Yankees I'm<br> afraid of. I mean if I go to Atlanta and take help from you again,<br> I bury forever any hope of ever standing alone.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she sighed in quick relief, ‘if it's only that!’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ and he smiled again, the smile more wintry than before.<br> ‘Only that. Only my masculine pride, my self-respect and, if you<br> choose to so call it, my immortal soul.’<br><br> ‘But,’ she swung around on another tack, ‘you could gradually buy<br> the mill from me and it would be your own and then--’<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ he interrupted fiercely, ‘I tell you, no! There are<br> other reasons.’<br><br> ‘What reasons?’<br><br> ‘You know my reasons better than anyone in the world.’<br><br> ‘Oh--that? But--that'll be all right,’ she assured swiftly. ‘I<br> promised, you know, out in the orchard, last winter and I'll keep<br> my promise and--’<br><br> ‘Then you are surer of yourself than I am. I could not count on<br> myself to keep such a promise. I should not have said that but I<br> had to make you understand. Scarlett, I will not talk of this any<br> more. It's finished. When Will and Suellen marry, I am going to<br> New York.’<br><br> His eyes, wide and stormy, met hers for an instant and then he went<br> swiftly across the room. His hand was on the door knob. Scarlett<br> stared at him in agony. The interview was ended and she had lost.<br> Suddenly weak from the strain and sorrow of the last day and the<br> present disappointment, her nerves broke abruptly and she screamed:<br> ‘Oh, Ashley!’ And, flinging herself down on the sagging sofa, she<br> burst into wild crying.<br><br> She heard his uncertain footsteps leaving the door and his helpless<br> voice saying her name over and over above her head. There was a<br> swift pattering of feet racing up the hall from the kitchen and<br> Melanie burst into the room, her eyes wide with alarm.<br><br> ‘Scarlett . . . the baby isn't . . . ?’<br><br> Scarlett burrowed her head in the dusty upholstery and screamed<br> again.<br><br> ‘Ashley--he's so mean! So doggoned mean--so hateful!’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, what have you done to her?’ Melanie threw herself on<br> the floor beside the sofa and gathered Scarlett into her arms.<br> ‘What have you said? How could you! You might bring on the baby!<br> There, my darling, put your head on Melanie's shoulder! What is<br> wrong?’<br><br> ‘Ashley--he's so--so bullheaded and hateful!’<br><br> ‘Ashley, I'm surprised at you! Upsetting her so much and in her<br> condition and Mr. O'Hara hardly in his grave!’<br><br> ‘Don't you fuss at him!’ cried Scarlett illogically, raising her<br> head abruptly from Melanie's shoulder, her coarse black hair<br> tumbling out from its net and her face streaked with tears. ‘He's<br> got a right to do as he pleases!’<br><br> ‘Melanie,’ said Ashley, his face white, ‘let me explain. Scarlett<br> was kind enough to offer me a position in Atlanta as manager of one<br> of her mills--’<br><br> ‘Manager!’ cried Scarlett indignantly. ‘I offered him a half-<br> interest and he--’<br><br> ‘And I told her I had already made arrangements for us to go North<br> and she--’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ cried Scarlett, beginning to sob again, ‘I told him and told<br> him how much I needed him--how I couldn't get anybody to manage the<br> mill--how I was going to have this baby--and he refused to come!<br> And now--now, I'll have to sell the mill and I know I can't get<br> anything like a good price for it and I'll lose money and I guess<br> maybe we'll starve, but he won't care. He's so mean!’<br><br> She burrowed her head back into Melanie's thin shoulder and some of<br> the real anguish went from her as a flicker of hope woke in her.<br> She could sense that in Melanie's devoted heart she had an ally,<br> feel Melanie's indignation that anyone, even her beloved husband,<br> should make Scarlett cry. Melanie flew at Ashley like a small<br> determined dove and pecked him for the first time in her life.<br><br> ‘Ashley, how could you refuse her? And after all she's done for<br> us! How ungrateful you make us appear! And she so helpless now<br> with the bab-- How unchivalrous of you! She helped us when we<br> needed help and now you deny her when she needs you!’<br><br> Scarlett peeped slyly at Ashley and saw surprise and uncertainty<br> plain in his face as he looked into Melanie's dark indignant eyes.<br> Scarlett was surprised, too, at the vigor of Melanie's attack, for<br> she knew Melanie considered her husband beyond wifely reproaches<br> and thought his decisions second only to God's.<br><br> ‘Melanie . . .’ he began and then threw out his hands helplessly.<br><br> ‘Ashley, how can you hesitate? Think what she's done for us--for<br> me! I'd have died in Atlanta when Beau came if it hadn't been for<br> her! And she--yes, she killed a Yankee, defending us. Did you<br> know that? She killed a man for us. And she worked and slaved<br> before you and Will came home, just to keep food in our mouths.<br> And when I think of her plowing and picking cotton, I could just--<br> Oh, my darling!’ And she swooped her head and kissed Scarlett's<br> tumbled hair in fierce loyalty. ‘And now the first time she asks<br> us to do something for her--’<br><br> ‘You don't need to tell me what she has done for us.’<br><br> ‘And Ashley, just think! Besides helping her, just think what<br> it'll mean for us to live in Atlanta among our own people and not<br> have to live with Yankees! There'll be Auntie and Uncle Henry and<br> all our friends, and Beau can have lots of playmates and go to<br> school. If we went North, we couldn't let him go to school and<br> associate with Yankee children and have pickaninnies in his class!<br> We'd have to have a governess and I don't see how we'd afford--’<br><br> ‘Melanie,’ said Ashley and his voice was deadly quiet, ‘do you<br> really want to go to Atlanta so badly? You never said so when we<br> talked about going to New York. You never intimated--’<br><br> ‘Oh, but when we talked about going to New York, I thought there<br> was nothing for you in Atlanta and, besides, it wasn't my place to<br> say anything. It's a wife's duty to go where her husband goes.<br> But now that Scarlett needs us so and has a position that only you<br> can fill we can go home! Home!’ Her voice was rapturous as she<br> squeezed Scarlett. ‘And I'll see Five Points again and Peachtree<br> road and--and-- Oh, how I've missed them all! And maybe we could<br> have a little home of our own! I wouldn't care how little and<br> tacky it was but--a home of our own!’<br><br> Her eyes blazed with enthusiasm and happiness and the two stared at<br> her, Ashley with a queer stunned look, Scarlett with surprise<br> mingled with shame. It had never occurred to her that Melanie<br> missed Atlanta so much and longed to be back, longed for a home of<br> her own. She had seemed so contented at Tara it came to Scarlett<br> as a shock that she was homesick.<br><br> ‘Oh Scarlett, how good of you to plan all this for us! You knew<br> how I longed for home!’<br><br> As usual when confronted by Melanie's habit of attributing worthy<br> motives where no worth existed, Scarlett was ashamed and irritated,<br> and suddenly she could not meet either Ashley's or Melanie's eyes.<br><br> ‘We could get a little house of our own. Do you realize that we've<br> been married five years and never had a home?’<br><br> ‘You can stay with us at Aunt Pitty's. That's your home,’ mumbled<br> Scarlett, toying with a pillow and keeping her eyes down to hide<br> dawning triumph in them as she felt the tide turning her way.<br><br> ‘No, but thank you just the same, darling. That would crowd us so.<br> We'll get a house-- Oh, Ashley, do say Yes!’<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ said Ashley and his voice was toneless, ‘look at me.’<br><br> Startled, she looked up and met gray eyes that were bitter and full<br> of tired futility.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, I will come to Atlanta. . . . I cannot fight you both.’<br><br> He turned and walked out of the room. Some of the triumph in her<br> heart was dulled by a nagging fear. The look in his eyes when he<br> spoke had been the same as when he said he would be lost forever if<br> he came to Atlanta.<br><br> <br><br> After Suellen and Will married and Carreen went off to Charleston<br> to the convent, Ashley, Melanie and Beau came to Atlanta, bringing<br> Dilcey with them to cook and nurse. Prissy and Pork were left at<br> Tara until such a time as Will could get other darkies to help him<br> in the fields and then they, too, would come to town.<br><br> The little brick house that Ashley took for his family was on Ivy<br> Street directly behind Aunt Pitty's house and the two back yards<br> ran together, divided only by a ragged overgrown privet hedge.<br> Melanie had chosen it especially for this reason. She said, on the<br> first morning of her return to Atlanta as she laughed and cried and<br> embraced Scarlett and Aunt Pitty, she had been separated from her<br> loved ones for so long that she could never be close enough to them<br> again.<br><br> The house had originally been two stories high but the upper floor<br> had been destroyed by shells during the siege and the owner,<br> returning after the surrender, had lacked the money to replace it.<br> He had contented himself with putting a flat roof on the remaining<br> first floor which gave the building the squat, disproportionate<br> look of a child's playhouse built of shoe boxes. The house was<br> high from the ground, built over a large cellar, and the long<br> sweeping flight of stairs which reached it made it look slightly<br> ridiculous. But the flat, squashed look of the place was partly<br> redeemed by the two fine old oaks which shaded it and a dusty-<br> leaved magnolia, splotched with white blossoms, standing beside the<br> front steps. The lawn was wide and green with thick clover and<br> bordering it was a straggling, unkempt privet hedge, interlaced<br> with sweet-smelling honeysuckle vines. Here and there in the<br> grass, roses threw out sprangles from crushed old stems and pink<br> and white crepe myrtle bloomed as valiantly as if war had not<br> passed over their heads and Yankee horses gnawed their boughs.<br><br> Scarlett thought it quite the ugliest dwelling she had ever seen<br> but, to Melanie, Twelve Oaks in all its grandeur had not been more<br> beautiful. It was home and she and Ashley and Beau were at last<br> together under their own roof.<br><br> India Wilkes came back from Macon, where she and Honey had lived<br> since 1864, and took up her residence with her brother, crowding<br> the occupants of the little house. But Ashley and Melanie welcomed<br> her. Times had changed, money was scarce, but nothing had altered<br> the rule of Southern life that families always made room gladly for<br> indigent or unmarried female relatives.<br><br> Honey had married and, so India said, married beneath her, a coarse<br> Westerner from Mississippi who had settled in Macon. He had a red<br> face and a loud voice and jolly ways. India had not approved of<br> the match and, not approving, had not been happy in her brother-in-<br> law's home. She welcomed the news that Ashley now had a home of<br> his own, so she could remove herself from uncongenial surroundings<br> and also from the distressing sight of her sister so fatuously<br> happy with a man unworthy of her.<br><br> The rest of the family privately thought that the giggling and<br> simple-minded Honey had done far better than could be expected and<br> they marveled that she had caught any man. Her husband was a<br> gentleman and a man of some means; but to India, born in Georgia<br> and reared in Virginia traditions, anyone not from the eastern<br> seaboard was a boor and a barbarian. Probably Honey's husband was<br> as happy to be relieved of her company as she was to leave him, for<br> India was not easy to live with these days.<br><br> The mantle of spinsterhood was definitely on her shoulders now.<br> She was twenty-five and looked it, and so there was no longer any<br> need for her to try to be attractive. Her pale lashless eyes<br> looked directly and uncompromisingly upon the world and her thin<br> lips were ever set in haughty tightness. There was an air of<br> dignity and pride about her now that, oddly enough, became her<br> better than the determined girlish sweetness of her days at Twelve<br> Oaks. The position she held was almost that of a widow. Everyone<br> knew that Stuart Tarleton would have married her had he not been<br> killed at Gettysburg, and so she was accorded the respect due a<br> woman who had been wanted if not wed.<br><br> The six rooms of the little house on Ivy Street were soon scantily<br> furnished with the cheapest pine and oak furniture in Frank's store<br> for, as Ashley was penniless and forced to buy on credit, he<br> refused anything except the least expensive and bought only the<br> barest necessities. This embarrassed Frank who was fond of Ashley<br> and it distressed Scarlett. Both she and Frank would willingly<br> have given, without any charge, the finest mahogany and carved<br> rosewood in the store, but the Wilkeses obstinately refused. Their<br> house was painfully ugly and bare and Scarlett hated to see Ashley<br> living in the uncarpeted, uncurtained rooms. But he did not seem<br> to notice his surroundings and Melanie, having her own home for the<br> first time since her marriage, was so happy she was actually proud<br> of the place. Scarlett would have suffered agonies of humiliation<br> at having friends find her without draperies and carpets and<br> cushions and the proper number of chairs and teacups and spoons.<br> But Melanie did the honors of her house as though plush curtains<br> and brocade sofas were hers.<br><br> For all her obvious happiness, Melanie was not well. Little Beau<br> had cost her her health, and the hard work she had done at Tara<br> since his birth had taken further toll of her strength. She was so<br> thin that her small bones seemed ready to come through her white<br> skin. Seen from a distance, romping about the back yard with her<br> child, she looked like a little girl, for her waist was unbelievably<br> tiny and she had practically no figure. She had no bust and her<br> hips were as flat as little Beau's and as she had neither the pride<br> nor the good sense (so Scarlett thought) to sew ruffles in the bosom<br> of her basque or pads on the back of her corsets, her thinness was<br> very obvious. Like her body, her face was too thin and too pale and<br> her silky brows, arched and delicate as a butterfly's feelers, stood<br> out too blackly against her colorless skin. In her small face, her<br> eyes were too large for beauty, the dark smudges under them making<br> them appear enormous, but the expression in them had not altered<br> since the days of her unworried girlhood. War and constant pain and<br> hard work had been powerless against their sweet tranquillity. They<br> were the eyes of a happy woman, a woman around whom storms might<br> blow without ever ruffling the serene core of her being.<br><br> How did she keep her eyes that way, thought Scarlett, looking at<br> her enviously. She knew her own eyes sometimes had the look of a<br> hungry cat. What was it Rhett had said once about Melanie's eyes--<br> some foolishness about them being like candles? Oh, yes, like two<br> good deeds in a naughty world. Yes, they were like candles,<br> candles shielded from every wind, two soft lights glowing with<br> happiness at being home again among her friends.<br><br> The little house was always full of company. Melanie had been a<br> favorite even as a child and the town flocked to welcome her home<br> again. Everyone brought presents for the house, bric-a-brac,<br> pictures, a silver spoon or two, linen pillow cases, napkins, rag<br> rugs, small articles which they had saved from Sherman and<br> treasured but which they now swore were of no earthly use to them.<br><br> Old men who had campaigned in Mexico with her father came to see<br> her, bringing visitors to meet ‘old Colonel Hamilton's sweet<br> daughter.’ Her mother's old friends clustered about her, for<br> Melanie had a respectful deference to her elders that was very<br> soothing to dowagers in these wild days when young people seemed to<br> have forgotten all their manners. Her contemporaries, the young<br> wives, mothers and widows, loved her because she had suffered what<br> they had suffered, had not become embittered and always lent them a<br> sympathetic ear. The young people came, as young people always<br> come, simply because they had a good time at her home and met there<br> the friends they wanted to meet.<br><br> Around Melanie's tactful and self-effacing person, there rapidly<br> grew up a clique of young and old who represented what was left of<br> the best of Atlanta's ante-bellum society, all poor in purse, all<br> proud in family, die-hards of the stoutest variety. It was as if<br> Atlanta society, scattered and wrecked by war, depleted by death,<br> bewildered by change, had found in her an unyielding nucleus about<br> which it could re-form.<br><br> Melanie was young but she had in her all the qualities this<br> embattled remnant prized, poverty and pride in poverty, uncomplaining<br> courage, gaiety, hospitality, kindness and, above all, loyalty to<br> all the old traditions. Melanie refused to change, refused even to<br> admit that there was any reason to change in a changing world.<br> Under her roof the old days seemed to come back again and people<br> took heart and felt even more contemptuous of the tide of wild life<br> and high living that was sweeping the Carpetbaggers and newly rich<br> Republicans along.<br><br> When they looked into her young face and saw there the inflexible<br> loyalty to the old days, they could forget, for a moment, the<br> traitors within their own class who were causing fury, fear and<br> heartbreak. And there were many such. There were men of good<br> family, driven to desperation by poverty, who had gone over to the<br> enemy, become Republicans and accepted positions from the<br> conquerors, so their families would not be on charity. There were<br> young ex-soldiers who lacked the courage to face the long years<br> necessary to build up fortunes. These youngsters, following the<br> lead of Rhett Butler, went hand in hand with the Carpetbaggers in<br> money-making schemes of unsavory kinds.<br><br> Worst of all the traitors were the daughters of some of Atlanta's<br> most prominent families. These girls who had come to maturity<br> since the surrender had only childish memories of the war and<br> lacked the bitterness that animated their elders. They had lost no<br> husbands, no lovers. They had few recollections of past wealth and<br> splendor--and the Yankee officers were so handsome and finely<br> dressed and so carefree. And they gave such splendid balls and<br> drove such fine horses and simply worshiped Southern girls! They<br> treated them like queens and were so careful not to injure their<br> touchy pride and, after all--why not associate with them?<br><br> They were so much more attractive than the town swains who dressed<br> so shabbily and were so serious and worked so hard that they had<br> little time to play. So there had been a number of elopements with<br> Yankee officers which broke the hearts of Atlanta families. There<br> were brothers who passed sisters on the streets and did not speak<br> and mothers and fathers who never mentioned daughters' names.<br> Remembering these tragedies, a cold dread ran in the veins of those<br> whose motto was ‘No surrender’--a dread which the very sight of<br> Melanie's soft but unyielding face dispelled. She was, as the<br> dowagers said, such an excellent and wholesome example to the young<br> girls of the town. And, because she made no parade of her virtues<br> the young girls did not resent her.<br><br> It never occurred to Melanie that she was becoming the leader of a<br> new society. She only thought the people were nice to come to see<br> her and to want her in their little sewing circles, cotillion clubs<br> and musical societies. Atlanta had always been musical and loved<br> good music, despite the sneering comments of sister cities of the<br> South concerning the town's lack of culture, and there was now an<br> enthusiastic resurrection of interest that grew stronger as the<br> times grew harder and more tense. It was easier to forget the<br> impudent black faces in the streets and the blue uniforms of the<br> garrison while they were listening to music.<br><br> Melanie was a little embarrassed to find herself at the head of the<br> newly formed Saturday Night Musical Circle. She could not account<br> for her elevation to this position except by the fact that she<br> could accompany anyone on the piano, even the Misses McLure who<br> were tone deaf but who would sing duets.<br><br> The truth of the matter was that Melanie had diplomatically managed<br> to amalgamate the Lady Harpists, the Gentlemen's Glee Club and the<br> Young Ladies Mandolin and Guitar Society with the Saturday Night<br> Musical Circle, so that now Atlanta had music worth listening to.<br> In fact, the Circle's rendition of The Bohemian Girl was said by<br> many to be far superior to professional performances heard in New<br> York and New Orleans. It was after she had maneuvered the Lady<br> Harpists into the fold that Mrs. Merriwether said to Mrs. Meade and<br> Mrs. Whiting that they must have Melanie at the head of the Circle.<br> If she could get on with the Harpists, she could get on with<br> anyone, Mrs. Merriwether declared. That lady herself played the<br> organ for the choir at the Methodist Church and, as an organist,<br> had scant respect for harps or harpists.<br><br> Melanie had also been made secretary for both the Association for<br> the Beautification of the Graves of Our Glorious Dead and the<br> Sewing Circle for the Widows and Orphans of the Confederacy. This<br> new honor came to her after an exciting joint meeting of those<br> societies which threatened to end in violence and the severance of<br> lifelong ties of friendship. The question had arisen at the<br> meeting as to whether or not weeds should be removed from the<br> graves of the Union soldiers near those of Confederate soldiers.<br> The appearance of the scraggly Yankee mounds defeated all the<br> efforts of the ladies to beautify those of their own dead.<br> Immediately the fires which smoldered beneath tight basques flamed<br> wildly and the two organizations split up and glared hostilely.<br> The Sewing Circle was in favor of the removal of the weeds, the<br> Ladies of the Beautification were violently opposed.<br><br> Mrs. Meade expressed the views of the latter group when she said:<br> ‘Dig up the weeds off Yankee graves? For two cents, I'd dig up all<br> the Yankees and throw them in the city dump!’<br><br> At these ringing words the two associations arose and every lady<br> spoke her mind and no one listened. The meeting was being held in<br> Mrs. Merriwether's parlor and Grandpa Merriwether, who had been<br> banished to the kitchen, reported afterwards that the noise sounded<br> just like the opening guns of the battle of Franklin. And, he<br> added, be guessed it was a dinged sight safer to be present at the<br> battle of Franklin than at the ladies' meeting.<br><br> Somehow Melanie made her way to the center of the excited throng<br> and somehow made her usually soft voice heard above the tumult.<br> Her heart was in her throat with fright at daring to address the<br> indignant gathering and her voice shook but she kept crying:<br> ‘Ladies! Please!’ till the din died down.<br><br> ‘I want to say--I mean, I've thought for a long time that--that not<br> only should we pull up the weeds but we should plant flowers on--<br> I--I don't care what you think but every time I go to take flowers<br> to dear Charlie's grave, I always put some on the grave of an<br> unknown Yankee which is near by. It--it looks so forlorn!’<br><br> The excitement broke out again in louder words and this time the<br> two organizations merged and spoke as one.<br><br> ‘On Yankee graves! Oh, Melly, how could you!’ ‘And they killed<br> Charlie!’ ‘They almost killed you!’ ‘Why, the Yankees might have<br> killed Beau when he was born!’ ‘They tried to burn you out of<br> Tara!’<br><br> Melanie held onto the back of her chair for support, almost<br> crumpling beneath the weight of a disapproval she had never known<br> before.<br><br> ‘Oh, ladies!’ she cried, pleading. ‘Please, let me finish! I know<br> I haven't the right to speak on this matter, for none of my loved<br> ones were killed except Charlie, and I know where he lies, thank<br> God! But there are so many among us today who do not know where<br> their sons and husbands and brothers are buried and--’<br><br> She choked and there was a dead silence in the room.<br><br> Mrs. Meade's flaming eyes went somber. She had made the long trip<br> to Gettysburg after the battle to bring back Darcy's body but no<br> one had been able to tell her where he was buried. Somewhere in<br> some hastily dug trench in the enemy's country. And Mrs. Allan's<br> mouth quivered. Her husband and brother had been on that ill-<br> starred raid Morgan made into Ohio and the last information she had<br> of them was that they fell on the banks of the river, just as the<br> Yankee cavalry stormed up. She did not know where they lay. Mrs.<br> Allison's son had died in a Northern prison camp and she, the<br> poorest of the poor, was unable to bring his body home. There were<br> others who had read on casualty lists: ‘Missing--believed dead,’<br> and in those words had learned the last news they were ever to<br> learn of men they had seen march away.<br><br> They turned to Melanie with eyes that said: ‘Why do you open these<br> wounds again? These are the wounds that never heal--the wounds of<br> not knowing where they lie.’<br><br> Melanie's voice gathered strength in the stillness of the room.<br><br> ‘Their graves are somewhere up in the Yankees' country, just like<br> the Yankee graves are here, and oh, how awful it would be to know<br> that some Yankee woman said to dig them up and--’<br><br> Mrs. Meade made a small, dreadful sound.<br><br> ‘But how nice it would be to know that some good Yankee woman--<br> And there must be SOME good Yankee women. I don't care what people<br> say, they can't all be bad! How nice it would be to know that they<br> pulled weeds off our men's graves and brought flowers to them, even<br> if they were enemies. If Charlie were dead in the North it would<br> comfort me to know that someone-- And I don't care what you ladies<br> think of me,’ her voice broke again, ‘I will withdraw from both<br> clubs and I'll--I'll pull up every weed off every Yankee's grave I<br> can find and I'll plant flowers, too--and--I just dare anyone to<br> stop me!’<br><br> With this final defiance Melanie burst into tears and tried to make<br> her stumbling way to the door.<br><br> Grandpa Merriwether, safe in the masculine confines of the Girl of<br> the Period Saloon an hour later, reported to Uncle Henry Hamilton<br> that after these words, everybody cried and embraced Melanie and it<br> all ended up in a love feast and Melanie was made secretary of both<br> organizations.<br><br> ‘And they are going to pull up the weeds. The hell of it is Dolly<br> said I'd be only too pleased to help do it, 'cause I didn't have<br> anything much else to do. I got nothing against the Yankees and I<br> think Miss Melly was right and the rest of those lady wild cats<br> wrong. But the idea of me pulling weeds at my time of life and<br> with my lumbago!’<br><br> Melanie was on the board of lady managers of the Orphans' Home and<br> assisted in the collection of books for the newly formed Young<br> Men's Library Association. Even the Thespians who gave amateur<br> plays once a month clamored for her. She was too timid to appear<br> behind the kerosene-lamp footlights, but she could make costumes<br> out of croker sacks if they were the only material available. It<br> was she who cast the deciding vote at the Shakespeare Reading<br> Circle that the bard's works should be varied with those of Mr.<br> Dickens and Mr. Bulwer-Lytton and not the poems of Lord Byron, as<br> had been suggested by a young and, Melanie privately feared, very<br> fast bachelor member of the Circle.<br><br> In the nights of the late summer her small, feebly lighted house<br> was always full of guests. There were never enough chairs to go<br> around and frequently ladies sat on the steps of the front porch<br> with men grouped about them on the banisters, on packing boxes or<br> on the lawn below. Sometimes when Scarlett saw guests sitting on<br> the grass, sipping tea, the only refreshment the Wilkeses could<br> afford, she wondered how Melanie could bring herself to expose her<br> poverty so shamelessly. Until Scarlett was able to furnish Aunt<br> Pitty's house as it had been before the war and serve her guests<br> good wine and juleps and baked ham and cold haunches of venison,<br> she had no intention of having guests in her house--especially<br> prominent guests, such as Melanie had.<br><br> General John B. Gordon, Georgia's great hero, was frequently there<br> with his family. Father Ryan, the poet-priest of the Confederacy,<br> never failed to call when passing through Atlanta. He charmed<br> gatherings there with his wit and seldom needed much urging to<br> recite his ‘Sword of Lee’ or his deathless ‘Conquered Banner,’<br> which never failed to make the ladies cry. Alex Stephens, late<br> Vice-President of the Confederacy, visited whenever in town and,<br> when the word went about that he was at Melanie's, the house was<br> filled and people sat for hours under the spell of the frail<br> invalid with the ringing voice. Usually there were a dozen<br> children present, nodding sleepily in their parents' arms, up hours<br> after their normal bedtime. No family wanted its children to miss<br> being able to say in after years that they had been kissed by the<br> great Vice-President or had shaken the hand that helped to guide<br> the Cause. Every person of importance who came to town found his<br> way to the Wilkes home and often they spent the night there. It<br> crowded the little flat-topped house, forced India to sleep on a<br> pallet in the cubbyhole that was Beau's nursery and sent Dilcey<br> speeding through the back hedge to borrow breakfast eggs from Aunt<br> Pitty's Cookie, but Melanie entertained them as graciously as if<br> hers was a mansion.<br><br> No, it did not occur to Melanie that people rallied round her as<br> round a worn and loved standard. And so she was both astounded and<br> embarrassed when Dr. Meade, after a pleasant evening at her house<br> where he acquitted himself nobly in reading the part of Macbeth,<br> kissed her hand and made observations in the voice he once used in<br> speaking of Our Glorious Cause.<br><br> ‘My dear Miss Melly, it is always a privilege and a pleasure to be<br> in your home, for you--and ladies like you--are the hearts of all<br> of us, all that we have left. They have taken the flower of our<br> manhood and the laughter of our young women. They have broken our<br> health, uprooted our lives and unsettled our habits. They have<br> ruined our prosperity, set us back fifty years and placed too heavy<br> a burden on the shoulders of our boys who should be in school and<br> our old men who should be sleeping in the sun. But we will build<br> back, because we have hearts like yours to build upon. And as long<br> as we have them, the Yankees can have the rest!’<br><br> <br><br> Until Scarlett's figure reached such proportions that even Aunt<br> Pitty's big black shawl did not conceal her condition, she and<br> Frank frequently slipped through the back hedge to join the summer-<br> night gatherings on Melanie's porch. Scarlett always sat well out<br> of the light, hidden in the protecting shadows where she was not<br> only inconspicuous but could, unobserved, watch Ashley's face to<br> her heart's content.<br><br> It was only Ashley who drew her to the house, for the conversations<br> bored and saddened her. They always followed a set pattern--first,<br> hard times; next, the political situation; and then, inevitably,<br> the war. The ladies bewailed the high prices of everything and<br> asked the gentlemen if they thought good times would ever come<br> back. And the omniscient gentlemen always said, indeed they would.<br> Merely a matter of time. Hard times were just temporary. The<br> ladies knew the gentlemen were lying and the gentlemen knew the<br> ladies knew they were lying. But they lied cheerfully just the<br> same and the ladies pretended to believe them. Everyone knew hard<br> times were here to stay.<br><br> Once the hard times were disposed of, the ladies spoke of the<br> increasing impudence of the negroes and the outrages of the<br> Carpetbaggers and the humiliation of having the Yankee soldiers<br> loafing on every corner. Did the gentlemen think the Yankees would<br> ever get through with reconstructing Georgia? The reassuring<br> gentlemen thought Reconstruction would be over in no time--that is,<br> just as soon as the Democrats could vote again. The ladies were<br> considerate enough not to ask when this would be. And having<br> finished with politics, the talk about the war began.<br><br> Whenever two former Confederates met anywhere, there was never but<br> one topic of conversation, and where a dozen or more gathered<br> together, it was a foregone conclusion that the war would be<br> spiritedly refought. And always the word ‘if’ had the most<br> prominent part in the talk.<br><br> ‘If England had recognized us--’ ‘If Jeff Davis had commandeered<br> all the cotton and gotten it to England before the blockade<br> tightened--’ ‘If Longstreet had obeyed orders at Gettysburg--’<br> ‘If Jeb Stuart hadn't been away on that raid when Marse Bob needed<br> him--’ ‘If we hadn't lost Stonewall Jackson--’ ‘If Vicksburg<br> hadn't fallen--’ ‘If we could have held on another year--’ And<br> always: ‘If they hadn't replaced Johnston with Hood--’ or ‘If<br> they'd put Hood in command at Dalton instead of Johnston--’<br><br> If! If! The soft drawling voices quickened with an old excitement<br> as they talked in the quiet darkness--infantryman, cavalryman,<br> cannoneer, evoking memories of the days when life was ever at high<br> tide, recalling the fierce heat of their midsummer in this forlorn<br> sunset of their winter.<br><br> ‘They don't talk of anything else,’ thought Scarlett. ‘Nothing but<br> the war. Always the war. And they'll never talk of anything but<br> the war. No, not until they die.’<br><br> She looked about, seeing little boys lying in the crooks of their<br> fathers' arms, breath coming fast, eyes glowing, as they heard of<br> midnight stories and wild cavalry dashes and flags planted on enemy<br> breastworks. They were hearing drums and bugles and the Rebel<br> yell, seeing footsore men going by in the rain with torn flags<br> slanting.<br><br> ‘And these children will never talk of anything else either.<br> They'll think it was wonderful and glorious to fight the Yankees<br> and come home blind and crippled--or not come home at all. They<br> all like to remember the war, to talk about it. But I don't. I<br> don't even like to think about it. I'd forget it all if I could--<br> oh, if I only could!’<br><br> She listened with flesh crawling as Melanie told tales of Tara,<br> making Scarlett a heroine as she faced the invaders and saved<br> Charles' sword, bragging how Scarlett had put out the fire.<br> Scarlett took no pleasure or pride in the memory of these things.<br> She did not want to think of them at all.<br><br> ‘Oh, why can't they forget? Why can't they look forward and not<br> back? We were fools to fight that war. And the sooner we forget<br> it, the better we'll be.’<br><br> But no one wanted to forget, no one, it seemed, except herself,<br> so Scarlett was glad when she could truthfully tell Melanie that<br> she was embarrassed at appearing, even in the darkness. This<br> explanation was readily understood by Melanie who was hypersensitive<br> about all matters relating to childbirth. Melanie wanted another<br> baby badly, but both Dr. Meade and Dr. Fontaine had said another<br> child would cost her her life. So, only half resigned to her fate,<br> she spent most of her time with Scarlett, vicariously enjoying a<br> pregnancy not her own. To Scarlett, scarcely wanting her coming<br> child and irritated at its untimeliness, this attitude seemed the<br> height of sentimental stupidity. But she had a guilty sense of<br> pleasure that the doctors' edict had made impossible any real<br> intimacy between Ashley and his wife.<br><br> Scarlett saw Ashley frequently now but she never saw him alone. He<br> came by the house every night on his way home from the mill to<br> report on the day's work, but Frank and Pitty were usually present<br> or, worse still, Melanie and India. She could only ask<br> businesslike questions and make suggestions and then say: ‘It was<br> nice of you to come by. Good night.’<br><br> If only she wasn't having a baby! Here was a God-given opportunity<br> to ride out to the mill with him every morning, through the lonely<br> woods, far from prying eyes, where they could imagine themselves<br> back in the County again in the unhurried days before the war.<br><br> No, she wouldn't try to make him say one word of love! She<br> wouldn't refer to love in any way. She'd sworn an oath to herself<br> that she would never do that again. But, perhaps if she were alone<br> with him once more, he might drop that mask of impersonal courtesy<br> he had worn since coming to Atlanta. Perhaps he might be his old<br> self again, be the Ashley she had known before the barbecue, before<br> any word of love had been spoken between them. If they could not<br> be lovers, they could be friends again and she could warm her cold<br> and lonely heart in the glow of his friendship.<br><br> ‘If only I could get this baby over and done with,’ she thought<br> impatiently, ‘then I could ride with him every day and we could<br> talk--’<br><br> It was not only the desire to be with him that made her writhe with<br> helpless impatience at her confinement. The mills needed her. The<br> mills had been losing money ever since she retired from active<br> supervision, leaving Hugh and Ashley in charge.<br><br> Hugh was so incompetent, for all that he tried so hard. He was a<br> poor trader and a poorer boss of labor. Anyone could Jew him down<br> on prices. If any slick contractor chose to say that the lumber<br> was of an inferior grade and not worth the price asked, Hugh felt<br> that all a gentleman could do was to apologize and take a lower<br> price. When she heard of the price he received for a thousand feet<br> of flooring, she burst into angry tears. The best grade of<br> flooring the mill had ever turned out and he had practically given<br> it away! And he couldn't manage his labor crews. The negroes<br> insisted on being paid every day and they frequently got drunk on<br> their wages and did not turn up for work the next morning. On<br> these occasions Hugh was forced to hunt up new workmen and the mill<br> was late in starting. With these difficulties Hugh didn't get into<br> town to sell the lumber for days on end.<br><br> Seeing the profits slip from Hugh's fingers, Scarlett became<br> frenzied at her impotence and his stupidity. Just as soon as the<br> baby was born and she could go back to work, she would get rid of<br> Hugh and hire some one else. Anyone would do better. And she<br> would never fool with free niggers again. How could anyone get any<br> work done with free niggers quitting all the time?<br><br> ‘Frank,’ she said, after a stormy interview with Hugh over his<br> missing workmen, ‘I've about made up my mind that I'll lease<br> convicts to work the mills. A while back I was talking to Johnnie<br> Gallegher, Tommy Wellburn's foreman, about the trouble we were<br> having getting any work out of the darkies and he asked me why I<br> didn't get convicts. It sounds like a good idea to me. He said I<br> could sublease them for next to nothing and feed them dirt cheap.<br> And he said I could get work out of them in any way I liked,<br> without having the Freedman's Bureau swarming down on me like<br> hornets, sticking their bills into things that aren't any of their<br> business. And just as soon as Johnnie Gallegher's contract with<br> Tommy is up, I'm going to hire him to run Hugh's mill. Any man who<br> can get work out of that bunch of wild Irish he bosses can<br> certainly get plenty of work out of convicts.’<br><br> Convicts! Frank was speechless. Leasing convicts was the very<br> worst of all the wild schemes Scarlett had ever suggested, worse<br> even than her notion of building a saloon.<br><br> At least, it seemed worse to Frank and the conservative circles in<br> which he moved. This new system of leasing convicts had come into<br> being because of the poverty of the state after the war. Unable to<br> support the convicts, the State was hiring them out to those<br> needing large labor crews in the building of railroads, in<br> turpentine forests and lumber camps. While Frank and his quiet<br> churchgoing friends realized the necessity of the system, they<br> deplored it just the same. Many of them had not even believed in<br> slavery and they thought this was far worse than slavery had ever<br> been.<br><br> And Scarlett wanted to lease convicts! Frank knew that if she did<br> he could never hold up his head again. This was far worse than<br> owning and operating the mills herself, or anything else she had<br> done. His past objections had always been coupled with the<br> question: ‘What will people say?’ But this--this went deeper than<br> fear of public opinion. He felt that it was a traffic in human<br> bodies on a par with prostitution, a sin that would be on his soul<br> if he permitted her to do it.<br><br> From this conviction of wrongness, Frank gathered courage to forbid<br> Scarlett to do such a thing, and so strong were his remarks that<br> she, startled, relapsed into silence. Finally to quiet him, she<br> said meekly she hadn't really meant it. She was just so outdone<br> with Hugh and the free niggers she had lost her temper. Secretly,<br> she still thought about it and with some longing. Convict labor<br> would settle one of her hardest problems, but if Frank was going to<br> take on so about it--<br><br> She sighed. If even one of the mills were making money, she could<br> stand it. But Ashley was faring little better with his mill than<br> Hugh.<br><br> At first Scarlett was shocked and disappointed that Ashley did not<br> immediately take hold and make the mill pay double what it had paid<br> under her management. He was so smart and he had read so many<br> books and there was no reason at all why he should not make a<br> brilliant success and lots of money. But he was no more successful<br> than Hugh. His inexperience, his errors, his utter lack of<br> business judgment and his scruples about close dealing were the<br> same as Hugh's.<br><br> Scarlett's love hastily found excuses for him and she did not<br> consider the two men in the same light. Hugh was just hopelessly<br> stupid, while Ashley was merely new at the business. Still,<br> unbidden, came the thought that Ashley could never make a quick<br> estimate in his head and give a price that was correct, as she<br> could. And she sometimes wondered if he'd ever learn to<br> distinguish between planking and sills. And because he was a<br> gentleman and himself trustworthy, he trusted every scoundrel who<br> came along and several times would have lost money for her if she<br> had not tactfully intervened. And if he liked a person--and he<br> seemed to like so many people!--he sold them lumber on credit<br> without ever thinking to find out if they had money in the bank or<br> property. He was as bad as Frank in that respect.<br><br> But surely he would learn! And while he was learning she had a<br> fond and maternal indulgence and patience for his errors. Every<br> evening when he called at her house, weary and discouraged, she was<br> tireless in her tactful, helpful suggestions. But for all her<br> encouragement and cheer, there was a queer dead look in his eyes.<br> She could not understand it and it frightened her. He was<br> different, so different from the man he used to be. If only she<br> could see him alone, perhaps she could discover the reason.<br><br> The situation gave her many sleepless nights. She worried about<br> Ashley, both because she knew he was unhappy and because she knew<br> his unhappiness wasn't helping him to become a good lumber dealer.<br> It was a torture to have her mills in the hands of two men with no<br> more business sense than Hugh and Ashley, heartbreaking to see her<br> competitors taking her best customers away when she had worked so<br> hard and planned so carefully for these helpless months. Oh, if<br> she could only get back to work again! She would take Ashley in<br> hand and then he would certainly learn. And Johnnie Gallegher<br> could run the other mill, and she could handle the selling, and<br> then everything would be fine. As for Hugh, he could drive a<br> delivery wagon if he still wanted to work for her. That was all he<br> was good for.<br><br> Of course, Gallegher looked like an unscrupulous man, for all of<br> his smartness, but--who else could she get? Why had the other men<br> who were both smart and honest been so perverse about working for<br> her? If she only had one of them working for her now in place of<br> Hugh, she wouldn't have to worry so much, but--<br><br> Tommy Wellburn, in spite of his crippled back, was the busiest<br> contractor in town and coining money, so people said. Mrs.<br> Merriwether and Rene were prospering and now had opened a bakery<br> downtown. Rene was managing it with true French thrift and Grandpa<br> Merriwether, glad to escape from his chimney corner, was driving<br> Rene's pie wagon. The Simmons boys were so busy they were<br> operating their brick kiln with three shifts of labor a day. And<br> Kells Whiting was cleaning up money with his hair straightener,<br> because he told the negroes they wouldn't ever be permitted to vote<br> the Republican ticket if they had kinky hair.<br><br> It was the same with all the smart young men she knew, the doctors,<br> the lawyers, the storekeepers. The apathy which had clutched them<br> immediately after the war had completely disappeared and they were<br> too busy building their own fortunes to help her build hers. The<br> ones who were not busy were the men of Hugh's type--or Ashley's.<br><br> What a mess it was to try to run a business and have a baby too!<br><br> ‘I'll never have another one,’ she decided firmly. ‘I'm not going<br> to be like other women and have a baby every year. Good Lord, that<br> would mean six months out of the year when I'd have to be away from<br> the mills! And I see now I can't afford to be away from them even<br> one day. I shall simply tell Frank that I won't have any more<br> children.’<br><br> Frank wanted a big family, but she could manage Frank somehow. Her<br> mind was made up. This was her last child. The mills were far<br> more important.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLII<br><br> <br> Scarlett's child was a girl, a small bald-headed mite, ugly as a<br> hairless monkey and absurdly like Frank. No one except the doting<br> father could see anything beautiful about her, but the neighbors<br> were charitable enough to say that all ugly babies turned out<br> pretty, eventually. She was named Ella Lorena, Ella for her<br> grandmother Ellen, and Lorena because it was the most fashionable<br> name of the day for girls, even as Robert E. Lee and Stonewall<br> Jackson were popular for boys and Abraham Lincoln and Emancipation<br> for negro children.<br><br> She was born in the middle of a week when frenzied excitement<br> gripped Atlanta and the air was tense with expectation of disaster.<br> A negro who had boasted of rape had actually been arrested, but<br> before he could be brought to trial the jail had been raided by the<br> Ku Klux Klan and he had been quietly hanged. The Klan had acted to<br> save the as yet unnamed victim from having to testify in open<br> court. Rather than have her appear and advertise her shame, her<br> father and brother would have shot her, so lynching the negro<br> seemed a sensible solution to the townspeople, in fact, the only<br> decent solution possible. But the military authorities were in a<br> fury. They saw no reason why the girl should mind testifying<br> publicly.<br><br> The soldiers made arrests right and left, swearing to wipe out the<br> Klan if they had to put every white man in Atlanta in jail. The<br> negroes, frightened and sullen, muttered of retaliatory house<br> burnings. The air was thick with rumors of wholesale hangings by<br> the Yankees should the guilty parties be found and of a concerted<br> uprising against the whites by the negroes. The people of the town<br> stayed at home behind locked doors and shuttered windows, the men<br> fearing to go to their businesses and leave their women and<br> children unprotected.<br><br> Scarlett, lying exhausted in bed, feebly and silently thanked God<br> that Ashley had too much sense to belong to the Klan and Frank was<br> too old and poor spirited. How dreadful it would be to know that<br> the Yankees might swoop down and arrest them at any minute! Why<br> didn't the crack-brained young fools in the Klan leave bad enough<br> alone and not stir up the Yankees like this? Probably the girl<br> hadn't been raped after all. Probably she'd just been frightened<br> silly and, because of her, a lot of men might lose their lives.<br><br> In this atmosphere, as nerve straining as watching a slow fuse burn<br> toward a barrel of gunpowder, Scarlett came rapidly back to<br> strength. The healthy vigor which had carried her through the hard<br> days at Tara stood her in good stead now, and within two weeks of<br> Ella Lorena's birth she was strong enough to sit up and chafe at<br> her inactivity. In three weeks she was up, declaring she had to<br> see to the mills. They were standing idle because both Hugh and<br> Ashley feared to leave their families alone all day.<br><br> Then the blow fell.<br><br> Frank, full of the pride of new fatherhood, summoned up courage<br> enough to forbid Scarlett leaving the house while conditions were<br> so dangerous. His commands would not have worried her at all and<br> she would have gone about her business in spite of them, if he had<br> not put her horse and buggy in the livery stable and ordered that<br> they should not be surrendered to anyone except himself. To make<br> matters worse, he and Mammy had patiently searched the house while<br> she was ill and unearthed her hidden store of money. And Frank had<br> deposited it in the bank in his own name, so now she could not even<br> hire a rig.<br><br> Scarlett raged at both Frank and Mammy, then was reduced to begging<br> and finally cried all one morning like a furious thwarted child.<br> But for all her pains she heard only: ‘There, Sugar! You're just<br> a sick little girl.’ And: ‘Miss Scarlett, ef you doan quit<br> cahyin' on so, you gwine sour yo' milk an' de baby have colic, sho<br> as gun's iron.’<br><br> In a furious temper, Scarlett charged through her back yard to<br> Melanie's house and there unburdened herself at the top of her<br> voice, declaring she would walk to the mills, she would go about<br> Atlanta telling everyone what a varmint she had married, she would<br> not be treated like a naughty simple-minded child. She would carry<br> a pistol and shoot anyone who threatened her. She had shot one man<br> and she would love, yes, love to shoot another. She would--<br><br> Melanie who feared to venture onto her own front porch was appalled<br> by such threats.<br><br> ‘Oh, you must not risk yourself! I should die if anything happened<br> to you! Oh, please--’<br><br> ‘I will! I will! I will walk--’<br><br> Melanie looked at her and saw that this was not the hysteria of a<br> woman still weak from childbirth. There was the same breakneck,<br> headlong determination in Scarlett's face that Melanie had often<br> seen in Gerald O'Hara's face when his mind was made up. She put<br> her arms around Scarlett's waist and held her tightly.<br><br> ‘It's all my fault for not being brave like you and for keeping<br> Ashley at home with me all this time when he should have been at<br> the mill. Oh, dear! I'm such a ninny! Darling, I'll tell Ashley<br> I'm not a bit frightened and I'll come over and stay with you and<br> Aunt Pitty and he can go back to work and--’<br><br> Not even to herself would Scarlett admit that she did not think<br> Ashley could cope with the situation alone and she shouted:<br> ‘You'll do nothing of the kind! What earthly good would Ashley do<br> at work if he was worried about you every minute? Everybody is<br> just so hateful! Even Uncle Peter refuses to go out with me! But<br> I don't care! I'll go alone. I'll walk every step of the way and<br> pick up a crew of darkies somewhere--’<br><br> ‘Oh, no! You mustn't do that! Something dreadful might happen to<br> you. They say that Shantytown settlement on the Decatur road is<br> just full of mean darkies and you'd have to pass right by it. Let<br> me think-- Darling, promise me you won't do anything today and<br> I'll think of something. Promise me you'll go home and lie down.<br> You look right peaked. Promise me.’<br><br> Because she was too exhausted by her anger to do otherwise,<br> Scarlett sulkily promised and went home, haughtily refusing any<br> overtures of peace from her household.<br><br> That afternoon a strange figure stumped through Melanie's hedge and<br> across Pitty's back yard. Obviously, he was one of those men whom<br> Mammy and Dilcey referred to as ‘de riff-raff whut Miss Melly pick<br> up off de streets an' let sleep in her cellar.’<br><br> There were three rooms in the basement of Melanie's house which<br> formerly had been servants' quarters and a wine room. Now Dilcey<br> occupied one, and the other two were in constant use by a stream of<br> miserable and ragged transients. No one but Melanie knew whence<br> they came or where they were going and no one but she knew where<br> she collected them. Perhaps the negroes were right and she did<br> pick them up from the streets. But even as the great and the near<br> great gravitated to her small parlor, so unfortunates found their<br> way to her cellar where they were fed, bedded and sent on their way<br> with packages of food. Usually the occupants of the rooms were<br> former Confederate soldiers of the rougher, illiterate type,<br> homeless men, men without families, beating their way about the<br> country in hope of finding work.<br><br> Frequently, brown and withered country women with broods of tow-<br> haired silent children spent the night there, women widowed by the<br> war, dispossessed of their farms, seeking relatives who were<br> scattered and lost. Sometimes the neighborhood was scandalized by<br> the presence of foreigners, speaking little or no English, who had<br> been drawn South by glowing tales of fortunes easily made. Once a<br> Republican had slept there. At least, Mammy insisted he was a<br> Republican, saying she could smell a Republican, same as a horse<br> could smell a rattlesnake; but no one believed Mammy's story, for<br> there must be some limit even to Melanie's charity. At least<br> everyone hoped so.<br><br> Yes, thought Scarlett, sitting on the side porch in the pale<br> November sunshine with the baby on her lap, he is one of Melanie's<br> lame dogs. And he's really lame, at that!<br><br> The man who was making his way across the back yard stumped, like<br> Will Benteen, on a wooden leg. He was a tall, thin old man with a<br> bald head, which shone pinkishly dirty, and a grizzled beard so<br> long he could tuck it in his belt. He was over sixty, to judge by<br> his hard, seamed face, but there was no sag of age to his body. He<br> was lank and ungainly but, even with his wooden peg, he moved as<br> swiftly as a snake.<br><br> He mounted the steps and came toward her and, even before he spoke,<br> revealing in his tones a twang and a burring of ‘r s’ unusual in<br> the lowlands, Scarlett knew that he was mountain born. For all his<br> dirty, ragged clothes there was about him, as about most<br> mountaineers, an air of fierce silent pride that permitted no<br> liberties and tolerated no foolishness. His beard was stained with<br> tobacco juice and a large wad in his jaw made his face look<br> deformed. His nose was thin and craggy, his eyebrows bushy and<br> twisted into witches' locks and a lush growth of hair sprang from<br> his ears, giving them the tufted look of a lynx's ears. Beneath<br> his brow was one hollow socket from which a scar ran down his<br> cheek, carving a diagonal line through his beard. The other eye<br> was small, pale and cold, an unwinking and remorseless eye. There<br> was a heavy pistol openly in his trouser band and from the top of<br> his tattered boot protruded the hilt of a bowie knife.<br><br> He returned Scarlett's stare coldly and spat across the rail of the<br> banister before he spoke. There was contempt in his one eye, not a<br> personal contempt for her, but for her whole sex.<br><br> ‘Miz Wilkes sont me to work for you,’ he said shortly. He spoke<br> rustily, as one unaccustomed to speaking, the words coming slowly<br> and almost with difficulty. ‘M' name's Archie.’<br><br> ‘I'm sorry but I have no work for you, Mr. Archie.’<br><br> ‘Archie's m'fuss name.’<br><br> ‘I beg your pardon. What is your last name?’<br><br> He spat again. ‘I reckon that's my bizness,’ he said. ‘Archie'll<br> do.’<br><br> ‘I don't care what your last name is! I have nothing for you to<br> do.’<br><br> ‘I reckon you have. Miz Wilkes was upsot about yore wantin' to run<br> aroun' like a fool by yoreself and she sont me over here to drive<br> aroun' with you.’<br><br> ‘Indeed?’ cried Scarlett, indignant both at the man's rudeness and<br> Melly's meddling.<br><br> His one eye met hers with an impersonal animosity. ‘Yes. A<br> woman's got no bizness botherin' her men folks when they're tryin'<br> to take keer of her. If you're bound to gad about, I'll drive you.<br> I hates niggers--Yankees too.’<br><br> He shifted his wad of tobacco to the other cheek and, without<br> waiting for an invitation, sat down on the top step. ‘I ain't<br> sayin' I like drivin' women aroun', but Miz Wilkes been good to me,<br> lettin' me sleep in her cellar, and she sont me to drive you.’<br><br> ‘But--’ began Scarlett helplessly and then she stopped and looked<br> at him. After a moment she began to smile. She didn't like the<br> looks of this elderly desperado but his presence would simplify<br> matters. With him beside her, she could go to town, drive to the<br> mills, call on customers. No one could doubt her safety with him<br> and his very appearance was enough to keep from giving rise to<br> scandal.<br><br> ‘It's a bargain,’ she said. ‘That is, if my husband agrees.’<br><br> After a private conversation with Archie, Frank gave his reluctant<br> approval and sent word to the livery stable to release the horse<br> and buggy. He was hurt and disappointed that motherhood had not<br> changed Scarlett as he had hoped it would but, if she was<br> determined to go back to her damnable mills, then Archie was a<br> godsend.<br><br> So began the relationship that at first startled Atlanta. Archie<br> and Scarlett were a queerly assorted pair, the truculent dirty old<br> man with his wooden peg sticking stiffly out over the dashboard and<br> the pretty, neatly dressed young woman with forehead puckered in an<br> abstracted frown. They could be seen at all hours and at all<br> places in and near Atlanta, seldom speaking to each other,<br> obviously disliking each other, but bound together by mutual need,<br> he of money, she of protection. At least, said the ladies of the<br> town, it's better than riding around so brazenly with that Butler<br> man. They wondered curiously where Rhett was these days, for he<br> had abruptly left town three months before and no one, not even<br> Scarlett, knew where he was.<br><br> Archie was a silent man, never speaking unless spoken to and<br> usually answering with grunts. Every morning he came from<br> Melanie's cellar and sat on the front steps of Pitty's house,<br> chewing and spitting until Scarlett came out and Peter brought the<br> buggy from the stable. Uncle Peter feared him only a little less<br> than the devil or the Ku Klux and even Mammy walked silently and<br> timorously around him. He hated negroes and they knew it and<br> feared him. He reinforced his pistol and knife with another<br> pistol, and his fame spread far among the black population. He<br> never once had to draw a pistol or even lay his hand on his belt.<br> The moral effect was sufficient. No negro dared even laugh while<br> Archie was in hearing.<br><br> Once Scarlett asked him curiously why he hated negroes and was<br> surprised when he answered, for generally all questions were<br> answered by ‘I reckon that's my bizness.’<br><br> ‘I hates them, like all mountain folks hates them. We never liked<br> them and we never owned none. It was them niggers that started the<br> war. I hates them for that, too.’<br><br> ‘But you fought in the war.’<br><br> ‘I reckon that's a man's privilege. I hates Yankees too, more'n I<br> hates niggers. Most as much as I hates talkative women.’<br><br> It was such outspoken rudeness as this that threw Scarlett into<br> silent furies and made her long to be rid of him. But how could<br> she do without him? In what other way could she obtain such<br> freedom? He was rude and dirty and, occasionally, very odorous but<br> he served his purpose. He drove her to and from the mills and on<br> her round of customers, spitting and staring off into space while<br> she talked and gave orders. If she climbed down from the buggy, he<br> climbed after her and dogged her footsteps. When she was among<br> rough laborers, negroes or Yankee soldiers, he was seldom more than<br> a pace from her elbow.<br><br> Soon Atlanta became accustomed to seeing Scarlett and her bodyguard<br> and, from being accustomed, the ladies grew to envy her her freedom<br> of movement. Since the Ku Klux lynching, the ladies had been<br> practically immured, not even going to town to shop unless there<br> were half a dozen in their group. Naturally social minded, they<br> became restless and, putting their pride in their pockets, they<br> began to beg the loan of Archie from Scarlett. And whenever she<br> did not need him, she was gracious enough to spare him for the use<br> of other ladies.<br><br> Soon Archie became an Atlanta institution and the ladies competed<br> for his free time. There was seldom a morning when a child or a<br> negro servant did not arrive at breakfast time with a note saying:<br> ‘If you aren't using Archie this afternoon, do let me have him. I<br> want to drive to the cemetery with flowers.’ ‘I must go to the<br> milliners.’ ‘I should like Archie to drive Aunt Nelly for an<br> airing.’ ‘I must go calling on Peters Street and Grandpa is not<br> feeling well enough to take me. Could Archie--’<br><br> He drove them all, maids, matrons and widows, and toward all he<br> evidenced the same uncompromising contempt. It was obvious that he<br> did not like women, Melanie excepted, any better than he liked<br> negroes and Yankees. Shocked at first by his rudeness, the ladies<br> finally became accustomed to him and, as he was so silent, except<br> for intermittent explosions of tobacco juice, they took him as much<br> for granted as the horses he drove and forgot his very existence.<br> In fact, Mrs. Merriwether related to Mrs. Meade the complete<br> details of her niece's confinement before she even remembered<br> Archie's presence on the front seat of the carriage.<br><br> At no other time than this could such a situation have been<br> possible. Before the war, he would not have been permitted even in<br> the ladies' kitchens. They would have handed him food through the<br> back door and sent him about his business. But now they welcomed<br> his reassuring presence. Rude, illiterate, dirty, he was a bulwark<br> between the ladies and the terrors of Reconstruction. He was<br> neither friend nor servant. He was a hired bodyguard, protecting<br> the women while their men worked by day or were absent from home at<br> night.<br><br> It seemed to Scarlett that after Archie came to work for her Frank<br> was away at night very frequently. He said the books at the store<br> had to be balanced and business was brisk enough now to give him<br> little time to attend to this in working hours. And there were<br> sick friends with whom he had to sit. Then there was the<br> organization of Democrats who forgathered every Wednesday night to<br> devise ways of regaining the ballot and Frank never missed a<br> meeting. Scarlett thought this organization did little else except<br> argue the merits of General John B. Gordon over every other<br> general, except General Lee, and refight the war. Certainly she<br> could observe no progress in the direction of the recovery of the<br> ballot. But Frank evidently enjoyed the meetings for he stayed out<br> until all hours on those nights.<br><br> Ashley also sat up with the sick and he, too, attended the<br> Democratic meetings and he was usually away on the same nights as<br> Frank. On these nights, Archie escorted Pitty, Scarlett, Wade and<br> little Ella though the back yard to Melanie's house and the two<br> families spent the evenings together. The ladies sewed while<br> Archie lay full length on the parlor sofa snoring, his gray<br> whiskers fluttering at each rumble. No one had invited him to<br> dispose himself on the sofa and as it was the finest piece of<br> furniture in the house, the ladies secretly moaned every time he<br> lay down on it, planting his boot on the pretty upholstery. But<br> none of them had the courage to remonstrate with him. Especially<br> after he remarked that it was lucky he went to sleep easy, for<br> otherwise the sound of women clattering like a flock of guinea hens<br> would certainly drive him crazy.<br><br> Scarlett sometimes wondered where Archie had come from and what his<br> life had been before he came to live in Melly's cellar but she<br> asked no questions. There was that about his grim one-eyed face<br> which discouraged curiosity. All she knew was that his voice<br> bespoke the mountains to the north and that he had been in the army<br> and had lost both leg and eye shortly before the surrender. It was<br> words spoken in a fit of anger against Hugh Elsing which brought<br> out the truth of Archie's past.<br><br> One morning, the old man had driven her to Hugh's mill and she had<br> found it idle, the negroes gone and Hugh sitting despondently under<br> a tree. His crew had not made their appearance that morning and he<br> was at a loss as to what to do. Scarlett was in a furious temper<br> and did not scruple to expend it on Hugh, for she had just received<br> an order for a large amount of lumber--a rush order at that. She<br> had used energy and charm and bargaining to get that order and now<br> the mill was quiet.<br><br> ‘Drive me out to the other mill,’ she directed Archie. ‘Yes, I<br> know it'll take a long time and we won't get any dinner but what am<br> I paying you for? I'll have to make Mr. Wilkes stop what he's<br> doing and run me off this lumber. Like as not, his crew won't be<br> working either. Great balls of fire! I never saw such a<br> nincompoop as Hugh Elsing! I'm going to get rid of him just as<br> soon as that Johnnie Gallegher finishes the stores he's building.<br> What do I care if Gallegher was in the Yankee Army? He'll work. I<br> never saw a lazy Irishman yet. And I'm through with free issue<br> darkies. You just can't depend on them. I'm going to get Johnnie<br> Gallegher and lease me some convicts. He'll get work out of them.<br> He'll--’<br><br> Archie turned to her, his eye malevolent, and when he spoke there<br> was cold anger in his rusty voice.<br><br> ‘The day you gits convicts is the day I quits you,’ he said.<br><br> Scarlett was startled. ‘Good heavens! Why?’<br><br> ‘I knows about convict leasin'. I calls it convict murderin'.<br> Buyin' men like they was mules. Treatin' them worse than mules<br> ever was treated. Beatin' them, starvin' them, killin' them. And<br> who cares? The State don't care. It's got the lease money. The<br> folks that gits the convicts, they don't care. All they want is to<br> feed them cheap and git all the work they can out of them. Hell,<br> Ma'm. I never thought much of women and I think less of them now.’<br><br> ‘Is it any of your business?’<br><br> ‘I reckon,’ said Archie laconically and, after a pause, ‘I was a<br> convict for nigh on to forty years.’<br><br> Scarlett gasped, and, for a moment, shrank back against the<br> cushions. This then was the answer to the riddle of Archie, his<br> unwillingness to tell his last name or the place of his birth or<br> any scrap of his past life, the answer to the difficulty with which<br> he spoke and his cold hatred of the world. Forty years! He must<br> have gone into prison a young man. Forty years! Why--he must have<br> been a life prisoner and lifers were--<br><br> ‘Was it--murder?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ answered Archie briefly, as he flapped the reins. ‘M'<br> wife.’<br><br> Scarlett's eyelids batted rapidly with fright.<br><br> The mouth beneath the beard seemed to move, as if he were smiling<br> grimly at her fear. ‘I ain't goin' to kill you, Ma'm, if that's<br> what's frettin' you. Thar ain't but one reason for killin' a<br> woman.’<br><br> ‘You killed your wife!’<br><br> ‘She was layin' with my brother. He got away. I ain't sorry none<br> that I kilt her. Loose women ought to be kilt. The law ain't got<br> no right to put a man in jail for that but I was sont.’<br><br> ‘But--how did you get out? Did you escape? Were you pardoned?’<br><br> ‘You might call it a pardon.’ His thick gray brows writhed<br> together as though the effort of stringing words together was<br> difficult.<br><br> ‘'Long in 'sixty-four when Sherman come through, I was at<br> Milledgeville jail, like I had been for forty years. And the<br> warden he called all us prisoners together and he says the Yankees<br> are a-comin' a-burnin' and a-killin'. Now if thar's one thing I<br> hates worse than a nigger or a woman, it's a Yankee.’<br><br> ‘Why? Had you-- Did you ever know any Yankees?’<br><br> ‘No'm. But I'd hearn tell of them. I'd hearn tell they couldn't<br> never mind their own bizness. I hates folks who can't mind their<br> own bizness. What was they doin' in Georgia, freein' our niggers<br> and burnin' our houses and killin' our stock? Well, the warden he<br> said the army needed more soldiers bad, and any of us who'd jine up<br> would be free at the end of the war--if we come out alive. But us<br> lifers--us murderers, the warden he said the army didn't want us.<br> We was to be sont somewheres else to another jail. But I said to<br> the warden I ain't like most lifers. I'm just in for killin' my<br> wife and she needed killin'. And I wants to fight the Yankees.<br> And the warden he saw my side of it and he slipped me out with the<br> other prisoners.’<br><br> He paused and grunted.<br><br> ‘Huh. That was right funny. They put me in jail for killin' and<br> they let me out with a gun in my hand and a free pardon to do more<br> killin'. It shore was good to be a free man with a rifle in my<br> hand again. Us men from Milledgeville did good fightin' and<br> killin'--and a lot of us was kilt. I never knowed one who<br> deserted. And when the surrender come, we was free. I lost this<br> here leg and this here eye. But I ain't sorry.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ said Scarlett, weakly.<br><br> She tried to remember what she had heard about the releasing of the<br> Milledgeville convicts in that last desperate effort to stem the<br> tide of Sherman's army. Frank had mentioned it that Christmas of<br> 1864. What had he said? But her memories of that time were too<br> chaotic. Again she felt the wild terror of those days, heard the<br> siege guns, saw the line of wagons dripping blood into the red<br> roads, saw the Home Guard marching off, the little cadets and the<br> children like Phil Meade and the old men like Uncle Henry and<br> Grandpa Merriwether. And the convicts had marched out too, to die<br> in the twilight of the Confederacy, to freeze in the snow and sleet<br> of that last campaign in Tennessee.<br><br> For a brief moment she thought what a fool this old man was, to<br> fight for a state which had taken forty years from his life.<br> Georgia had taken his youth and his middle years for a crime that<br> was no crime to him, yet he had freely given a leg and an eye to<br> Georgia. The bitter words Rhett had spoken in the early days of<br> the war came back to her, and she remembered him saying he would<br> never fight for a society that had made him an outcast. But when<br> the emergency had arisen he had gone off to fight for that same<br> society, even as Archie had done. It seemed to her that all<br> Southern men, high or low, were sentimental fools and cared less<br> for their hides than for words which had no meaning.<br><br> She looked at Archie's gnarled old hands, his two pistols and his<br> knife, and fear pricked her again. Were there other ex-convicts at<br> large, like Archie, murderers, desperadoes, thieves, pardoned for<br> their crimes, in the name of the Confederacy? Why, any stranger on<br> the street might be a murderer! If Frank ever learned the truth<br> about Archie, there would be the devil to pay. Or if Aunt Pitty--<br> but the shock would kill Pitty. And as for Melanie--Scarlett<br> almost wished she could tell Melanie the truth about Archie. It<br> would serve her right for picking up trash and foisting it off on<br> her friends and relatives.<br><br> ‘I'm--I'm glad you told me, Archie. I--I won't tell anyone. It<br> would be a great shock to Mrs. Wilkes and the other ladies if they<br> knew.’<br><br> ‘Huh. Miz Wilkes knows. I told her the night she fuss let me<br> sleep in her cellar. You don't think I'd let a nice lady like her<br> take me into her house not knowin'?’<br><br> ‘Saints preserve us!’ cried Scarlet, aghast.<br><br> Melanie knew this man was a murderer and a woman murderer at that<br> and she hadn't ejected him from her house. She had trusted her son<br> with him and her aunt and sister-in-law and all her friends. And<br> she, the most timid of females, had not been frightened to be alone<br> with him in her house.<br><br> ‘Miz Wilkes is right sensible, for a woman. She 'lowed that I was<br> all right. She 'lowed that a liar allus kept on lyin' and a thief<br> kept on stealin' but folks don't do more'n one murder in a<br> lifetime. And she reckoned as how anybody who'd fought for the<br> Confederacy had wiped out anything bad they'd done. Though I don't<br> hold that I done nothin' bad, killin' my wife. . . . Yes, Miz<br> Wilkes is right sensible, for a woman. . . . And I'm tellin' you,<br> the day you leases convicts is the day I quits you.’<br><br> Scarlett made no reply but she thought,<br><br> ‘The sooner you quit me the better it will suit me. A murderer!’<br><br> How could Melly have been so--so-- Well, there was no word for<br> Melanie's action in taking in this old ruffian and not telling her<br> friends he was a jailbird. So service in the army wiped out past<br> sins! Melanie had that mixed up with baptism! But then Melly was<br> utterly silly about the Confederacy, its veterans, and anything<br> pertaining to them. Scarlett silently damned the Yankees and added<br> another mark on her score against them. They were responsible for<br> a situation that forced a woman to keep a murderer at her side to<br> protect her.<br><br> <br><br> Driving home with Archie in the chill twilight, Scarlett saw a<br> clutter of saddle horses, buggies and wagons outside the Girl of<br> the Period Saloon. Ashley was sitting on his horse, a strained<br> alert look on his face; the Simmons boys were leaning from their<br> buggy, making emphatic gestures; Hugh Elsing, his lock of brown<br> hair falling in his eyes, was waving his hands. Grandpa<br> Merriwether's pie wagon was in the center of the tangle and, as she<br> came closer, Scarlett saw that Tommy Wellburn and Uncle Henry<br> Hamilton were crowded on the seat with him.<br><br> ‘I wish,’ thought Scarlett irritably, ‘that Uncle Henry wouldn't<br> ride home in that contraption. He ought to be ashamed to be seen<br> in it. It isn't as though he didn't have a horse of his own. He<br> just does it so he and Grandpa can go to the saloon together every<br> night.’<br><br> As she came abreast the crowd something of their tenseness reached<br> her, insensitive though she was, and made fear clutch at her heart.<br><br> ‘Oh!’ she thought. ‘I hope no one else has been raped! If the Ku<br> Klux lynch just one more darky the Yankees will wipe us out!’ And<br> she spoke to Archie. ‘Pull up. Something's wrong.’<br><br> ‘You ain't goin' to stop outside a saloon,’ said Archie.<br><br> ‘You heard me. Pull up. Good evening, everybody. Ashley--Uncle<br> Henry--is something wrong? You all look so--’<br><br> The crowd turned to her, tipping their hats and smiling, but there<br> was a driving excitement in their eyes.<br><br> ‘Something's right and something's wrong,’ barked Uncle Henry.<br> ‘Depends on how you look at it. The way I figure is the<br> legislature couldn't have done different.’<br><br> The legislature? thought Scarlett in relief. She had little<br> interest in the legislature, feeling that its doings could hardly<br> affect her. It was the prospect of the Yankee soldiers on a<br> rampage again that frightened her.<br><br> ‘What's the legislature been up to now?’<br><br> ‘They've flatly refused to ratify the amendment,’ said Grandpa<br> Merriwether and there was pride in his voice. ‘That'll show the<br> Yankees.’<br><br> ‘And there'll be hell to pay for it--I beg your pardon, Scarlett,’<br> said Ashley.<br><br> ‘Oh, the amendment?’ questioned Scarlett, trying to look intelligent.<br><br> Politics were beyond her and she seldom wasted time thinking about<br> them. There had been a Thirteenth Amendment ratified sometime<br> before or maybe it had been the Sixteenth Amendment but what<br> ratification meant she had no idea. Men were always getting<br> excited about such things. Something of her lack of comprehension<br> showed in her face and Ashley smiled.<br><br> ‘It's the amendment letting the darkies vote, you know,’ he<br> explained. ‘It was submitted to the legislature and they refused<br> to ratify it.’<br><br> ‘How silly of them! You know the Yankees are going to force it<br> down our throats!’<br><br> ‘That's what I meant by saying there'd be hell to pay,’ said<br> Ashley.<br><br> ‘I'm proud of the legislature, proud of their gumption!’ shouted<br> Uncle Henry. ‘The Yankees can't force it down our throats if we<br> won't have it.’<br><br> ‘They can and they will.’ Ashley's voice was calm but there was<br> worry in his eyes. ‘And it'll make things just that much harder<br> for us.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, surely not! Things couldn't be any harder than they<br> are now!’<br><br> ‘Yes, things can get worse, even worse than they are now. Suppose<br> we have a darky legislature? A darky governor? Suppose we have a<br> worse military rule than we now have?’<br><br> Scarlett's eyes grew large with fear as some understanding entered<br> her mind.<br><br> ‘I've been trying to think what would be best for Georgia, best for<br> all of us.’ Ashley's face was drawn. ‘Whether it's wisest to<br> fight this thing like the legislature has done, rouse the North<br> against us and bring the whole Yankee Army on us to cram the darky<br> vote down us, whether we want it or not. Or--swallow our pride as<br> best we can, submit gracefully and get the whole matter over with<br> as easily as possible. It will amount to the same thing in the<br> end. We're helpless. We've got to take the dose they're<br> determined to give us. Maybe it would be better for us to take it<br> without kicking.’<br><br> Scarlett hardly heard his words, certainly their full import went<br> over her head. She knew that Ashley, as usual, was seeing both<br> sides of a question. She was seeing only one side--how this slap<br> in the Yankees' faces might affect her.<br><br> ‘Going to turn Radical and vote the Republican ticket, Ashley?’<br> jeered Grandpa Merriwether harshly.<br><br> There was a tense silence. Scarlett saw Archie's hand make a swift<br> move toward his pistol and then stop. Archie thought, and<br> frequently said, that Grandpa was an old bag of wind and Archie had<br> no intention of letting him insult Miss Melanie's husband, even if<br> Miss Melanie's husband was talking like a fool.<br><br> The perplexity vanished suddenly from Ashley's eyes and hot anger<br> flared. But before he could speak, Uncle Henry charged Grandpa.<br><br> ‘You God--you blast--I beg your pardon, Scarlett--Grandpa, you<br> jackass, don't you say that to Ashley!’<br><br> ‘Ashley can take care of himself without you defending him,’ said<br> Grandpa coldly. ‘And he is talking like a Scallawag. Submit,<br> hell! I beg your pardon, Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘I didn't believe in secession,’ said Ashley and his voice shook<br> with anger. ‘But when Georgia seceded, I went with her. And I<br> didn't believe in war but I fought in the war. And I don't believe<br> in making the Yankees madder than they already are. But if the<br> legislature has decided to do it, I'll stand by the legislature.<br> I--’<br><br> ‘Archie,’ said Uncle Henry abruptly, ‘drive Miss Scarlett on home.<br> This isn't any place for her. Politics aren't for women folks<br> anyway, and there's going to be cussing in a minute. Go on,<br> Archie. Good night, Scarlett.’<br><br> As they drove off down Peachtree Street, Scarlett's heart was<br> beating fast with fear. Would this foolish action of the<br> legislature have any effect on her safety? Would it so enrage the<br> Yankees that she might lose her mills?<br><br> ‘Well, sir,’ rumbled Archie, ‘I've hearn tell of rabbits spittin'<br> in bulldogs' faces but I ain't never seen it till now. Them<br> legislatures might just as well have hollered 'Hurray for Jeff<br> Davis and the Southern Confederacy' for all the good it'll do them--<br> and us. Them nigger-lovin' Yankees have made up their mind to<br> make the niggers our bosses. But you got to admire them<br> legislatures' sperrit!’<br><br> ‘Admire them? Great balls of fire! Admire them? They ought to be<br> shot! It'll bring the Yankees down on us like a duck on a June<br> bug. Why couldn't they have rati--radi--whatever they were<br> supposed to do to it and smoothed the Yankees down instead of<br> stirring them up again? They're going to make us knuckle under and<br> we may as well knuckle now as later.’<br><br> Archie fixed her with a cold eye.<br><br> ‘Knuckle under without a fight? Women ain't got no more pride than<br> goats.’<br><br> <br><br> When Scarlett leased ten convicts, five for each of her mills,<br> Archie made good his threat and refused to have anything further to<br> do with her. Not all Melanie's pleading or Frank's promises of<br> higher pay would induce him to take up the reins again. He<br> willingly escorted Melanie and Pitty and India and their friends<br> about the town but not Scarlett. He would not even drive for the<br> other ladies if Scarlett was in the carriage. It was an<br> embarrassing situation, having the old desperado sitting in<br> judgment upon her, and it was still more embarrassing to know that<br> her family and friends agreed with the old man.<br><br> Frank pleaded with her against taking the step. Ashley at first<br> refused to work convicts and was persuaded, against his will, only<br> after tears and supplications and promises that when times were<br> better she would hire free darkies. Neighbors were so outspoken in<br> their disapproval that Frank, Pitty and Melanie found it hard to<br> hold up their heads. Even Peter and Mammy declared that it was bad<br> luck to work convicts and no good would come of it. Everyone said<br> it was wrong to take advantage of the miseries and misfortunes of<br> others.<br><br> ‘You didn't have any objections to working slaves!’ Scarlett cried<br> indignantly.<br><br> Ah, but that was different. Slaves were neither miserable nor<br> unfortunate. The negroes were far better off under slavery than<br> they were now under freedom, and if she didn't believe it, just<br> look about her! But, as usual, opposition had the effect of making<br> Scarlett more determined on her course. She removed Hugh from the<br> management of the mill, put him to driving a lumber wagon and<br> closed the final details of hiring Johnnie Gallegher.<br><br> He seemed to be the only person she knew who approved of the<br> convicts. He nodded his bullet head briefly and said it was a<br> smart move. Scarlett, looking at the little ex-jockey, planted<br> firmly on his short bowed legs, his gnomish face hard and<br> businesslike, thought: ‘Whoever let him ride their horses didn't<br> care much for horse flesh. I wouldn't let him get within ten feet<br> of any horse of mine.’<br><br> But she had no qualms in trusting him with a convict gang.<br><br> ‘And I'm to have a free hand with the gang?’ he questioned, his<br> eyes as cold as gray agates.<br><br> ‘A free hand. All I ask is that you keep that mill running and<br> deliver my lumber when I want it and as much as I want.’<br><br> ‘I'm your man,’ said Johnnie shortly. ‘I'll tell Mr. Wellburn I'm<br> leaving him.’<br><br> As he rolled off through the crowd of masons and carpenters and hod<br> carriers Scarlett felt relieved and her spirits rose. Johnnie was<br> indeed her man. He was tough and hard and there was no nonsense<br> about him. ‘Shanty Irish on the make,’ Frank had contemptuously<br> called him, but for that very reason Scarlett valued him. She knew<br> that an Irishman with a determination to get somewhere was a<br> valuable man to have, regardless of what his personal characteristics<br> might be. And she felt a closer kinship with him than with many men<br> of her own class, for Johnnie knew the value of money.<br><br> The first week he took over the mill he justified all her hopes,<br> for he accomplished more with five convicts than Hugh had ever done<br> with his crew of ten free negroes. More than that, he gave<br> Scarlett greater leisure than she had had since she came to Atlanta<br> the year before, because he had no liking for her presence at the<br> mill and said so frankly.<br><br> ‘You tend to your end of selling and let me tend to my end of<br> lumbering,’ he said shortly. ‘A convict camp ain't any place for a<br> lady and if nobody else'll tell you so, Johnnie Gallegher's telling<br> you now. I'm delivering your lumber, ain't I? Well, I've got no<br> notion to be pestered every day like Mr. Wilkes. He needs<br> pestering. I don't.’<br><br> So Scarlett reluctantly stayed away from Johnnie's mill, fearing<br> that if she came too often he might quit and that would be ruinous.<br> His remark that Ashley needed pestering stung her, for there was<br> more truth in it than she liked to admit. Ashley was doing little<br> better with convicts than he had done with free labor, although<br> why, he was unable to tell. Moreover, he looked as if he were<br> ashamed to be working convicts and he had little to say to her<br> these days.<br><br> Scarlett was worried by the change that was coming over him. There<br> were gray hairs in his bright head now and a tired slump in his<br> shoulders. And he seldom smiled. He no longer looked the<br> debonaire Ashley who had caught her fancy so many years before. He<br> looked like a man secretly gnawed by a scarcely endurable pain and<br> there was a grim tight look about his mouth that baffled and hurt<br> her. She wanted to drag his head fiercely down on her shoulder,<br> stroke the graying hair and cry: ‘Tell me what's worrying you!<br> I'll fix it! I'll make it right for you!’<br><br> But his formal, remote air kept her at arm's length.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLIII<br><br> <br> It was one of those rare December days when the sun was almost as<br> warm as Indian summer. Dry red leaves still clung to the oak in<br> Aunt Pitty's yard and a faint yellow green still persisted in the<br> dying grass. Scarlett, with the baby in her arms, stepped out onto<br> the side porch and sat down in a rocking chair in a patch of<br> sunshine. She was wearing a new green challis dress trimmed with<br> yards and yards of black rickrack braid and a new lace house cap<br> which Aunt Pitty had made for her. Both were very becoming to her<br> and she knew it and took great pleasure in them. How good it was<br> to look pretty again after the long months of looking so dreadful!<br><br> As she sat rocking the baby and humming to herself, she heard the<br> sound of hooves coming up the side street and, peering curiously<br> through the tangle of dead vines on the porch, she saw Rhett Butler<br> riding toward the house.<br><br> He had been away from Atlanta for months, since just after Gerald<br> died, since long before Ella Lorena was born. She had missed him<br> but she now wished ardently that there was some way to avoid seeing<br> him. In fact, the sight of his dark face brought a feeling of<br> guilty panic to her breast. A matter in which Ashley was concerned<br> lay on her conscience and she did not wish to discuss it with<br> Rhett, but she knew he would force the discussion, no matter how<br> disinclined she might be.<br><br> He drew up at the gate and swung lightly to the ground and she<br> thought, staring nervously at him, that he looked just like an<br> illustration in a book Wade was always pestering her to read aloud.<br><br> ‘All he needs is earrings and a cutlass between his teeth,’ she<br> thought. ‘Well, pirate or no, he's not going to cut my throat<br> today if I can help it.’<br><br> As he came up the walk she called a greeting to him, summoning her<br> sweetest smile. How lucky that she had on her new dress and the<br> becoming cap and looked so pretty! As his eyes went swiftly over<br> her, she knew he thought her pretty, too.<br><br> ‘A new baby! Why, Scarlett, this is a surprise!’ he laughed,<br> leaning down to push the blanket away from Ella Lorena's small ugly<br> face.<br><br> ‘Don't be silly,’ she said, blushing. ‘How are you, Rhett? You've<br> been away a long time.’<br><br> ‘So I have. Let me hold the baby, Scarlett. Oh, I know how to<br> hold babies. I have many strange accomplishments. Well, he<br> certainly looks like Frank. All except the whiskers, but give him<br> time.’<br><br> ‘I hope not. It's a girl.’<br><br> ‘A girl? That's better still. Boys are such nuisances. Don't<br> ever have any more boys, Scarlett.’<br><br> It was on the tip of her tongue to reply tartly that she never<br> intended to have any more babies, boys or girls, but she caught<br> herself in time and smiled, casting about quickly in her mind for<br> some topic of conversation that would put off the bad moment when<br> the subject she feared would come up for discussion.<br><br> ‘Did you have a nice trip, Rhett? Where did you go this time?’<br><br> ‘Oh--Cuba--New Orleans--other places. Here, Scarlett, take the<br> baby. She's beginning to slobber and I can't get to my<br> handkerchief. She's a fine baby, I'm sure, but she's wetting my<br> shirt bosom.’<br><br> She took the child back into her lap and Rhett settled himself<br> lazily on the banister and took a cigar from a silver case.<br><br> ‘You are always going to New Orleans,’ she said and pouted a<br> little. ‘And you never will tell me what you do there.’<br><br> ‘I am a hard-working man, Scarlett, and perhaps my business takes<br> me there.’<br><br> ‘Hard-working! You!’ she laughed impertinently. ‘You never worked<br> in your life. You're too lazy. All you ever do is finance<br> Carpetbaggers in their thieving and take half the profits and bribe<br> Yankee officials to let you in on schemes to rob us taxpayers.’<br><br> He threw back his head and laughed.<br><br> ‘And how you would love to have money enough to bribe officials, so<br> you could do likewise!’<br><br> ‘The very idea--’ She began to ruffle.<br><br> ‘But perhaps you will make enough money to get into bribery on a<br> large scale some day. Maybe you'll get rich off those convicts you<br> leased.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she said, a little disconcerted, ‘how did you find out about<br> my gang so soon?’<br><br> ‘I arrived last night and spent the evening in the Girl of the<br> Period Saloon, where one hears all the news of the town. It's a<br> clearing house for gossip. Better than a ladies' sewing circle.<br> Everyone told me that you'd leased a gang and put that little plug-<br> ugly, Gallegher, in charge to work them to death.’<br><br> ‘That's a lie,’ she said angrily. ‘He won't work them to death.<br> I'll see to that.’<br><br> ‘Will you?’<br><br> ‘Of course I will! How can you even insinuate such things?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I do beg your pardon, Mrs. Kennedy! I know your motives are<br> always above reproach. However, Johnnie Gallegher is a cold little<br> bully if I ever saw one. Better watch him or you'll be having<br> trouble when the inspector comes around.’<br><br> ‘You tend to your business and I'll tend to mine,’ she said<br> indignantly. ‘And I don't want to talk about convicts any more.<br> Everybody's been hateful about them. My gang is my own business--<br> And you haven't told me yet what you do in New Orleans. You go<br> there so often that everybody says--’ She paused. She had not<br> intended to say so much.<br><br> ‘What do they say?’<br><br> ‘Well--that you have a sweetheart there. That you are going to get<br> married. Are you, Rhett?’<br><br> She had been curious about this for so long that she could not<br> refrain from asking the point-blank question. A queer little pang<br> of jealousy jabbed at her at the thought of Rhett getting married,<br> although why that should be she did not know.<br><br> His bland eyes grew suddenly alert and he caught her gaze and held<br> it until a little blush crept up into her cheeks.<br><br> ‘Would it matter much to you?’<br><br> ‘Well, I should hate to lose your friendship,’ she said primly and,<br> with an attempt at disinterestedness, bent down to pull the blanket<br> closer about Ella Lorena's head.<br><br> He laughed suddenly, shortly, and said: ‘Look at me, Scarlett.’<br><br> She looked up unwillingly, her blush deepening.<br><br> ‘You can tell your curious friends that when I marry it will be<br> because I couldn't get the woman I wanted in any other way. And<br> I've never yet wanted a woman bad enough to marry her.’<br><br> Now she was indeed confused and embarrassed, for she remembered the<br> night on this very porch during the siege when he had said: ‘I am<br> not a marrying man’ and casually suggested that she become his<br> mistress--remembered, too, the terrible day when he was in jail and<br> was shamed by the memory. A slow malicious smile went over his<br> face as he read her eyes.<br><br> ‘But I will satisfy your vulgar curiosity since you ask such<br> pointed questions. It isn't a sweetheart that takes me to New<br> Orleans. It's a child, a little boy.’<br><br> ‘A little boy!’ The shock of this unexpected information wiped out<br> her confusion.<br><br> ‘Yes, he is my legal ward and I am responsible for him. He's in<br> school in New Orleans. I go there frequently to see him.’<br><br> ‘And take him presents?’ So, she thought, that's how he always<br> knows what kind of presents Wade likes!<br><br> ‘Yes,’ he said shortly, unwillingly.<br><br> ‘Well, I never! Is he handsome?’<br><br> ‘Too handsome for his own good.’<br><br> ‘Is he a nice little boy?’<br><br> ‘No. He's a perfect hellion. I wish he had never been born. Boys<br> are troublesome creatures. Is there anything else you'd like to<br> know?’<br><br> He looked suddenly angry and his brow was dark, as though he<br> already regretted speaking of the matter at all.<br><br> ‘Well, not if you don't want to tell me any more,’ she said<br> loftily, though she was burning for further information. ‘But I<br> just can't see you in the role of a guardian,’ and she laughed,<br> hoping to disconcert him.<br><br> ‘No, I don't suppose you can. Your vision is pretty limited.’<br><br> He said no more and smoked his cigar in silence for a while. She<br> cast about for some remark as rude as his but could think of none.<br><br> ‘I would appreciate it if you'd say nothing of this to anyone,’ he<br> said finally. ‘Though I suppose that asking a woman to keep her<br> mouth shut is asking the impossible.’<br><br> ‘I can keep a secret,’ she said with injured dignity.<br><br> ‘Can you? It's nice to learn unsuspected things about friends.<br> Now, stop pouting, Scarlett. I'm sorry I was rude but you deserved<br> it for prying. Give me a smile and let's be pleasant for a minute<br> or two before I take up an unpleasant subject.’<br><br> Oh, dear! she thought. Now, he's going to talk about Ashley and<br> the mill! and she hastened to smile and show her dimple to divert<br> him. ‘Where else did you go, Rhett? You haven't been in New<br> Orleans all this time, have you?’<br><br> ‘No, for the last month I've been in Charleston. My father died.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I'm sorry.’<br><br> ‘Don't be. I'm sure he wasn't sorry to die, and I'm sure I'm not<br> sorry he's dead.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, what a dreadful thing to say!’<br><br> ‘It would be much more dreadful if I pretended to be sorry, when I<br> wasn't, wouldn't it? There was never any love lost between us. I<br> cannot remember when the old gentleman did not disapprove of me. I<br> was too much like his own father and he disapproved heartily of his<br> father. And as I grew older his disapproval of me became downright<br> dislike, which, I admit, I did little to change. All the things<br> Father wanted me to do and be were such boring things. And finally<br> he threw me out into the world without a cent and no training<br> whatsoever to be anything but a Charleston gentleman, a good pistol<br> shot and an excellent poker player. And he seemed to take it as a<br> personal affront that I did not starve but put my poker playing to<br> excellent advantage and supported myself royally by gambling. He<br> was so affronted at a Butler becoming a gambler that when I came<br> home for the first time, he forbade my mother to see me. And all<br> during the war when I was blockading out of Charleston, Mother had<br> to lie and slip off to see me. Naturally that didn't increase my<br> love for him.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I didn't know all that!’<br><br> ‘He was what is pointed out as a fine old gentleman of the old<br> school which means that he was ignorant, thick headed, intolerant<br> and incapable of thinking along any lines except what other<br> gentlemen of the old school thought. Everyone admired him<br> tremendously for having cut me off and counted me as dead. 'If thy<br> right eye offend thee, pluck it out.' I was his right eye, his<br> oldest son, and he plucked me out with a vengeance.’<br><br> He smiled a little, his eyes hard with amused memory.<br><br> ‘Well, I could forgive all that but I can't forgive what he's done<br> to Mother and my sister since the war ended. They've been<br> practically destitute. The plantation house was burned and the<br> rice fields have gone back to marsh lands. And the town house went<br> for taxes and they've been living in two rooms that aren't fit for<br> darkies. I've sent money to Mother, but Father has sent it back--<br> tainted money, you see!--and several times I've gone to Charleston<br> and given money, on the sly, to my sister. But Father always found<br> out and raised merry hell with her, till her life wasn't worth<br> living, poor girl. And back the money came to me. I don't know<br> how they've lived. . . . Yes, I do know. My brother's given what<br> he could, though he hasn't much to give and he won't take anything<br> from me either--speculator's money is unlucky money, you see! And<br> the charity of their friends. Your Aunt Eulalie, she's been very<br> kind. She's one of Mother's best friends, you know. She's given<br> them clothes and-- Good God! My mother on charity!’<br><br> It was one of the few times she had ever seen him with his mask<br> off, his face hard with honest hatred for his father and distress<br> for his mother.<br><br> ‘Aunt 'Lalie! But, good Heavens, Rhett, she hasn't got anything<br> much above what I send her!’<br><br> ‘Ah, so that's where it comes from! How ill bred of you, my dear,<br> to brag of such a thing in the face of my humiliation. You must<br> let me reimburse you!’<br><br> ‘With pleasure,’ said Scarlett, her mouth suddenly twisting into a<br> grin, and he smiled back.<br><br> ‘Ah, Scarlett, how the thought of a dollar does make your eyes<br> sparkle! Are you sure you haven't some Scotch or perhaps Jewish<br> blood as well as Irish?’<br><br> ‘Don't be hateful! I didn't mean to throw it in your face about<br> Aunt 'Lalie. But honestly, she thinks I'm made of money. She's<br> always writing me for more and, God knows, I've got enough on my<br> hands without supporting all of Charleston. What did your father<br> die of?’<br><br> ‘Genteel starvation, I think--and hope. It served him right. He<br> was willing to let Mother and Rosemary starve with him. Now that<br> he's dead, I can help them. I've bought them a house on the<br> Battery and they've servants to look after them. But of course,<br> they couldn't let it be known that the money came from me.’<br><br> ‘Why not?’<br><br> ‘My dear, surely you know Charleston! You've visited there. My<br> family may be poor but they have a position to uphold. And they<br> couldn't uphold it if it were known that gambling money and<br> speculator's money and Carpetbag money was behind it. No, they<br> gave it out that Father left an enormous life insurance--that he'd<br> beggared himself and starved himself to death to keep up the<br> payments, so that after he died, they'd be provided for. So he is<br> looked upon as an even greater gentleman of the old school than<br> before. . . . In fact, a martyr to his family. I hope he's<br> turning in his grave at the knowledge that Mother and Rosemary are<br> comfortable now, in spite of his efforts. . . . In a way, I'm<br> sorry he's dead because he wanted to die--was so glad to die.’<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘Oh, he really died when Lee surrendered. You know the type. He<br> never could adjust himself to the new times and spent his time<br> talking about the good old days.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, are all old folks like that?’ She was thinking of Gerald<br> and what Will had said about him.<br><br> ‘Heavens, no! Just look at your Uncle Henry and that old wild cat,<br> Mr. Merriwether, just to name two. They took a new lease on life<br> when they marched out with the Home Guard and it seems to me that<br> they've gotten younger and more peppery ever since. I met old man<br> Merriwether this morning driving Rene's pie wagon and cursing the<br> horse like an army mule skinner. He told me he felt ten years<br> younger since he escaped from the house and his daughter-in-law's<br> coddling and took to driving the wagon. And your Uncle Henry<br> enjoys fighting the Yankees in court and out and defending the<br> widow and the orphan--free of charge, I fear--against the<br> Carpetbaggers. If there hadn't been a war, he'd have retired long<br> ago and nursed his rheumatism. They're young again because they<br> are of use again and feel that they are needed. And they like this<br> new day that gives old men another chance. But there are plenty of<br> people, young people, who feel like my father and your father.<br> They can't and won't adjust and that brings me to the unpleasant<br> subject I want to discuss with you, Scarlett.’<br><br> His sudden shift so disconcerted her that she stammered: ‘What--<br> what--’ and inwardly groaned: ‘Oh, Lord! Now, it's coming. I<br> wonder if I can butter him down?’<br><br> ‘I shouldn't have expected either truth or honor or fair dealing<br> from you, knowing you as I do. But foolishly, I trusted you.’<br><br> ‘I don't know what you mean.’<br><br> ‘I think you do. At any rate, you look very guilty. As I was<br> riding along Ivy Street a while ago, on my way to call on you, who<br> should hail me from behind a hedge but Mrs. Ashley Wilkes! Of<br> course, I stopped and chatted with her.’<br><br> ‘Indeed?’<br><br> ‘Yes, we had an enjoyable talk. She told me she had always wanted<br> to let me know how brave she thought I was to have struck a blow<br> for the Confederacy, even at the eleventh hour.’<br><br> ‘Oh, fiddle-dee-dee! Melly's a fool. She might have died that<br> night because you acted so heroic.’<br><br> ‘I imagine she would have thought her life given in a good cause.<br> And when I asked her what she was doing in Atlanta she looked quite<br> surprised at my ignorance and told me that they were living here<br> now and that you had been kind enough to make Mr. Wilkes a partner<br> in your mill.’<br><br> ‘Well, what of it?’ questioned Scarlett, shortly.<br><br> ‘When I lent you the money to buy that mill I made one stipulation,<br> to which you agreed, and that was that it should not go to the<br> support of Ashley Wilkes.’<br><br> ‘You are being very offensive. I've paid you back your money and I<br> own the mill and what I do with it is my own business.’<br><br> ‘Would you mind telling me how you made the money to pay back my<br> loan?’<br><br> ‘I made it selling lumber, of course.’<br><br> ‘You made it with the money I lent you to give you your start.<br> That's what you mean. My money is being used to support Ashley.<br> You are a woman quite without honor and if you hadn't repaid my<br> loan, I'd take great pleasure in calling it in now and selling you<br> out at public auction if you couldn't pay.’<br><br> He spoke lightly but there was anger flickering in his eyes.<br><br> Scarlett hastily carried the warfare into the enemy's territory.<br><br> ‘Why do you hate Ashley so much? I believe you're jealous of him.’<br><br> After she had spoken she could have bitten her tongue, for he threw<br> back his head and laughed until she went red with mortification.<br><br> ‘Add conceit to dishonor,’ he said. ‘You'll never get over being<br> the belle of the County, will you? You'll always think you're the<br> cutest little trick in shoe leather and that every man you meet is<br> expiring for love of you.’<br><br> ‘I don't either!’ she cried hotly. ‘But I just can't see why you<br> hate Ashley so much and that's the only explanation I can think<br> of.’<br><br> ‘Well, think something else, pretty charmer, for that's the wrong<br> explanation. And as for hating Ashley--I don't hate him any more<br> than I like him. In fact, my only emotion toward him and his kind<br> is pity.’<br><br> ‘Pity?’<br><br> ‘Yes, and a little contempt. Now, swell up like a gobbler and tell<br> me that he is worth a thousand blackguards like me and that I<br> shouldn't dare to be so presumptuous as to feel either pity or<br> contempt for him. And when you have finished swelling, I'll tell<br> you what I mean, if you're interested.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'm not.’<br><br> ‘I shall tell you, just the same, for I can't bear for you to go on<br> nursing your pleasant delusion of my jealousy. I pity him because<br> he ought to be dead and he isn't. And I have a contempt for him<br> because he doesn't know what to do with himself now that his world<br> is gone.’<br><br> There was something familiar in the idea he expressed. She had a<br> confused memory of having heard similar words but she could not<br> remember when and where. She did not think very hard about it for<br> her anger was hot.<br><br> ‘If you had your way all the decent men in the South would be<br> dead!’<br><br> ‘And if they had their way, I think Ashley's kind would prefer to<br> be dead. Dead with neat stones above them, saying: 'Here lies a<br> soldier of the Confederacy, dead for the Southland' or 'Dulce et<br> decorum est--' or any of the other popular epitaphs.’<br><br> ‘I don't see why!’<br><br> ‘You never see anything that isn't written in letters a foot high<br> and then shoved under your nose, do you? If they were dead, their<br> troubles would be over, there'd be no problems to face, problems<br> that have no solutions. Moreover, their families would be proud of<br> them through countless generations. And I've heard the dead are<br> happy. Do you suppose Ashley Wilkes is happy?’<br><br> ‘Why, of course--’ she began and then she remembered the look in<br> Ashley's eyes recently and stopped.<br><br> ‘Is he happy or Hugh Elsing or Dr. Meade? Any more than my father<br> and your father were happy?’<br><br> ‘Well, perhaps not as happy as they might be, because they've all<br> lost their money.’<br><br> He laughed.<br><br> ‘It isn't losing their money, my pet. I tell you it's losing their<br> world--the world they were raised in. They're like fish out of<br> water or cats with wings. They were raised to be certain persons,<br> to do certain things, to occupy certain niches. And those persons<br> and things and niches disappeared forever when General Lee arrived<br> at Appomattox. Oh, Scarlett, don't look so stupid! What is there<br> for Ashley Wilkes to do, now that his home is gone and his<br> plantation taken up for taxes and fine gentlemen are going twenty<br> for a penny? Can he work with his head or his hands? I'll bet<br> you've lost money hand over fist since he took over that mill.’<br><br> ‘I have not!’<br><br> ‘How nice. May I look over your books some Sunday evening when you<br> are at leisure?’<br><br> ‘You can go to the devil and not at your leisure. You can go now,<br> for all I care.’<br><br> ‘My pet, I've been to the devil and he's a very dull fellow. I<br> won't go there again, even for you. . . . You took my money when<br> you needed it desperately and you used it. We had an agreement as<br> to how it should be used and you have broken that agreement. Just<br> remember, my precious little cheat, the time will come when you<br> will want to borrow more money from me. You'll want me to bank<br> you, at some incredibly low interest, so you can buy more mills and<br> more mules and build more saloons. And you can whistle for the<br> money.’<br><br> ‘When I need money I'll borrow it from the bank, thank you,’ she<br> said coldly, but her breast was heaving with rage.<br><br> ‘Will you? Try to do it. I own plenty of stock in the bank.’<br><br> ‘You do?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I am interested in some honest enterprises.’<br><br> ‘There are other banks--’<br><br> ‘Plenty of them. And if I can manage it, you'll play hell getting<br> a cent from any of them. You can go to the Carpetbag usurers if<br> you want money.’<br><br> ‘I'll go to them with pleasure.’<br><br> ‘You'll go but with little pleasure when you learn their rates of<br> interest. My pretty, there are penalties in the business world for<br> crooked dealing. You should have played straight with me.’<br><br> ‘You're a fine man, aren't you? So rich and powerful yet picking<br> on people who are down, like Ashley and me!’<br><br> ‘Don't put yourself in his class. You aren't down. Nothing will<br> down you. But he is down and he'll stay there unless there's some<br> energetic person behind him, guiding and protecting him as long as<br> he lives. I'm of no mind to have my money used for the benefit of<br> such a person.’<br><br> ‘You didn't mind helping me and I was down and--’<br><br> ‘You were a good risk, my dear, an interesting risk. Why? Because<br> you didn't plump yourself down on your male relatives and sob for<br> the old days. You got out and hustled and now your fortunes are<br> firmly planted on money stolen from a dead man's wallet and money<br> stolen from the Confederacy. You've got murder to your credit, and<br> husband stealing, attempted fornication, lying and sharp dealing<br> and any amount of chicanery that won't bear close inspection.<br> Admirable things, all of them. They show you to be a person of<br> energy and determination and a good money risk. It's entertaining,<br> helping people who help themselves. I'd lend ten thousand dollars<br> without even a note to that old Roman matron, Mrs. Merriwether.<br> She started with a basket of pies and look at her now! A bakery<br> employing half a dozen people, old Grandpa happy with his delivery<br> wagon and that lazy little Creole, Rene, working hard and liking<br> it. . . . Or that poor devil, Tommy Wellburn, who does two men's<br> work with half a man's body and does it well or--well, I won't go<br> on and bore you.’<br><br> ‘You do bore me. You bore me to distraction,’ said Scarlett<br> coldly, hoping to annoy him and divert him from the ever-<br> unfortunate subject of Ashley. But he only laughed shortly and<br> refused to take up the gauntlet.<br><br> ‘People like them are worth helping. But Ashley Wilkes--bah! His<br> breed is of no use or value in an upside-down world like ours.<br> Whenever the world up-ends, his kind is the first to perish. And<br> why not? They don't deserve to survive because they won't fight--<br> don't know how to fight. This isn't the first time the world's<br> been upside down and it won't be the last. It's happened before<br> and it'll happen again. And when it does happen, everyone loses<br> everything and everyone is equal. And then they all start again at<br> taw, with nothing at all. That is, nothing except the cunning of<br> their brains and strength of their hands. But some people, like<br> Ashley, have neither cunning nor strength or, having them, scruple<br> to use them. And so they go under and they should go under. It's<br> a natural law and the world is better off without them. But there<br> are always a hardy few who come through and given time, they are<br> right back where they were before the world turned over.’<br><br> ‘You've been poor! You just said that your father turned you out<br> without a penny!’ said Scarlett, furious. ‘I should think you'd<br> understand and sympathize with Ashley!’<br><br> ‘I do understand,’ said Rhett, ‘but I'm damned if I sympathize.<br> After the surrender Ashley had much more than I had when I was<br> thrown out. At least, he had friends who took him in, whereas I<br> was Ishmael. But what has Ashley done with himself?’<br><br> ‘If you are comparing him with yourself, you conceited thing, why--<br> He's not like you, thank God! He wouldn't soil his hands as you<br> do, making money with Carpetbaggers and Scallawags and Yankees.<br> He's scrupulous and honorable!’<br><br> ‘But not too scrupulous and honorable to take aid and money from a<br> woman.’<br><br> ‘What else could he have done?’<br><br> ‘Who am I to say? I only know what I did, both when I was thrown<br> out and nowadays. I only know what other men have done. We saw<br> opportunity in the ruin of a civilization and we made the most of<br> our opportunity, some honestly, some shadily, and we are still<br> making the most of it. But the Ashleys of this world have the same<br> chances and don't take them. They just aren't smart, Scarlett, and<br> only the smart deserve to survive.’<br><br> She hardly heard what he was saying, for now there was coming back<br> to her the exact memory which had teased her a few minutes before<br> when he first began speaking. She remembered the cold wind that<br> swept the orchard of Tara and Ashley standing by a pile of rails,<br> his eyes looking beyond her. And he had said--what? Some funny<br> foreign name that sounded like profanity and had talked of the end<br> of the world. She had not known what he meant then but now<br> bewildered comprehension was coming to her and with it a sick,<br> weary feeling.<br><br> ‘Why, Ashley said--’<br><br> ‘Yes?’<br><br> ‘Once at Tara he said something about the--a--dusk of the gods and<br> about the end of the world and some such foolishness.’<br><br> ‘Ah, the Gotterdammerung!’ Rhett's eyes were sharp with interest.<br> ‘And what else?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I don't remember exactly. I wasn't paying much mind. But--<br> yes--something about the strong coming through and the weak being<br> winnowed out.’<br><br> ‘Ah, so he knows. Then that makes it harder for him. Most of them<br> don't know and will never know. They'll wonder all their lives<br> where the lost enchantment has vanished. They'll simply suffer in<br> proud and incompetent silence. But he understands. He knows he's<br> winnowed out.’<br><br> ‘Oh, he isn't! Not while I've got breath in my body.’<br><br> He looked at her quietly and his brown face was smooth.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, how did you manage to get his consent to come to Atlanta<br> and take over the mill? Did he struggle very hard against you?’<br><br> She had a quick memory of the scene with Ashley after Gerald's<br> funeral and put it from her.<br><br> ‘Why, of course not,’ she replied indignantly. ‘When I explained<br> to him that I needed his help because I didn't trust that scamp who<br> was running the mill and Frank was too busy to help me and I was<br> going to--well, there was Ella Lorena, you see. He was very glad<br> to help me out.’<br><br> ‘Sweet are the uses of motherhood! So that's how you got around<br> him. Well, you've got him where you want him now, poor devil, as<br> shackled to you by obligations as any of your convicts are by their<br> chains. And I wish you both joy. But, as I said at the beginning<br> of this discussion, you'll never get another cent out of me for any<br> of your little unladylike schemes, my double-dealing lady.’<br><br> She was smarting with anger and with disappointment as well. For<br> some time she had been planning to borrow more money from Rhett to<br> buy a lot downtown and start a lumber yard there.<br><br> ‘I can do without your money,’ she cried. ‘I'm making money out of<br> Johnnie Gallegher's mill, plenty of it, now that I don't use free<br> darkies and I have some money out on mortgages and we are coining<br> cash at the store from the darky trade.’<br><br> ‘Yes, so I heard. How clever of you to rook the helpless and the<br> widow and the orphan and the ignorant! But if you must steal,<br> Scarlett, why not steal from the rich and strong instead of the<br> poor and weak? From Robin Hood on down to now, that's been<br> considered highly moral.’<br><br> ‘Because,’ said Scarlett shortly, ‘it's a sight easier and safer to<br> steal--as you call it--from the poor.’<br><br> He laughed silently, his shoulders shaking.<br><br> ‘You're a fine honest rogue, Scarlett!’<br><br> A rogue! Queer that that term should hurt. She wasn't a rogue,<br> she told herself vehemently. At least, that wasn't what she wanted<br> to be. She wanted to be a great lady. For a moment her mind went<br> swiftly down the years and she saw her mother, moving with a sweet<br> swish of skirts and a faint fragrance of sachet, her small busy<br> hands tireless in the service of others, loved, respected,<br> cherished. And suddenly her heart was sick.<br><br> ‘If you are trying to devil me,’ she said tiredly, ‘it's no use. I<br> know I'm not as--scrupulous as I should be these days. Not as kind<br> and as pleasant as I was brought up to be. But I can't help it,<br> Rhett. Truly, I can't. What else could I have done? What would<br> have happened to me, to Wade, to Tara and all of us if I'd been--<br> gentle when that Yankee came to Tara? I should have been--but I<br> don't even want to think of that. And when Jonas Wilkerson was<br> going to take the home place, suppose I'd been--kind and<br> scrupulous? Where would we all be now? And if I'd been sweet and<br> simple minded and not nagged Frank about bad debts we'd--oh, well.<br> Maybe I am a rogue, but I won't be a rogue forever, Rhett. But<br> during these past years--and even now--what else could I have done?<br> How else could I have acted? I've felt that I was trying to row a<br> heavily loaded boat in a storm. I've had so much trouble just<br> trying to keep afloat that I couldn't be bothered about things that<br> didn't matter, things I could part with easily and not miss, like<br> good manners and--well, things like that. I've been too afraid my<br> boat would be swamped and so I've dumped overboard the things that<br> seemed least important.’<br><br> ‘Pride and honor and truth and virtue and kindliness,’ he<br> enumerated silkily. ‘You are right, Scarlett. They aren't<br> important when a boat is sinking. But look around you at your<br> friends. Either they are bringing their boats ashore safely with<br> cargoes intact or they are content to go down with all flags<br> flying.’<br><br> ‘They are a passel of fools,’ she said shortly. ‘There's a time<br> for all things. When I've got plenty of money, I'll be nice as you<br> please, too. Butter won't melt in my mouth. I can afford to be<br> then.’<br><br> ‘You can afford to be--but you won't. It's hard to salvage<br> jettisoned cargo and, if it is retrieved, it's usually irreparably<br> damaged. And I fear that when you can afford to fish up the honor<br> and virtue and kindness you've thrown overboard, you'll find they<br> have suffered a sea change and not, I fear, into something rich and<br> strange. . . .’<br><br> He rose suddenly and picked up his hat.<br><br> ‘You are going?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Aren't you relieved? I leave you to what remains of your<br> conscience.’<br><br> He paused and looked down at the baby, putting out a finger for the<br> child to grip.<br><br> ‘I suppose Frank is bursting with pride?’<br><br> ‘Oh, of course.’<br><br> ‘Has a lot of plans for this baby, I suppose?’<br><br> ‘Oh, well, you know how silly men are about their babies.’<br><br> ‘Then, tell him,’ said Rhett and stopped short, an odd look on his<br> face, ‘tell him if he wants to see his plans for his child work<br> out, he'd better stay home at night more often than he's doing.’<br><br> ‘What do you mean?’<br><br> ‘Just what I say. Tell him to stay home.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you vile creature! To insinuate that poor Frank would--’<br><br> ‘Oh, good Lord!’ Rhett broke into a roar of laughter. ‘I didn't<br> mean he was running around with women! Frank! Oh, good Lord!’<br><br> He went down the steps still laughing.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLIV<br><br> <br> The march afternoon was windy and cold, and Scarlett pulled the lap<br> robe high under her arms as she drove out the Decatur road toward<br> Johnnie Gallegher's mill. Driving alone was hazardous these days<br> and she knew it, more hazardous than ever before, for now the<br> negroes were completely out of hand. As Ashley had prophesied,<br> there had been hell to pay since the legislature refused to ratify<br> the amendment. The stout refusal had been like a slap in the face<br> of the furious North and retaliation had come swiftly. The North<br> was determined to force the negro vote on the state and, to this<br> end, Georgia had been declared in rebellion and put under the<br> strictest martial law. Georgia's very existence as a state had<br> been wiped out and it had become, with Florida and Alabama,<br> ‘Military District Number Three,’ under the command of a Federal<br> general.<br><br> If life had been insecure and frightening before this, it was<br> doubly so now. The military regulations which had seemed so<br> stringent the year before were now mild by comparison with the ones<br> issued by General Pope. Confronted with the prospect of negro<br> rule, the future seemed dark and hopeless, and the embittered state<br> smarted and writhed helplessly. As for the negroes, their new<br> importance went to their heads, and, realizing that they had the<br> Yankee Army behind them, their outrages increased. No one was safe<br> from them.<br><br> In this wild and fearful time, Scarlett was frightened--frightened<br> but determined, and she still made her rounds alone, with Frank's<br> pistol tucked in the upholstery of the buggy. She silently cursed<br> the legislature for bringing this worse disaster upon them all.<br> What good had it done, this fine brave stand, this gesture which<br> everyone called gallant? It had just made matters so much worse.<br><br> As she drew near the path that led down through the bare trees into<br> the creek bottom where the Shantytown settlement was, she clucked<br> to the horse to quicken his speed. She always felt uneasy driving<br> past this dirty, sordid cluster of discarded army tents and slave<br> cabins. It had the worst reputation of any spot in or near<br> Atlanta, for here lived in filth outcast negroes, black prostitutes<br> and a scattering of poor whites of the lowest order. It was<br> rumored to be the refuge of negro and white criminals and was the<br> first place the Yankee soldiers searched when they wanted a man.<br> Shootings and cuttings went on here with such regularity that the<br> authorities seldom troubled to investigate and generally left the<br> Shantytowners to settle their own dark affairs. Back in the woods<br> there was a still that manufactured a cheap quality of corn whisky<br> and, by night, the cabins in the creek bottoms resounded with<br> drunken yells and curses.<br><br> Even the Yankees admitted that it was a plague spot and should be<br> wiped out, but they took no steps in this direction. Indignation<br> was loud among the inhabitants of Atlanta and Decatur who were<br> forced to use the road for travel between the two towns. Men went<br> by Shantytown with their pistols loosened in their holsters and<br> nice women never willingly passed it, even under the protection of<br> their men, for usually there were drunken negro slatterns sitting<br> along the road, hurling insults and shouting coarse words.<br><br> As long as she had Archie beside her, Scarlett had not given<br> Shantytown a thought, because not even the most impudent negro<br> woman dared laugh in her presence. But since she had been forced<br> to drive alone, there had been any number of annoying, maddening<br> incidents. The negro sluts seemed to try themselves whenever she<br> drove by. There was nothing she could do except ignore them and<br> boil with rage. She could not even take comfort in airing her<br> troubles to her neighbors or family because the neighbors would say<br> triumphantly: ‘Well, what else did you expect?’ And her family<br> would take on dreadfully again and try to stop her. And she had no<br> intention of stopping her trips.<br><br> Thank Heaven, there were no ragged women along the roadside today!<br> As she passed the trail leading down to the settlement she looked<br> with distaste at the group of shacks squatting in the hollow in the<br> dreary slant of the afternoon sun. There was a chill wind blowing,<br> and as she passed there came to her nose the mingled smells of wood<br> smoke, frying pork and untended privies. Averting her nose, she<br> flapped the reins smartly across the horse's back and hurried him<br> past and around the bend of the road.<br><br> Just as she was beginning to draw a breath of relief, her heart<br> rose in her throat with sudden fright, for a huge negro slipped<br> silently from behind a large oak tree. She was frightened but not<br> enough to lose her wits and, in an instant, the horse was pulled up<br> and she had Frank's pistol in her hand.<br><br> ‘What do you want?’ she cried with all the sternness she could<br> muster. The big negro ducked back behind the oak, and the voice<br> that answered was frightened.<br><br> ‘Lawd, Miss Scarlett, doan shoot Big Sam!’<br><br> Big Sam! For a moment she could not take in his words. Big Sam,<br> the foreman of Tara whom she had seen last in the days of the<br> siege. What on earth . . .<br><br> ‘Come out of there and let me see if you are really Sam!’<br><br> Reluctantly he slid out of his hiding place, a giant ragged figure,<br> bare-footed, clad in denim breeches and a blue Union uniform jacket<br> that was far too short and tight for his big frame. When she saw<br> it was really Big Sam, she shoved the pistol down into the<br> upholstery and smiled with pleasure.<br><br> ‘Oh, Sam! How nice to see you!’<br><br> Sam galloped over to the buggy, his eyes rolling with joy and his<br> white teeth flashing, and clutched her outstretched hand with two<br> black hands as big as hams. His watermelon-pink tongue lapped out,<br> his whole body wiggled and his joyful contortions were as ludicrous<br> as the gambolings of a mastiff.<br><br> ‘Mah Lawd, it sho is good ter see some of de fambly agin!’ he<br> cried, scrunching her hand until she felt that the bones would<br> crack. ‘Hucoome you got so mean lak, totin' a gun, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘So many mean folks these days, Sam, that I have to tote it. What<br> on earth are you doing in a nasty place like Shantytown, you, a<br> respectable darky? And why haven't you been into town to see me?’<br><br> ‘Law'm, Miss Scarlett, ah doan lib in Shantytown. Ah jes' bidin'<br> hyah fer a spell. Ah wouldn' lib in dat place for nuthin'. Ah<br> nebber in mah life seed sech trashy niggers. An' Ah din' know you<br> wuz in 'Lanta. Ah thought you wuz at Tara. Ah wuz aimin' ter come<br> home ter Tara soon as Ah got de chance.’<br><br> ‘Have you been living in Atlanta ever since the siege?’<br><br> ‘No, Ma'm! Ah been trabelin'!’ He released her hand and she<br> painfully flexed it to see if the bones were intact. ‘'Member w'en<br> you seed me las'?’<br><br> Scarlett remembered the hot day before the siege began when she and<br> Rhett had sat in the carriage and the gang of negroes with Big Sam<br> at their head had marched down the dusty street toward the<br> entrenchments singing ‘Go Down, Moses.’ She nodded.<br><br> ‘Wel, Ah wuked lak a dawg diggin' bresswuks an' fillin' San' bags,<br> tell de Confedruts lef' 'Lanta. De cap'n gempmum whut had me in<br> charge, he wuz kilt an' dar warn't nobody ter tell Big Sam whut ter<br> do, so Ah jes' lay low in de bushes. Ah thought Ah'd try ter git<br> home ter Tara, but den Ah hear dat all de country roun' Tara done<br> buhnt up. 'Sides, Ah din' hab no way ter git back an' Ah wuz<br> sceered de patterollers pick me up, kase Ah din' hab no pass. Den<br> de Yankees come in an' a Yankee gempmum, he wuz a cunnel, he tek a<br> shine ter me an' he keep me te ten' ter his hawse an' his boots.<br><br> ‘Yas, Ma'm! Ah sho did feel bigitty, bein' a body serbant lak<br> Poke, w'en Ah ain' nuthin' but a fe'el han'. Ah ain' tell de<br> Cunnel Ah wuz a fe'el han' an' he-- Well, Miss Scarlett, Yankees<br> is iggerunt folks! He din' know de diffunce! So Ah stayed wid him<br> an' Ah went ter Sabannah wid him w'en Gin'ul Sherman went dar, an'<br> fo' Gawd, Miss Scarlett, Ah nebber seed sech awful goin'-ons as Ah<br> seed on de way ter Sabannah! A-stealin' an' a-buhnin'--did dey<br> buhn Tara, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘They set fire to it, but we put it out.’<br><br> ‘Well'm, Ah sho glad ter hear dat. Tara mah home an' Ah is aimin'<br> ter go back dar. An' w'en de wah ober, de Cunnel he say ter me:<br> 'You Sam! You come on back Nawth wid me. Ah pay you good wages.'<br> Well'm, lak all de niggers, Ah wuz honin' ter try disyere freedom<br> fo' Ah went home, so Ah goes Nawth wid de Cunnel. Yas'm, us went<br> ter Washington an' Noo Yawk an' den ter Bawston whar de Cunnel lib.<br> Yas, Ma'am, Ah's a trabeled nigger! Miss Scarlett, dar's mo'<br> hawses and cah'iges on dem Yankee streets dan you kin shake a stick<br> at! Ah wuz sceered all de time Ah wuz gwine git runned ober!’<br><br> ‘Did you like it up North, Sam?’<br><br> Sam scratched his woolly head.<br><br> ‘Ah did--an' Ah din't. De Cunnel, he a mighty fine man an' he<br> unnerstan' niggers. But his wife, she sumpin' else. His wife, she<br> call me 'Mister' fust time she seed me. Yas'm, she do dat an' Ah<br> lak ter drap in mah tracks w'en she do it. De Cunnel, he tell her<br> ter call me 'Sam' an' den she do it. But all dem Yankee folks,<br> fust time dey meet me, dey call me 'Mist' O'Hara.' An' dey ast me<br> ter set down wid dem, lak Ah wuz jes' as good as dey wuz. Well, Ah<br> ain' nebber set down wid w'ite folks an' Ah is too ole ter learn.<br> Dey treat me lak Ah jes' as good as dey wuz, Miss Scarlett, but in<br> dere hearts, dey din' lak me--dey din' lak no niggers. An' dey wuz<br> sceered of me, kase Ah's so big. An' dey wuz allus astin' me 'bout<br> de blood houn's dat chase me an' de beatin's Ah got. An', Lawd,<br> Miss Scarlett, Ah ain' nebber got no beatin's! You know Mist'<br> Gerald ain' gwine let nobody beat a 'spensive nigger lak me!<br><br> ‘W'en Ah tell dem dat an' tell dem how good Miss Ellen ter de<br> niggers, an' how she set up a whole week wid me w'en Ah had de<br> pneumony, dey doan b'lieve me. An', Miss Scarlett, Ah got ter<br> honin' fer Miss Ellen an' Tara, tell it look lak Ah kain stan' it<br> no longer, an' one night Ah lit out fer home, an' Ah rid de freight<br> cabs all de way down ter 'Lanta. Ef you buy me a ticket ter Tara,<br> Ah sho be glad ter git home. Ah sho be glad ter see Miss Ellen and<br> Mist' Gerald agin. An done had nuff freedom. Ah wants somebody<br> ter feed me good vittles reg'lar, and tell me whut ter do an' whut<br> not ter do, an' look affer me w'en Ah gits sick. S'pose Ah gits de<br> pneumony agin? Is dat Yankee lady gwine tek keer of me? No, Ma'm!<br> She gwine call me 'Mist' O'Hara' but she ain' gwine nuss me. But<br> Miss Ellen, she gwine nuss me, do Ah git sick an'--whut's de<br> mattuh, Miss Scarlett?’<br><br> ‘Pa and Mother are both dead, Sam.’<br><br> ‘Daid? Is you funnin' wid me, Miss Scarlett? Dat ain' no way ter<br> treat me!’<br><br> ‘I'm not funning. It's true. Mother died when Sherman men came<br> through Tara and Pa--he went last June. Oh, Sam, don't cry.<br> Please don't! If you do, I'll cry too. Sam, don't! I just can't<br> stand it. Let's don't talk about it now. I'll tell you all about<br> it some other time. . . . Miss Suellen is at Tara and she's<br> married to a mighty fine man, Mr. Will Benteen. And Miss Carreen,<br> she's in a--’ Scarlett paused. She could never make plain to the<br> weeping giant what a convent was. ‘She's living in Charleston now.<br> But Pork and Prissy are at Tara. . . . There, Sam, wipe your nose.<br> Do you really want to go home?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm but it ain' gwine be lak Ah thought wid Miss Ellen an'--’<br><br> ‘Sam, how'd you like to stay here in Atlanta and work for me? I<br> need a driver and I need one bad with so many mean folks around<br> these days.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm. You sho do. Ah been aimin' ter say you ain' got no bizness<br> drivin' 'round by yo'seff, Miss Scarlett. You ain' got no notion<br> how mean some niggers is dese days, specially dem whut live hyah in<br> Shantytown. It ain' safe fer you. Ah ain' been in Shantytown but<br> two days, but Ah hear dem talk 'bout you. An' yesterday w'en you<br> druv by an' dem trashy black wenches holler at you, Ah recernize<br> you but you went by so fas' Ah couldn' ketch you. But Ah sho tan<br> de hides of dem niggers! Ah sho did. Ain' you notice dar ain'<br> none of dem roun' hyah terday?’<br><br> ‘I did notice and I certainly thank you, Sam. Well, how would you<br> like to be my carriage man?’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, thankee, Ma'm, but Ah specs Ah better go ter Tara.’<br><br> Big Sam looked down and his bare toe traced aimless marks in the<br> road. There was a furtive uneasiness about him.<br><br> ‘Now, why? I'll pay you good wages. You must stay with me.’<br><br> The big black face, stupid and as easily read as a child's, looked<br> up at her and there was fear in it. He came closer and, leaning<br> over the side of the buggy, whispered:<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett, Ah got ter git outer 'Lanta. Ah got ter git ter<br> Tara whar dey woan fine me. Ah--Ah done kilt a man.’<br><br> ‘A darky?’<br><br> ‘No'm. A w'ite man. A Yankee sojer and dey's lookin' fer me. Dat<br> de reason Ah'm hyah at Shantytown.’<br><br> ‘How did it happen?’<br><br> ‘He wuz drunk an' he said sumpin' Ah couldn' tek noways an' Ah got<br> mah han's on his neck--an' Ah din' mean ter kill him, Miss<br> Scarlett, but mah han's is pow'ful strong, an' fo' Ah knowed it, he<br> wuz kilt. An' Ah wuz so sceered Ah din' know whut ter do! So Ah<br> come out hyah ter hide an' w'en Ah seed you go by yestiddy, Ah says<br> 'Bress Gawd! Dar Miss Scarlett! She tek keer of me. She ain'<br> gwine let de Yankees git me. She sen' me back ter Tara.’<br><br> ‘You say they're after you? They know you did it?’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, Ah's so big dar ain' no mistakin' me. Ah spec Ah's de<br> bigges' nigger in 'Lanta. Dey done been out hyah already affer me<br> las' night but a nigger gal, she hid me in a cabe ober in de woods,<br> tell dey wuz gone.’<br><br> Scarlett sat frowning for a moment. She was not in the least<br> alarmed or distressed that Sam had committed murder, but she was<br> disappointed that she could not have him as a driver. A big negro<br> like Sam would be as good a bodyguard as Archie. Well, she must<br> get him safe to Tara somehow, for of course the authorities must<br> not get him. He was too valuable a darky to be hanged. Why, he<br> was the best foreman Tara had ever had! It did not enter<br> Scarlett's mind that he was free. He still belonged to her, like<br> Pork and Mammy and Peter and Cookie and Prissy. He was still ‘one<br> of our family’ and, as such, must be protected.<br><br> ‘I'll send you to Tara tonight,’ she said finally. ‘Now Sam, I've<br> got to drive out the road a piece, but I ought to be back here<br> before sundown. You be waiting here for me when I come back.<br> Don't tell anyone where you are going and if you've got a hat,<br> bring it along to hide your face.’<br><br> ‘Ah ain' got no hat.’<br><br> ‘Well, here's a quarter. You buy a hat from one of those shanty<br> darkies and meet me here.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm.’ His face glowed with relief at once more having someone<br> to tell him what to do.<br><br> Scarlett drove on thoughtfully. Will would certainly welcome a<br> good field hand at Tara. Pork had never been any good in the<br> fields and never would be any good. With Sam on the place, Pork<br> could come to Atlanta and join Dilcey as she had promised him when<br> Gerald died.<br><br> When she reached the mill the sun was setting and it was later than<br> she cared to be out. Johnnie Gallegher was standing in the doorway<br> of the miserable shack that served as cook room for the little<br> lumber camp. Sitting on a log in front of the slab-sided shack<br> that was their sleeping quarters were four of the five convicts<br> Scarlett had apportioned to Johnnie's mill. Their convict uniforms<br> were dirty and foul with sweat, shackles clanked between their<br> ankles when they moved tiredly, and there was an air of apathy and<br> despair about them. They were a thin, unwholesome lot, Scarlett<br> thought, peering sharply at them, and when she had leased them, so<br> short a time before, they were an upstanding crew. They did not<br> even raise their eyes as she dismounted from the buggy but Johnnie<br> turned toward her, carelessly dragging off his hat. His little<br> brown face was as hard as a nut as he greeted her.<br><br> ‘I don't like the look of the men,’ she said abruptly. ‘They don't<br> look well. Where's the other one?’<br><br> ‘Says he's sick,’ said Johnnie laconically. ‘He's in the bunk<br> house.’<br><br> ‘What ails him?’<br><br> ‘Laziness, mostly.’<br><br> ‘I'll go see him.’<br><br> ‘Don't do that. He's probably nekkid. I'll tend to him. He'll be<br> back at work tomorrow.’<br><br> Scarlett hesitated and saw one of the convicts raise a weary head<br> and give Johnnie a stare of intense hatred before he looked at the<br> ground again.<br><br> ‘Have you been whipping these men?’<br><br> ‘Now, Mrs. Kennedy, begging your pardon, who's running this mill?<br> You put me in charge and told me to run it. You said I'd have a<br> free hand. You ain't got no complaints to make of me, have you?<br> Ain't I making twice as much for you as Mr. Elsing did?’<br><br> ‘Yes, you are,’ said Scarlett, but a shiver went over her, like a<br> goose walking across her grave.<br><br> There was something sinister about this camp with its ugly shacks,<br> something which had not been here when Hugh Elsing had it. There<br> was a loneliness, an isolation, about it that chilled her. These<br> convicts were so far away from everything, so completely at the<br> mercy of Johnnie Gallegher, and if he chose to whip them or<br> otherwise mistreat them, she would probably never know about it.<br> The convicts would be afraid to complain to her for fear of worse<br> punishment after she was gone.<br><br> ‘The men look thin. Are you giving them enough to eat? God knows,<br> I spend enough money on their food to make them fat as hogs. The<br> flour and pork alone cost thirty dollars last month. What are you<br> giving them for supper?’<br><br> She stepped over to the cook shack and looked in. A fat mulatto<br> woman, who was leaning over a rusty old stove, dropped a half<br> curtsy as she saw Scarlett and went on stirring a pot in which<br> black-eyed peas were cooking. Scarlett knew Johnnie Gallegher<br> lived with her but thought it best to ignore the fact. She saw<br> that except for the peas and a pan of corn pone there was no other<br> food being prepared.<br><br> ‘Haven't you got anything else for these men?’<br><br> ‘No'm.’<br><br> ‘Haven't you got any side meat in these peas?’<br><br> ‘No'm.’<br><br> ‘No boiling bacon in the peas? But black-eyed peas are no good<br> without bacon. There's no strength to them. Why isn't there any<br> bacon?’<br><br> ‘Mist' Johnnie, he say dar ain' no use puttin' in no side meat.’<br><br> ‘You'll put bacon in. Where do you keep your supplies?’<br><br> The negro woman rolled frightened eyes toward the small closet that<br> served as a pantry and Scarlett threw the door open. There was an<br> open barrel of cornmeal on the floor, a small sack of flour, a<br> pound of coffee, a little sugar, a gallon jug of sorghum and two<br> hams. One of the hams sitting on the shelf had been recently<br> cooked and only one or two slices had been cut from it. Scarlett<br> turned in a fury on Johnnie Gallegher and met his coldly angry<br> gaze.<br><br> ‘Where are the five sacks of white flour I sent out last week? And<br> the sugar sack and the coffee? And I had five hams sent and ten<br> pounds of side meat and God knows how many bushels of yams and<br> Irish potatoes. Well, where are they? You can't have used them<br> all in a week if you fed the men five meals a day. You've sold<br> them! That's what you've done, you thief! Sold my good supplies<br> and put the money in your pocket and fed these men on dried peas<br> and corn pone. No wonder they look so thin. Get out of the way.’<br><br> She stormed past him to the doorway.<br><br> ‘You, man, there on the end--yes, you! Come here!’<br><br> The man rose and walked awkwardly toward her, his shackles<br> clanking, and she saw that his bare ankles were red and raw from<br> the chafing of the iron.<br><br> ‘When did you last have ham?’<br><br> The man looked down at the ground.<br><br> ‘Speak up.’<br><br> Still the man stood silent and abject. Finally he raised his eyes,<br> looked Scarlett in the face imploringly and dropped his gaze again.<br><br> ‘Scared to talk, eh? Well, go in the pantry and get that ham off<br> the shelf. Rebecca, give him your knife. Take it out to those men<br> and divide it up. Rebecca, make some biscuits and coffee for the<br> men. And serve plenty of sorghum. Start now, so I can see you do<br> it.’<br><br> ‘Dat's Mist' Johnnie's privut flour an' coffee,’ Rebecca muttered<br> frightenedly.<br><br> ‘Mr. Johnnie's, my foot! I suppose it's his private ham too. You<br> do what I say. Get busy. Johnnie Gallegher, come out to the buggy<br> with me.’<br><br> She stalked across the littered yard and climbed into the buggy,<br> noticing with grim satisfaction that the men were tearing at the<br> ham and cramming bits into their mouths voraciously. They looked<br> as if they feared it would be taken from them at any minute.<br><br> ‘You are a rare scoundrel!’ she cried furiously to Johnnie as he<br> stood at the wheel, his hat pushed back from his lowering brow.<br> ‘And you can just hand over to me the price of my supplies. In the<br> future, I'll bring you provisions every day instead of ordering<br> them by the month. Then you can't cheat me.’<br><br> ‘In the future I won't be here,’ said Johnnie Gallegher.<br><br> ‘You mean you are quitting!’<br><br> For a moment it was on Scarlett's hot tongue to cry: ‘Go and good<br> riddance!’ but the cool hand of caution stopped her. If Johnnie<br> should quit, what would she do? He had been doubling the amount of<br> lumber Hugh turned out. And just now she had a big order, the<br> biggest she had ever had and a rush order at that. She had to get<br> that lumber into Atlanta. If Johnnie quit, whom would she get to<br> take over the mill?<br><br> ‘Yes, I'm quitting. You put me in complete charge here and you<br> told me that all you expected of me was as much lumber as I could<br> possibly get out. You didn't tell me how to run my business then<br> and I'm not aiming to have you start now. How I get the lumber out<br> is no affair of yours. You can't complain that I've fallen down on<br> my bargain. I've made money for you and I've earned my salary--and<br> what I could pick up on the side, too. And here you come out here,<br> interfering, asking questions and breaking my authority in front of<br> the men. How can you expect me to keep discipline after this?<br> What if the men do get an occasional lick? The lazy scum deserve<br> worse. What if they ain't fed up and pampered? They don't deserve<br> nothing better. Either you tend to your business and let me tend<br> to mine or I quit tonight.’<br><br> His hard little face looked flintier than ever and Scarlett was in<br> a quandary. If he quit tonight, what would she do? She couldn't<br> stay here all night guarding the convicts!<br><br> Something of her dilemma showed in her eyes for Johnnie's<br> expression changed subtly and some of the hardness went out of his<br> face. There was an easy agreeable note in his voice when he spoke.<br><br> ‘It's getting late, Mrs. Kennedy, and you'd better be getting on<br> home. We ain't going to fall out over a little thing like this,<br> are we? S'pose you take ten dollars out of my next month's wages<br> and let's call it square.’<br><br> Scarlett's eyes went unwillingly to the miserable group gnawing on<br> the ham and she thought of the sick man lying in the windy shack.<br> She ought to get rid of Johnnie Gallegher. He was a thief and a<br> brutal man. There was no telling what he did to the convicts when<br> she wasn't there. But, on the other hand, he was smart and, God<br> knows, she needed a smart man. Well, she couldn't part with him<br> now. He was making money for her. She'd just have to see to it<br> that the convicts got their proper rations in the future.<br><br> ‘I'll take twenty dollars out of your wages,’ she said shortly,<br> ‘and I'll be back and discuss the matter further in the morning.’<br><br> She picked up the reins. But she knew there would be no further<br> discussion. She knew that the matter had ended there and she knew<br> Johnnie knew it.<br><br> As she drove off down the path to the Decatur road her conscience<br> battled with her desire for money. She knew she had no business<br> exposing human lives to the hard little man's mercies. If he<br> should cause the death of one of them she would be as guilty as he<br> was, for she had kept him in charge after learning of his<br> brutalities. But, on the other hand--well, on the other hand, men<br> had no business getting to be convicts. If they broke laws and got<br> caught, then they deserved what they got. This partly salved her<br> conscience but as she drove down the road the dull thin faces of<br> the convicts would keep coming back into her mind.<br><br> ‘Oh, I'll think of them later,’ she decided, and pushed the thought<br> into the lumber room of her mind and shut the door upon it.<br><br> <br><br> The sun had completely gone when she reached the bend in the road<br> above Shantytown and the woods about her were dark. With the<br> disappearance of the sun, a bitter chill had fallen on the twilight<br> world and a cold wind blew through the dark woods, making the bare<br> boughs crack and the dead leaves rustle. She had never been out<br> this late by herself and she was uneasy and wished herself home.<br><br> Big Sam was nowhere to be seen and, as she drew rein to wait for<br> him, she worried about his absence, fearing the Yankees might have<br> already picked him up. Then she heard footsteps coming up the path<br> from the settlement and a sigh of relief went through her lips.<br> She'd certainly dress Sam down for keeping her waiting.<br><br> But it wasn't Sam who came round the bend.<br><br> It was a big ragged white man and a squat black negro with<br> shoulders and chest like a gorilla. Swiftly she flapped the reins<br> on the horse's back and clutched the pistol. The horse started to<br> trot and suddenly shied as the white man threw up his hand.<br><br> ‘Lady,’ he said, ‘can you give me a quarter? I'm sure hungry.’<br><br> ‘Get out of the way,’ she answered, keeping her voice as steady as<br> she could. ‘I haven't got any money. Giddap.’<br><br> With a sudden swift movement the man's hand was on the horse's<br> bridle.<br><br> ‘Grab her!’ he shouted to the negro. ‘She's probably got her money<br> in her bosom!’<br><br> What happened next was like a nightmare to Scarlett, and it all<br> happened so quickly. She brought up her pistol swiftly and some<br> instinct told her not to fire at the white man for fear of shooting<br> the horse. As the negro came running to the buggy, his black face<br> twisted in a leering grin, she fired point-blank at him. Whether<br> or not she hit him, she never knew, but the next minute the pistol<br> was wrenched from her hand by a grasp that almost broke her wrist.<br> The negro was beside her, so close that she could smell the rank<br> odor of him as he tried to drag her over the buggy side. With her<br> one free hand she fought madly, clawing at his face, and then she<br> felt his big hand at her throat and, with a ripping noise, her<br> basque was torn open from neck to waist. Then the black hand<br> fumbled between her breasts, and terror and revulsion such as she<br> had never known came over her and she screamed like an insane<br> woman.<br><br> ‘Shut her up! Drag her out!’ cried the white man, and the black<br> hand fumbled across Scarlett's face to her mouth. She bit as<br> savagely as she could and then screamed again, and through her<br> screaming she heard the white man swear and realized that there was<br> a third man in the dark road. The black hand dropped from her<br> mouth and the negro leaped away as Big Sam charged at him.<br><br> ‘Run, Miss Scarlett!’ yelled Sam, grappling with the negro; and<br> Scarlett, shaking and screaming, clutched up the reins and whip and<br> laid them both over the horse. It went off at a jump and she felt<br> the wheels pass over something soft, something resistant. It was<br> the white man who lay in the road where Sam had knocked him down.<br><br> Maddened by terror, she lashed the horse again and again and it<br> struck a gait that made the buggy rock and sway. Through her<br> terror she was conscious of the sound of feet running behind her<br> and she screamed at the horse to go faster. If that black ape got<br> her again, she would die before he even got his hands upon her.<br><br> A voice yelled behind her: ‘Miss Scarlett! Stop!’<br><br> Without slacking, she looked trembling over her shoulder and saw<br> Big Sam racing down the road behind her, his long legs working like<br> hard-driven pistons. She drew rein as he came up and he flung<br> himself into the buggy, his big body crowding her to one side.<br> Sweat and blood were streaming down his face as he panted:<br><br> ‘Is you hu't? Did dey hu't you?’<br><br> She could not speak, but seeing the direction of his eyes and their<br> quick averting, she realized that her basque was open to the waist<br> and her bare bosom and corset cover were showing. With a shaking<br> hand she clutched the two edges together and bowing her head began<br> to cry in terrified sobs.<br><br> ‘Gimme dem lines,’ said Sam, snatching the reins from her. ‘Hawse,<br> mek tracks!’<br><br> The whip cracked and the startled horse went off at a wild gallop<br> that threatened to throw the buggy into the ditch.<br><br> ‘Ah hope Ah done kill dat black baboon. But Ah din' wait ter fine<br> out,’ he panted. ‘But ef he hahmed you, Miss Scarlett, Ah'll go<br> back an' mek sho of it.’<br><br> ‘No--no--drive on quickly,’ she sobbed.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLV<br><br> <br> That night when Frank deposited her and Aunt Pitty and the children<br> at Melanie's and rode off down the street with Ashley, Scarlett<br> could have burst with rage and hurt. How could he go off to a<br> political meeting on this of all nights in the world? A political<br> meeting! And on the same night when she had been attacked, when<br> anything might have happened to her! It was unfeeling and selfish<br> of him. But then, he had taken the whole affair with maddening<br> calm, ever since Sam had carried her sobbing into the house, her<br> basque gaping to the waist. He hadn't clawed his beard even once<br> when she cried out her story. He had just questioned gently:<br> ‘Sugar, are you hurt--or just scared?’<br><br> Wrath mingling with her tears she had been unable to answer and Sam<br> had volunteered that she was just scared.<br><br> ‘Ah got dar fo' dey done mo'n t'ar her dress.’<br><br> ‘You're a good boy, Sam, and I won't forget what you've done. If<br> there's anything I can do for you--’<br><br> ‘Yassah, you kin sen' me ter Tara, quick as you kin. De Yankees is<br> affer me.’<br><br> Frank had listened to this statement calmly too, and had asked no<br> questions. He had looked very much as he did the night Tony came<br> beating on their door, as though this was an exclusively masculine<br> affair and one to be handled with a minimum of words and emotions.<br><br> ‘You go get in the buggy. I'll have Peter drive you as far as<br> Rough and Ready tonight and you can hide in the woods till morning<br> and then catch the train to Jonesboro. It'll be safer. . . . Now,<br> Sugar, stop crying. It's all over now and you aren't really hurt.<br> Miss Pitty, could I have your smelling salts? And Mammy, fetch<br> Miss Scarlett a glass of wine.’<br><br> Scarlett had burst into renewed tears, this time tears of rage.<br> She wanted comforting, indignation, threats of vengeance. She<br> would even have preferred him storming at her, saying that this was<br> just what he had warned her would happen--anything rather than have<br> him take it all so casually and treat her danger as a matter of<br> small moment. He was nice and gentle, of course, but in an absent<br> way as if he had something far more important on his mind.<br><br> And that important thing had turned out to be a small political<br> meeting!<br><br> She could hardly believe her ears when he told her to change her<br> dress and get ready for him to escort her over to Melanie's for the<br> evening. He must know how harrowing her experience had been, must<br> know she did not want to spend an evening at Melanie's when her<br> tired body and jangled nerves cried out for the warm relaxation of<br> bed and blankets--with a hot brick to make her toes tingle and a<br> hot toddy to soothe her fears. If he really loved her, nothing<br> could have forced him from her side on this of all nights. He<br> would have stayed home and held her hand and told her over and over<br> that he would have died if anything had happened to her. And when<br> he came home tonight and she had him alone, she would certainly<br> tell him so.<br><br> Melanie's small parlor looked as serene as it usually did on nights<br> when Frank and Ashley were away and the women gathered together to<br> sew. The room was warm and cheerful in the firelight. The lamp on<br> the table shed a quiet yellow glow on the four smooth heads bent to<br> their needlework. Four skirts billowed modestly, eight small feet<br> were daintily placed on low hassocks. The quiet breathing of Wade,<br> Ella and Beau came through the open door of the nursery. Archie<br> sat on a stool by the hearth, his back against the fireplace, his<br> cheek distended with tobacco, whittling industriously on a bit of<br> wood. The contrast between the dirty, hairy old man and the four<br> neat, fastidious ladies was as great as though he were a grizzled,<br> vicious old watchdog and they four small kittens.<br><br> Melanie's soft voice, tinged with indignation, went on and on as<br> she told of the recent outburst of temperament on the part of the<br> Lady Harpists. Unable to agree with the Gentlemen's Glee Club as<br> to the program for their next recital, the ladies had waited on<br> Melanie that afternoon and announced their intention of withdrawing<br> completely from the Musical Circle. It had taken all of Melanie's<br> diplomacy to persuade them to defer their decision.<br><br> Scarlett, overwrought, could have screamed: ‘Oh, damn the Lady<br> Harpists!’ She wanted to talk about her dreadful experience. She<br> was bursting to relate it in detail, so she could ease her own<br> fright by frightening the others. She wanted to tell how brave she<br> had been, just to assure herself by the sound of her own words that<br> she had, indeed, been brave. But every time she brought up the<br> subject, Melanie deftly steered the conversation into other and<br> innocuous channels. This irritated Scarlett almost beyond<br> endurance. They were as mean as Frank.<br><br> How could they be so calm and placid when she had just escaped so<br> terrible a fate? They weren't even displaying common courtesy in<br> denying her the relief of talking about it.<br><br> The events of the afternoon had shaken her more than she cared to<br> admit, even to herself. Every time she thought of that malignant<br> black face peering at her from the shadows of the twilight forest<br> road, she fell to trembling. When she thought of the black hand at<br> her bosom and what would have happened if Big Sam had not appeared,<br> she bent her head lower and squeezed her eyes tightly shut. The<br> longer she sat silent in the peaceful room, trying to sew,<br> listening to Melanie's voice, the tighter her nerves stretched.<br> She felt that at any moment she would actually hear them break with<br> the same pinging sound a banjo string makes when it snaps.<br><br> Archie's whittling annoyed her and she frowned at him. Suddenly it<br> seemed odd that he should be sitting there occupying himself with a<br> piece of wood. Usually he lay flat on the sofa, during the<br> evenings when he was on guard, and slept and snored so violently<br> that his long beard leaped into the air with each rumbling breath.<br> It was odder still that neither Melanie nor India hinted to him<br> that he should spread a paper on the floor to catch his litter of<br> shavings. He had already made a perfect mess on the hearth rug but<br> they did not seem to have noticed it.<br><br> While she watched him, Archie turned suddenly toward the fire and<br> spat a stream of tobacco juice on it with such vehemence that<br> India, Melanie and Pitty leaped as though a bomb had exploded.<br><br> ‘NEED you expectorate so loudly?’ cried India in a voice that<br> cracked with nervous annoyance. Scarlett looked at her in surprise<br> for India was always so self-contained.<br><br> Archie gave her look for look.<br><br> ‘I reckon I do,’ he answered coldly and spat again. Melanie gave a<br> little frowning glance at India.<br><br> ‘I was always so glad dear Papa didn't chew,’ began Pitty, and<br> Melanie, her frown creasing deeper, swung on her and spoke sharper<br> words than Scarlett had ever heard her speak.<br><br> ‘Oh, do hush, Auntie! You're so tactless.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear!’ Pitty dropped her sewing in her lap and her mouth<br> pressed up in hurt. ‘I declare, I don't know what ails you all<br> tonight. You and India are just as jumpy and cross as two old<br> sticks.’<br><br> No one answered her. Melanie did not even apologize for her<br> crossness but went back to her sewing with small violence.<br><br> ‘You're taking stitches an inch long,’ declared Pitty with some<br> satisfaction. ‘You'll have to take every one of them out. What's<br> the matter with you?’<br><br> But Melanie still did not answer.<br><br> Was there anything the matter with them, Scarlett wondered? Had<br> she been too absorbed with her own fears to notice? Yes, despite<br> Melanie's attempts to make the evening appear like any one of fifty<br> they had all spent together, there was a difference due to their<br> alarm and shock at what had happened that afternoon. Scarlett<br> stole glances at her companions and intercepted a look from India.<br> It discomforted her because it was a long, measuring glance that<br> carried in its cold depths something stronger than hate, something<br> more insulting than contempt.<br><br> ‘As though she thought I was to blame for what happened,’ Scarlett<br> thought indignantly.<br><br> India turned from her to Archie and, all annoyance at him gone from<br> her face, gave him a look of veiled anxious inquiry. But he did<br> not meet her eyes. He did however look at Scarlett, staring at her<br> in the same cold hard way India had done.<br><br> Silence fell dully in the room as Melanie did not take up the<br> conversation again and, in the silence, Scarlett heard the rising<br> wind outside. It suddenly began to be a most unpleasant evening.<br> Now she began to feel the tension in the air and she wondered if it<br> had been present all during the evening--and she too upset to<br> notice it. About Archie's face there was an alert waiting look and<br> his tufted, hairy old ears seemed pricked up like a lynx's. There<br> was a severely repressed uneasiness about Melanie and India that<br> made them raise their heads from their sewing at each sound of<br> hooves in the road, at each groan of bare branches under the<br> wailing wind, at each scuffing sound of dry leaves tumbling across<br> the lawn. They started at each soft snap of burning logs on the<br> hearth as if they were stealthy footsteps.<br><br> Something was wrong and Scarlett wondered what it was. Something<br> was afoot and she did not know about it. A glance at Aunt Pitty's<br> plump guileless face, screwed up in a pout, told her that the old<br> lady was as ignorant as she. But Archie and Melanie and India<br> knew. In the silence she could almost feel the thoughts of India<br> and Melanie whirling as madly as squirrels in a cage. They knew<br> something, were waiting for something, despite their efforts to<br> make things appear as usual. And their inner unease communicated<br> itself to Scarlett, making her more nervous than before. Handling<br> her needle awkwardly, she jabbed it into her thumb and with a<br> little scream of pain and annoyance that made them all jump, she<br> squeezed it until a bright red drop appeared.<br><br> ‘I'm just too nervous to sew,’ she declared, throwing her mending<br> to the floor. ‘I'm nervous enough to scream. I want to go home<br> and go to bed. And Frank knew it and he oughtn't to have gone out.<br> He talks, talks, talks about protecting women against darkies and<br> Carpetbaggers and when the time comes for him to do some<br> protecting, where is he? At home, taking care of me? No, indeed,<br> he's gallivanting around with a lot of other men who don't do<br> anything but talk and--’<br><br> Her snapping eyes came to rest on India's face and she paused.<br> India was breathing fast and her pale lashless eyes were fastened<br> on Scarlett's face with a deadly coldness.<br><br> ‘If it won't pain you too much, India,’ she broke off sarcastically,<br> ‘I'd be much obliged if you'd tell me why you've been staring at me<br> all evening. Has my face turned green or something?’<br><br> ‘It won't pain me to tell you. I'll do it with pleasure,’ said<br> India and her eyes glittered. ‘I hate to see you underrate a fine<br> man like Mr. Kennedy when, if you knew--’<br><br> ‘India!’ said Melanie warningly, her hands clenching on her sewing.<br><br> ‘I think I know my husband better than you do,’ said Scarlett, the<br> prospect of a quarrel, the first open quarrel she had ever had with<br> India, making her spirits rise and her nervousness depart.<br> Melanie's eyes caught India's and reluctantly India closed her<br> lips. But almost instantly she spoke again and her voice was cold<br> with hate.<br><br> ‘You make me sick, Scarlett O'Hara, talking about being protected!<br> You don't care about being protected! If you did you'd never have<br> exposed yourself as you have done all these months, prissing<br> yourself about this town, showing yourself off to strange men,<br> hoping they'll admire you! What happened to you this afternoon was<br> just what you deserved and if there was any justice you'd have<br> gotten worse.’<br><br> ‘Oh, India, hush!’ cried Melanie.<br><br> ‘Let her talk,’ cried Scarlett. ‘I'm enjoying it. I always knew<br> she hated me and she was too much of a hypocrite to admit it. If<br> she thought anyone would admire her, she'd be walking the streets<br> naked from dawn till dark.’<br><br> India was on her feet, her lean body quivering with insult.<br><br> ‘I do hate you,’ she said in a clear but trembling voice. ‘But it<br> hasn't been hypocrisy that's kept me quiet. It's something you<br> can't understand, not possessing any--any common courtesy, common<br> good breeding. It's the realization that if all of us don't hang<br> together and submerge our own small hates, we can't expect to beat<br> the Yankees. But you--you--you've done all you could to lower the<br> prestige of decent people--working and bringing shame on a good<br> husband, giving Yankees and riffraff the right to laugh at us and<br> make insulting remarks about our lack of gentility. Yankees don't<br> know that you aren't one of us and have never been. Yankees<br> haven't sense enough to know that you haven't any gentility. And<br> when you've ridden about the woods exposing yourself to attack,<br> you've exposed every well-behaved woman in town to attack by<br> putting temptation in the ways of darkies and mean white trash.<br> And you've put our men folks' lives in danger because they've got<br> to--’<br><br> ‘My God, India!’ cried Melanie and even in her wrath, Scarlett was<br> stunned to hear Melanie take the Lord's name in vain. ‘You must<br> hush! She doesn't know and she--you must hush! You promised--’<br><br> ‘Oh, girls!’ pleaded Miss Pittypat, her lips trembling.<br><br> ‘What don't I know?’ Scarlett was on her feet, furious, facing the<br> coldly blazing India and the imploring Melanie.<br><br> ‘Guinea hens,’ said Archie suddenly and his voice was contemptuous.<br> Before anyone could rebuke him, his grizzled head went up sharply<br> and he rose swiftly. ‘Somebody comin' up the walk. 'Tain't Mr.<br> Wilkes neither. Cease your cackle.’<br><br> There was male authority in his voice and the women stood suddenly<br> silent, anger fading swiftly from their faces as he stumped across<br> the room to the door.<br><br> ‘Who's thar?’ he questioned before the caller even knocked.<br><br> ‘Captain Butler. Let me in.’<br><br> Melanie was across the floor so swiftly that her hoops swayed up<br> violently, revealing her pantalets to the knees, and before Archie<br> could put his hand on the knob she flung the door open. Rhett<br> Butler stood in the doorway, his black slouch hat low over his<br> eyes, the wild wind whipping his cape about him in snapping folds.<br> For once his good manners had deserted him. He neither took off<br> his hat nor spoke to the others in the room. He had eyes for no<br> one but Melanie and he spoke abruptly without greeting.<br><br> ‘Where have they gone? Tell me quickly. It's life or death.’<br><br> Scarlett and Pitty, startled and bewildered, looked at each other<br> in wonderment and, like a lean old cat, India streaked across the<br> room to Melanie's side.<br><br> ‘Don't tell him anything,’ she cried swiftly. ‘He's a spy, a<br> Scallawag!’<br><br> Rhett did not even favor her with a glance.<br><br> ‘Quickly, Mrs. Wilkes! There may still be time.’<br><br> Melanie seemed in a paralysis of terror and only stared into his<br> face.<br><br> ‘What on earth--’ began Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Shet yore mouth,’ directed Archie briefly. ‘You too, Miss Melly.<br> Git the hell out of here, you damned Scallawag.’<br><br> ‘No, Archie, no!’ cried Melanie and she put a shaking hand on<br> Rhett's arm as though to protect him from Archie. ‘What has<br> happened? How did--how did you know?’<br><br> On Rhett's dark face impatience fought with courtesy.<br><br> ‘Good God, Mrs. Wilkes, they've all been under suspicion since the<br> beginning--only they've been too clever--until tonight! How do I<br> know? I was playing poker tonight with two drunken Yankee captains<br> and they let it out. The Yankees knew there'd be trouble tonight<br> and they've prepared for it. The fools have walked into a trap.’<br><br> For a moment it was as though Melanie swayed under the impact of a<br> heavy blow and Rhett's arm went around her waist to steady her.<br><br> ‘Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!’ cried India, glaring at<br> Rhett. ‘Didn't you hear him say he'd been with Yankee officers<br> tonight?’<br><br> Still Rhett did not look at her. His eyes were bent insistently on<br> Melanie's white face.<br><br> ‘Tell me. Where did they go? Have they a meeting place?’<br><br> Despite her fear and incomprehension, Scarlett thought she had<br> never seen a blanker, more expressionless face than Rhett's but<br> evidently Melanie saw something else, something that made her give<br> her trust. She straightened her small body away from the steadying<br> arm and said quietly but with a voice that shook:<br><br> ‘Out the Decatur road near Shantytown. They meet in the cellar of<br> the old Sullivan plantation--the one that's half-burned.’<br><br> ‘Thank you. I'll ride fast. When the Yankees come here, none of<br> you know anything.’<br><br> He was gone so swiftly, his black cape melting into the night, that<br> they could hardly realize he had been there at all until they heard<br> the spattering of gravel and the mad pounding of a horse going off<br> at full gallop.<br><br> ‘The Yankees coming here?’ cried Pitty and, her small feet turning<br> under her, she collapsed on the sofa, too frightened for tears.<br><br> ‘What's it all about? What did he mean? If you don't tell me I'll<br> go crazy!’ Scarlett laid hands on Melanie and shook her violently<br> as if by force she could shake an answer from her.<br><br> ‘Mean? It means you've probably been the cause of Ashley's and Mr.<br> Kennedy's death!’ In spite of the agony of fear there was a note<br> of triumph in India's voice. ‘Stop shaking Melly. She's going to<br> faint.’<br><br> ‘No, I'm not,’ whispered Melanie, clutching the back of a chair.<br><br> ‘My God, my God! I don't understand! Kill Ashley? Please,<br> somebody tell me--’<br><br> Archie's voice, like a rusty hinge, cut through Scarlett's words.<br><br> ‘Set down,’ he ordered briefly. ‘Pick up yore sewin'. Sew like<br> nothin' had happened. For all we know, the Yankees might have been<br> spyin' on this house since sundown. Set down, I say, and sew.’<br><br> Trembling they obeyed, even Pitty picking up a sock and holding it<br> in shaking fingers while her eyes, wide as a frightened child's<br> went around the circle for an explanation.<br><br> ‘Where is Ashley? What has happened to him, Melly?’ cried<br> Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Where's your husband? Aren't you interested in him?’ India's<br> pale eyes blazed with insane malice as she crumpled and<br> straightened the torn towel she had been mending.<br><br> ‘India, please!’ Melanie had mastered her voice but her white,<br> shaken face and tortured eyes showed the strain under which she was<br> laboring. ‘Scarlett, perhaps we should have told you but--but--you<br> had been through so much this afternoon that we--that Frank didn't<br> think--and you were always so outspoken against the Klan--’<br><br> ‘The Klan--’<br><br> At first, Scarlett spoke the word as if she had never heard it<br> before and had no comprehension of its meaning and then:<br><br> ‘The Klan!’ she almost screamed it. ‘Ashley isn't in the Klan!<br> Frank can't be! Oh, he promised me!’<br><br> ‘Of course, Mr. Kennedy is in the Klan and Ashley, too, and all the<br> men we know,’ cried India. ‘They are men, aren't they? And white<br> men and Southerners. You should have been proud of him instead of<br> making him sneak out as though it were something shameful and--’<br><br> ‘You all have known all along and I didn't--’<br><br> ‘We were afraid it would upset you,’ said Melanie sorrowfully.<br><br> ‘Then that's where they go when they're supposed to be at the<br> political meetings? Oh, he promised me! Now, the Yankees will<br> come and take my mills and the store and put him in jail--oh, what<br> did Rhett Butler mean?’<br><br> India's eyes met Melanie's in wild fear. Scarlett rose, flinging<br> her sewing down.<br><br> ‘If you don't tell me, I'm going downtown and find out. I'll ask<br> everybody I see until I find--’<br><br> ‘Set,’ said Archie, fixing her with his eye. ‘I'll tell you.<br> Because you went gallivantin' this afternoon and got yoreself into<br> trouble through yore own fault, Mr. Wilkes and Mr. Kennedy and the<br> other men are out tonight to kill that thar nigger and that thar<br> white man, if they can catch them, and wipe out that whole<br> Shantytown settlement. And if what that Scallawag said is true,<br> the Yankees suspected sumpin' or got wind somehow and they've sont<br> out troops to lay for them. And our men have walked into a trap.<br> And if what Butler said warn't true, then he's a spy and he is<br> goin' to turn them up to the Yankees and they'll git kilt just the<br> same. And if he does turn them up, then I'll kill him, if it's the<br> last deed of m' life. And if they ain't kilt, then they'll all<br> have to light out of here for Texas and lay low and maybe never<br> come back. It's all yore fault and thar's blood on yore hands.’<br><br> Anger wiped out the fear from Melanie's face as she saw<br> comprehension come slowly across Scarlett's face and then horror<br> follow swiftly. She rose and put her hand on Scarlett's shoulder.<br><br> ‘Another such word and you go out of this house, Archie,’ she said<br> sternly. ‘It's not her fault. She only did--did what she felt she<br> had to do. And our men did what they felt they had to do. People<br> must do what they must do. We don't all think alike or act alike<br> and it's wrong to--to judge others by ourselves. How can you and<br> India say such cruel things when her husband as well as mine may<br> be--may be--’<br><br> ‘Hark!’ interrupted Archie softly. ‘Set, Ma'm. Thar's horses.’<br><br> Melanie sank into a chair, picked up one of Ashley's shirts and,<br> bowing her head over it, unconsciously began to tear the frills<br> into small ribbons.<br><br> The sound of hooves grew louder as horses trotted up to the house.<br> There was the jangling of bits and the strain of leather and the<br> sound of voices. As the hooves stopped in front of the house, one<br> voice rose above the others in a command and the listeners heard<br> feet going through the side yard toward the back porch. They felt<br> that a thousand inimical eyes looked at them through the unshaded<br> front window and the four women, with fear in their hearts, bent<br> their heads and plied their needles. Scarlett's heart screamed in<br> her breast: ‘I've killed Ashley! I've killed him!’ And in that<br> wild moment she did not even think that she might have killed Frank<br> too. She had no room in her mind for any picture save that of<br> Ashley, lying at the feet of Yankee cavalrymen, his fair hair<br> dappled with blood.<br><br> As the harsh rapid knocking sounded at the door, she looked at<br> Melanie and saw come over the small, strained face a new<br> expression, an expression as blank as she had just seen on Rhett<br> Butler's face, the bland blank look of a poker player bluffing a<br> game with only two deuces.<br><br> ‘Archie, open the door,’ she said quietly.<br><br> Slipping his knife into his boot top and loosening the pistol in<br> his trouser band, Archie stumped over to the door and flung it<br> open. Pitty gave a little squeak, like a mouse who feels the trap<br> snap down, as she saw massed in the doorway, a Yankee captain and a<br> squad of bluecoats. But the others said nothing. Scarlett saw<br> with the faintest feeling of relief that she knew this officer. He<br> was Captain Tom Jaffery, one of Rhett's friends. She had sold him<br> lumber to build his house. She knew him to be a gentleman.<br> Perhaps, as he was a gentleman, he wouldn't drag them away to<br> prison. He recognized her instantly and, taking off his hat,<br> bowed, somewhat embarrassed.<br><br> ‘Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy. And which of you ladies is Mrs.<br> Wilkes?’<br><br> ‘I am Mrs. Wilkes,’ answered Melanie, rising and for all her<br> smallness, dignity flowed from her. ‘And to what do I owe this<br> intrusion?’<br><br> The eyes of the captain flickered quickly about the room, resting<br> for an instant on each face, passing quickly from their faces to<br> the table and the hat rack as though looking for signs of male<br> occupancy.<br><br> ‘I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes and Mr. Kennedy, if you<br> please.’<br><br> ‘They are not here,’ said Melanie, a chill in her soft voice.<br><br> ‘Are you sure?’<br><br> ‘Don't you question Miz Wilkes' word,’ said Archie, his beard<br> bristling.<br><br> ‘I beg your pardon, Mrs. Wilkes. I meant no disrespect. If you<br> give me your word, I will not search the house.’<br><br> ‘You have my word. But search if you like. They are at a meeting<br> downtown at Mr. Kennedy's store.’<br><br> ‘They are not at the store. There was no meeting tonight,’<br> answered the captain grimly. ‘We will wait outside until they<br> return.’<br><br> He bowed briefly and went out, closing the door behind him. Those<br> in the house heard a sharp order, muffled by the wind: ‘Surround<br> the house. A man at each window and door.’ There was a tramping<br> of feet. Scarlett checked a start of terror as she dimly saw<br> bearded faces peering in the windows at them. Melanie sat down and<br> with a hand that did not tremble reached for a book on the table.<br> It was a ragged copy of Les Miserables, that book which caught the<br> fancy of the Confederate soldiers. They had read it by camp-fire<br> light and took some grim pleasure in calling it ‘Lee's Miserables.’<br> She opened it at the middle and began to read in a clear monotonous<br> voice.<br><br> ‘Sew,’ commanded Archie in a hoarse whisper and the three women,<br> nerved by Melanie's cool voice, picked up their sewing and bowed<br> their heads.<br><br> How long Melanie read beneath that circle of watching eyes,<br> Scarlett never knew but it seemed hours. She did not even hear a<br> word that Melanie read. Now she was beginning to think of Frank as<br> well as Ashley. So this was the explanation of his apparent calm<br> this evening! He had promised her he would have nothing to do with<br> the Klan. Oh, this was just the kind of trouble she had feared<br> would come upon them! All the work of this last year would go for<br> nothing. All her struggles and fears and labors in rain and cold<br> had been wasted. And who would have thought that spiritless old<br> Frank would get himself mixed up in the hot-headed doings of the<br> Klan? Even at this minute, he might be dead. And if he wasn't<br> dead and the Yankees caught him, he'd be hanged. And Ashley, too!<br><br> Her nails dug into her palms until four bright-red crescents<br> showed. How could Melanie read on and on so calmly when Ashley was<br> in danger of being hanged? When he might be dead? But something<br> in the cool soft voice reading the sorrows of Jean Valjean steadied<br> her, kept her from leaping to her feet and screaming.<br><br> Her mind fled back to the night Tony Fontaine had come to them,<br> hunted, exhausted, without money. If he had not reached their<br> house and received money and a fresh horse, he would have been<br> hanged long since. If Frank and Ashley were not dead at this very<br> minute, they were in Tony's position, only worse. With the house<br> surrounded by soldiers they couldn't come home and get money and<br> clothes without being captured. And probably every house up and<br> down the street had a similar guard of Yankees, so they could not<br> apply to friends for aid. Even now they might be riding wildly<br> through the night, bound for Texas.<br><br> But Rhett--perhaps Rhett had reached them in time. Rhett always<br> had plenty of cash in his pocket. Perhaps he would lend them<br> enough to see them through. But that was queer. Why should Rhett<br> bother himself about Ashley's safety? Certainly he disliked him,<br> certainly he professed a contempt for him. Then why-- But this<br> riddle was swallowed up in a renewed fear for the safety of Ashley<br> and Frank.<br><br> ‘Oh, it's all my fault!’ she wailed to herself. ‘India and Archie<br> spoke the truth. It's all my fault. But I never thought either of<br> them was foolish enough to join the Klan! And I never thought<br> anything would really happen to me! But I couldn't have done<br> otherwise. Melly spoke the truth. People have to do what they<br> have to do. And I had to keep the mills going! I had to have<br> money! And now I'll probably lose it all and somehow it's all my<br> fault!’<br><br> After a long time Melanie's voice faltered, trailed off and was<br> silent. She turned her head toward the window and stared as though<br> no Yankee soldier stared back from behind the glass. The others<br> raised their heads, caught by her listening pose, and they too<br> listened.<br><br> There was a sound of horses' feet and of singing, deadened by the<br> closed windows and doors, borne away by the wind but still<br> recognizable. It was the most hated and hateful of all songs, the<br> song about Sherman's men ‘Marching through Georgia’ and Rhett<br> Butler was singing it.<br><br> Hardly had he finished the first lines when two other voices,<br> drunken voices, assailed him, enraged foolish voices that stumbled<br> over words and blurred them together. There was a quick command<br> from Captain Jaffery on the front porch and the rapid tramp of<br> feet. But even before these sounds arose, the ladies looked at one<br> another stunned. For the drunken voices expostulating with Rhett<br> were those of Ashley and Hugh Elsing.<br><br> Voices rose louder on the front walk, Captain Jaffery's curt and<br> questioning, Hugh's shrill with foolish laughter, Rhett's deep and<br> reckless and Ashley's queer, unreal, shouting: ‘What the hell!<br> What the hell!’<br><br> ‘That can't be Ashley!’ thought Scarlett wildly. ‘He never gets<br> drunk! And Rhett--why, when Rhett's drunk he gets quieter and<br> quieter--never loud like that!’<br><br> Melanie rose and, with her, Archie rose. They heard the captain's<br> sharp voice: ‘These two men are under arrest.’ And Archie's hand<br> closed over his pistol butt.<br><br> ‘No,’ whispered Melanie firmly. ‘No. Leave it to me.’ There was<br> in her face the same look Scarlett had seen that day at Tara when<br> Melanie had stood at the top of the steps looking down at the dead<br> Yankee, her weak wrist weighed down by the heavy saber--a gentle<br> and timid soul nerved by circumstances to the caution and fury of a<br> tigress. She threw the front door open.<br><br> ‘Bring him in, Captain Butler,’ she called in a clear tone that bit<br> with venom. ‘I suppose you've gotten him intoxicated again. Bring<br> him in.’<br><br> From the dark windy walk, the Yankee captain spoke: ‘I'm sorry,<br> Mrs. Wilkes, but your husband and Mr. Elsing are under arrest.’<br><br> ‘Arrest? For what? For drunkenness? If everyone in Atlanta was<br> arrested for drunkenness, the whole Yankee garrison would be in<br> jail continually. Well, bring him in, Captain Butler--that is, if<br> you can walk yourself.’<br><br> Scarlett's mind was not working quickly and for a brief moment<br> nothing made sense. She knew neither Rhett nor Ashley was drunk<br> and she knew Melanie knew they were not drunk. Yet here was<br> Melanie, usually so gentle and refined, screaming like a shrew and<br> in front of Yankees too, that both of them were too drunk to walk.<br><br> There was a short mumbled argument, punctuated with curses, and<br> uncertain feet ascended the stairs. In the doorway appeared<br> Ashley, white faced, his head lolling, his bright hair tousled, his<br> long body wrapped from neck to knees in Rhett's black cape. Hugh<br> Elsing and Rhett, none too steady on their feet, supported him on<br> either side and it was obvious he would have fallen to the floor<br> but for their aid. Behind them came the Yankee captain, his face a<br> study of mingled suspicion and amusement. He stood in the open<br> doorway with his men peering curiously over his shoulders and the<br> cold wind swept the house.<br><br> Scarlett, frightened, puzzled, glanced at Melanie and back to the<br> sagging Ashley and then half-comprehension came to her. She<br> started to cry out: ‘But he can't be drunk!’ and bit back the<br> words. She realized she was witnessing a play, a desperate play on<br> which lives hinged. She knew she was not part of it nor was Aunt<br> Pitty but the others were and they were tossing cues to one another<br> like actors in an oft-rehearsed drama. She understood only half<br> but she understood enough to keep silent.<br><br> ‘Put him in the chair,’ cried Melanie indignantly. ‘And you,<br> Captain Butler, leave this house immediately! How dare you show<br> your face here after getting him in this condition again!’<br><br> The two men eased Ashley into a rocker and Rhett, swaying, caught<br> hold of the back of the chair to steady himself and addressed the<br> captain with pain in his voice.<br><br> ‘That's fine thanks I get, isn't it? For keeping the police from<br> getting him and bringing him home and him yelling and trying to<br> claw me!’<br><br> ‘And you, Hugh Elsing, I'm ashamed of you! What will your poor<br> mother say? Drunk and out with a--a Yankee-loving Scallawag like<br> Captain Butler! And, oh, Mr. Wilkes, how could you do such a<br> thing?’<br><br> ‘Melly, I ain't so very drunk,’ mumbled Ashley, and with the words<br> fell forward and lay face down on the table, his head buried in his<br> arms.<br><br> ‘Archie, take him to his room and put him to bed--as usual,’<br> ordered Melanie. ‘Aunt Pitty, please run and fix the bed and oo-<br> oh,’ she suddenly burst into tears. ‘Oh, how could he? After he<br> promised!’<br><br> Archie already had his arm under Ashley's shoulder and Pitty,<br> frightened and uncertain, was on her feet when the captain<br> interposed.<br><br> ‘Don't touch him. He's under arrest. Sergeant!’<br><br> As the sergeant stepped into the room, his rifle at trail, Rhett,<br> evidently trying to steady himself, put a hand on the captain's arm<br> and, with difficulty, focused his eyes.<br><br> ‘Tom, what you arresting him for? He ain't so very drunk. I've<br> seen him drunker.’<br><br> ‘Drunk be damned,’ cried the captain. ‘He can lie in the gutter<br> for all I care. I'm no policeman. He and Mr. Elsing are under<br> arrest for complicity in a Klan raid at Shantytown tonight. A<br> nigger and a white man were killed. Mr. Wilkes was the ringleader<br> in it.’<br><br> ‘Tonight?’ Rhett began to laugh. He laughed so hard that he sat<br> down on the sofa and put his head in his hands. ‘Not tonight,<br> Tom,’ he said when he could speak. ‘These two have been with me<br> tonight--ever since eight o'clock when they were supposed to be at<br> the meeting.’<br><br> ‘With you, Rhett? But--’ A frown came over the captain's forehead<br> and he looked uncertainly at the snoring Ashley and his weeping<br> wife. ‘But--where were you?’<br><br> ‘I don't like to say,’ and Rhett shot a look of drunken cunning at<br> Melanie.<br><br> ‘You'd better say!’<br><br> ‘Le's go out on the porch and I'll tell you where we were.’<br><br> ‘You'll tell me now.’<br><br> ‘Hate to say it in front of ladies. If you ladies'll step out of<br> the room--’<br><br> ‘I won't go,’ cried Melanie, dabbing angrily at her eyes with her<br> handkerchief. ‘I have a right to know. Where was my husband?’<br><br> ‘At Belle Watling's sporting house,’ said Rhett, looking abashed.<br> ‘He was there and Hugh and Frank Kennedy and Dr. Meade and--and a<br> whole lot of them. Had a party. Big party. Champagne. Girls--’<br><br> ‘At--at Belle Watling's?’<br><br> Melanie's voice rose until it cracked with such pain that all eyes<br> turned frightenedly to her. Her hand went clutching at her bosom<br> and, before Archie could catch her, she had fainted. Then a hubbub<br> ensued, Archie picking her up, India running to the kitchen for<br> water, Pitty and Scarlett fanning her and slapping her wrists,<br> while Hugh Elsing shouted over and over: ‘Now you've done it! Now<br> you've done it!’<br><br> ‘Now it'll be all over town,’ said Rhett savagely. ‘I hope you're<br> satisfied, Tom. There won't be a wife in Atlanta who'll speak to<br> her husband tomorrow.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, I had no idea--’ Though the chill wind was blowing through<br> the open door on his back, the captain was perspiring. ‘Look here!<br> You take an oath they were at--er--at Belle's?’<br><br> ‘Hell, yes,’ growled Rhett. ‘Go ask Belle herself if you don't<br> believe me. Now, let me carry Mrs. Wilkes to her room. Give her<br> to me, Archie. Yes, I can carry her. Miss Pitty, go ahead with a<br> lamp.’<br><br> He took Melanie's limp body from Archie's arms with ease.<br><br> ‘You get Mr. Wilkes to bed, Archie. I don't want to ever lay eyes<br> or hands on him again after this night.’<br><br> Pitty's hand trembled so that the lamp was a menace to the safety<br> of the house but she held it and trotted ahead toward the dark<br> bedroom. Archie, with a grunt, got an arm under Ashley and raised<br> him.<br><br> ‘But--I've got to arrest these men!’<br><br> Rhett turned in the dim hallway.<br><br> ‘Arrest them in the morning then. They can't run away in this<br> condition--and I never knew before that it was illegal to get drunk<br> in a sporting house. Good God, Tom, there are fifty witnesses to<br> prove they were at Belle's.’<br><br> ‘There are always fifty witnesses to prove a Southerner was<br> somewhere he wasn't,’ said the captain morosely. ‘You come with<br> me, Mr. Elsing. I'll parole Mr. Wilkes on the word of--’<br><br> ‘I am Mr. Wilkes' sister. I will answer for his appearance,’ said<br> India coldly. ‘Now, will you please go? You've caused enough<br> trouble for one night.’<br><br> ‘I regret it exceedingly.’ The captain bowed awkwardly. ‘I only<br> hope they can prove their presence at the--er--Miss--Mrs. Watling's<br> house. Will you tell your brother that he must appear before the<br> provost marshal tomorrow morning for questioning?’<br><br> India bowed coldly and, putting her hand upon the door knob,<br> intimated silently that his speedy retirement would be welcome.<br> The captain and the sergeant backed out, Hugh Elsing with them, and<br> she slammed the door behind them. Without even looking at<br> Scarlett, she went swiftly to each window and drew down the shade.<br> Scarlett, her knees shaking, caught hold of the chair in which<br> Ashley had been sitting to steady herself. Looking down at it, she<br> saw that there was a dark moist spot, larger than her hand, on the<br> cushion in the back of the chair. Puzzled, her hand went over it<br> and, to her horror, a sticky red wetness appeared on her palm.<br><br> ‘India,’ she whispered, ‘India, Ashley's--he's hurt.’<br><br> ‘You fool! Did you think he was really drunk?’<br><br> India snapped down the last shade and started on flying feet for<br> the bedroom, with Scarlett close behind her, her heart in her<br> throat. Rhett's big body barred the doorway but, past his<br> shoulder, Scarlett saw Ashley lying white and still on the bed.<br> Melanie, strangely quick for one so recently in a faint, was<br> rapidly cutting off his blood-soaked shirt with embroidery<br> scissors. Archie held the lamp low over the bed to give light and<br> one of his gnarled fingers was on Ashley's wrist.<br><br> ‘Is he dead?’ cried both girls together.<br><br> ‘No, just fainted from loss of blood. It's through his shoulder,’<br> said Rhett.<br><br> ‘Why did you bring him here, you fool?’ cried India. ‘Let me get<br> to him! Let me pass! Why did you bring him here to be arrested?’<br><br> ‘He was too weak to travel. There was nowhere else to bring him,<br> Miss Wilkes. Besides--do you want him to be an exile like Tony<br> Fontaine? Do you want a dozen of your neighbors to live in Texas<br> under assumed names for the rest of their lives? There's a chance<br> that we may get them all off if Belle--’<br><br> ‘Let me pass!’<br><br> ‘No, Miss Wilkes. There's work for you. You must go for a doctor--<br> Not Dr. Meade. He's implicated in this and is probably explaining<br> to the Yankees at this very minute. Get some other doctor. Are you<br> afraid to go out alone at night?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said India, her pale eyes glittering. ‘I'm not afraid.’ She<br> caught up Melanie's hooded cape which was hanging on a hook in the<br> hall. ‘I'll go for old Dr. Dean.’ The excitement went out of her<br> voice as, with an effort, she forced calmness. ‘I'm sorry I called<br> you a spy and a fool. I did not understand. I'm deeply grateful<br> for what you've done for Ashley--but I despise you just the same.’<br><br> ‘I appreciate frankness--and I thank you for it.’ Rhett bowed and<br> his lip curled down in an amused smile. ‘Now, go quickly and by<br> back ways and when you return do not come in this house if you see<br> signs of soldiers about.’<br><br> India shot one more quick anguished look at Ashley, and, wrapping<br> her cape about her, ran lightly down the hall to the back door and<br> let herself out quietly into the night.<br><br> Scarlett, straining her eyes past Rhett, felt her heart beat again<br> as she saw Ashley's eyes open. Melanie snatched a folded towel<br> from the washstand rack and pressed it against his streaming<br> shoulder and he smiled up weakly, reassuringly into her face.<br> Scarlett felt Rhett's hard penetrating eyes upon her, knew that her<br> heart was plain upon her face, but she did not care. Ashley was<br> bleeding, perhaps dying and she who loved him had torn that hole<br> through his shoulder. She wanted to run to the bed, sink down<br> beside it and clasp him to her but her knees trembled so that she<br> could not enter the room. Hand at her mouth, she stared while<br> Melanie packed a fresh towel against his shoulder, pressing it hard<br> as though she could force back the blood into his body. But the<br> towel reddened as though by magic.<br><br> How could a man bleed so much and still live? But, thank God,<br> there was no bubble of blood at his lips--oh, those frothy red<br> bubbles, forerunners of death that she knew so well from the<br> dreadful day of the battle at Peachtree Creek when the wounded had<br> died on Aunt Pitty's lawn with bloody mouths.<br><br> ‘Brace up,’ said Rhett, and there was a hard, faintly jeering note<br> in his voice. ‘He won't die. Now, go take the lamp and hold it<br> for Mrs. Wilkes. I need Archie to run errands.’<br><br> Archie looked across the lamp at Rhett.<br><br> ‘I ain't takin' no orders from you,’ he said briefly, shifting his<br> wad of tobacco to the other cheek.<br><br> ‘You do what he says,’ said Melanie sternly, ‘and do it quickly.<br> Do everything Captain Butler says. Scarlett, take the lamp.’<br><br> Scarlett went forward and took the lamp, holding it in both hands<br> to keep from dropping it. Ashley's eyes had closed again. His<br> bare chest heaved up slowly and sank quickly and the red stream<br> seeped from between Melanie's small frantic fingers. Dimly she<br> heard Archie stump across the room to Rhett and heard Rhett's low<br> rapid words. Her mind was so fixed upon Ashley that of the first<br> half-whispered words of Rhett, she only heard: ‘Take my horse . . .<br> tied outside . . . ride like hell.’<br><br> Archie mumbled some question and Scarlett heard Rhett reply: ‘The<br> old Sullivan plantation. You'll find the robes pushed up the<br> biggest chimney. Burn them.’<br><br> ‘Um,’ grunted Archie.<br><br> ‘And there's two--men in the cellar. Pack them over the horse as<br> best you can and take them to that vacant lot behind Belle's--the<br> one between her house and the railroad tracks. Be careful. If<br> anyone sees you, you'll hang as well as the rest of us. Put them<br> in that lot and put pistols near them--in their hands. Here--take<br> mine.’<br><br> Scarlett, looking across the room, saw Rhett reach under his coat<br> tails and produce two revolvers which Archie took and shoved into<br> his waist band.<br><br> ‘Fire one shot from each. It's got to appear like a plain case of<br> shooting. You understand?’<br><br> Archie nodded as if he understood perfectly and an unwilling gleam<br> of respect shone in his cold eye. But understanding was far from<br> Scarlett. The last half-hour had been so nightmarish that she felt<br> nothing would ever be plain and clear again. However, Rhett seemed<br> in perfect command of the bewildering situation and that was a<br> small comfort.<br><br> Archie turned to go and then swung about and his one eye went<br> questioningly to Rhett's face.<br><br> ‘Him?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> Archie grunted and spat on the floor.<br><br> ‘Hell to pay,’ he said as he stumped down the hall to the back<br> door.<br><br> Something in the last low interchange of words made a new fear and<br> suspicion rise up in Scarlett's breast like a chill ever-swelling<br> bubble. When that bubble broke--<br><br> ‘Where's Frank?’ she cried.<br><br> Rhett came swiftly across the room to the bed, his big body<br> swinging as lightly and noiselessly as a cat's.<br><br> ‘All in good time,’ he said and smiled briefly. ‘Steady that lamp,<br> Scarlett. You don't want to burn Mr. Wilkes up. Miss Melly--’<br><br> Melanie looked up like a good little soldier awaiting a command and<br> so tense was the situation it did not occur to her that for the<br> first time Rhett was calling her familiarly by the name which only<br> family and old friends used.<br><br> ‘I beg your pardon, I mean, Mrs. Wilkes. . . .’<br><br> ‘Oh, Captain Butler, do not ask my pardon! I should feel honored<br> if you called me 'Melly' without the Miss! I feel as though you<br> were my--my brother or--or my cousin. How kind you are and how<br> clever! How can I ever thank you enough?’<br><br> ‘Thank you,’ said Rhett and for a moment he looked almost<br> embarrassed. ‘I should never presume so far, but Miss Melly,’ and<br> his voice was apologetic, ‘I'm sorry I had to say that Mr. Wilkes<br> was in Belle Watling's house. I'm sorry to have involved him and<br> the others in such a--a-- But I had to think fast when I rode away<br> from here and that was the only plan that occurred to me. I knew<br> my word would be accepted because I have so many friends among the<br> Yankee officers. They do me the dubious honor of thinking me<br> almost one of them because they know my--shall we call it my<br> 'unpopularity'?--among my townsmen. And you see, I was playing<br> poker in Belle's bar earlier in the evening. There are a dozen<br> Yankee soldiers who can testify to that. And Belle and her girls<br> will gladly lie themselves black in the face and say Mr. Wilkes and<br> the others were--upstairs all evening. And the Yankees will<br> believe them. Yankees are queer that way. It won't occur to them<br> that women of--their profession are capable of intense loyalty or<br> patriotism. The Yankees wouldn't take the word of a single nice<br> Atlanta lady as to the whereabouts of the men who were supposed to<br> be at the meeting tonight but they will take the word of--fancy<br> ladies. And I think that between the word of honor of a Scallawag<br> and a dozen fancy ladies, we may have a chance of getting the men<br> off.’<br><br> There was a sardonic grin on his face at the last words but it<br> faded as Melanie turned up to him a face that blazed with<br> gratitude.<br><br> ‘Captain Butler, you are so smart! I wouldn't have cared if you'd<br> said they were in hell itself tonight, if it saves them! For I<br> know and every one else who matters knows that my husband was never<br> in a dreadful place like that!’<br><br> ‘Well--’ began Rhett awkwardly, ‘as a matter of fact, he was at<br> Belle's tonight.’<br><br> Melanie drew herself up coldly.<br><br> ‘You can never make me believe such a lie!’<br><br> ‘Please, Miss Melly! Let me explain! When I got out to the old<br> Sullivan place tonight, I found Mr. Wilkes wounded and with him<br> were Hugh Elsing and Dr. Meade and old man Merriwether--’<br><br> ‘Not the old gentleman!’ cried Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Men are never too old to be fools. And your Uncle Henry--’<br><br> ‘Oh, mercy!’ cried Aunt Pitty.<br><br> ‘The others had scattered after the brush with the troops and the<br> crowd that stuck together had come to the Sullivan place to hide<br> their robes in the chimney and to see how badly Mr. Wilkes was<br> hurt. But for his wound, they'd be headed for Texas by now--all of<br> them--but he couldn't ride far and they wouldn't leave him. It was<br> necessary to prove that they had been somewhere instead of where<br> they had been, and so I took them by back ways to Belle Watling's.’<br><br> ‘Oh--I see. I do beg your pardon for my rudeness, Captain Butler.<br> I see now it was necessary to take them there but-- Oh, Captain<br> Butler, people must have seen you going in!’<br><br> ‘No one saw us. We went in through a private back entrance that<br> opens on the railroad tracks. It's always dark and locked.’<br><br> ‘Then how--?’<br><br> ‘I have a key,’ said Rhett laconically, and his eyes met Melanie's<br> evenly.<br><br> As the full impact of the meaning smote her, Melanie became so<br> embarrassed that she fumbled with the bandage until it slid off the<br> wound entirely.<br><br> ‘I did not mean to pry--’ she said in a muffled voice, her white<br> face reddening, as she hastily pressed the towel back into place.<br><br> ‘I regret having to tell a lady such a thing.’<br><br> ‘Then it's true!’ thought Scarlett with an odd pang. ‘Then he does<br> live with that dreadful Watling creature! He does own her house!’<br><br> ‘I saw Belle and explained to her. We gave her a list of the men<br> who were out tonight and she and her girls will testify that they<br> were all in her house tonight. Then to make our exit more<br> conspicuous, she called the two desperadoes who keep order at her<br> place and had us dragged downstairs, fighting, and through the<br> barroom and thrown out into the street as brawling drunks who were<br> disturbing the place.’<br><br> He grinned reminiscently. ‘Dr. Meade did not make a very<br> convincing drunk. It hurt his dignity to even be in such a place.<br> But your Uncle Henry and old man Merriwether were excellent. The<br> stage lost two great actors when they did not take up the drama.<br> They seemed to enjoy the affair. I'm afraid your Uncle Henry has a<br> black eye due to Mr. Merriwether's zeal for his part. He--’<br><br> The back door swung open and India entered, followed by old Dr.<br> Dean, his long white hair tumbled, his worn leather bag bulging<br> under his cape. He nodded briefly but without words to those<br> present and quickly lifted the bandage from Ashley's shoulder.<br><br> ‘Too high for the lung,’ he said. ‘If it hasn't splintered his<br> collar bone it's not so serious. Get me plenty of towels, ladies,<br> and cotton if you have it, and some brandy.’<br><br> Rhett took the lamp from Scarlett and set it on the table as<br> Melanie and India sped about, obeying the doctor's orders.<br><br> ‘You can't do anything here. Come into the parlor by the fire.’<br> He took her arm and propelled her from the room. There was a<br> gentleness foreign to him in both hand and voice. ‘You've had a<br> rotten day, haven't you?’<br><br> She allowed herself to be led into the front room and though she<br> stood on the hearth rug in front of the fire she began to shiver.<br> The bubble of suspicion in her breast was swelling larger now. It<br> was more than a suspicion. It was almost a certainty and a<br> terrible certainty. She looked up into Rhett's immobile face and<br> for a moment she could not speak. Then:<br><br> ‘Was Frank at--Belle Watling's?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> Rhett's voice was blunt.<br><br> ‘Archie's carrying him to the vacant lot near Belle's. He's dead.<br> Shot through the head.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLVI<br><br> <br> Few families in the north end of town slept that night for the news<br> of the disaster to the Klan, and Rhett's stratagem spread swiftly<br> on silent feet as the shadowy form of India Wilkes slipped through<br> back yards, whispered urgently through kitchen doors and slipped<br> away into the windy darkness. And in her path, she left fear and<br> desperate hope.<br><br> From without, houses looked black and silent and wrapped in sleep<br> but, within, voices whispered vehemently into the dawn. Not only<br> those involved in the night's raid but every member of the Klan was<br> ready for flight and in almost every stable along Peachtree Street,<br> horses stood saddled in the darkness, pistols in holsters and food<br> in saddlebags. All that prevented a wholesale exodus was India's<br> whispered message: ‘Captain Butler says not to run. The roads<br> will be watched. He has arranged with that Watling creature--’ In<br> dark rooms men whispered: ‘But why should I trust that damned<br> Scallawag Butler? It may be a trap!’ And women's voices implored:<br> ‘Don't go! If he saved Ashley and Hugh, he may save everybody. If<br> India and Melanie trust him--’ And they half trusted and stayed<br> because there was no other course open to them.<br><br> Earlier in the night, the soldiers had knocked at a dozen doors and<br> those who could not or would not tell where they had been that<br> night were marched off under arrest. Rene Picard and one of Mrs.<br> Merriwether's nephews and the Simmons boys and Andy Bonnell were<br> among those who spent the night in jail. They had been in the ill-<br> starred foray but had separated from the others after the shooting.<br> Riding hard for home they were arrested before they learned of<br> Rhett's plan. Fortunately they all replied, to questions, that<br> where they had been that night was their own business and not that<br> of any damned Yankees. They had been locked up for further<br> questioning in the morning. Old man Merriwether and Uncle Henry<br> Hamilton declared shamelessly that they had spent the evening at<br> Belle Watling's sporting house and when Captain Jaffery remarked<br> irritably that they were too old for such goings on, they wanted to<br> fight him.<br><br> Belle Watling herself answered Captain Jaffery's summons, and<br> before he could make known his mission she shouted that the house<br> was closed for the night. A passel of quarrelsome drunks had<br> called in the early part of the evening and had fought one another,<br> torn the place up, broken her finest mirrors and so alarmed the<br> young ladies that all business had been suspended for the night.<br> But if Captain Jaffery wanted a drink; the bar was still open--<br><br> Captain Jaffery, acutely conscious of the grins of his men and<br> feeling helplessly that he was fighting a mist, declared angrily<br> that he wanted neither the young ladies nor a drink and demanded if<br> Belle knew the names of her destructive customers. Oh, yes, Belle<br> knew them. They were her regulars. They came every Wednesday<br> night and called themselves the Wednesday Democrats, though what<br> they meant by that she neither knew or cared. And if they didn't<br> pay for the damage to the mirrors in the upper hall, she was going<br> to have the law on them. She kept a respectable house and-- Oh,<br> their names? Belle unhesitatingly reeled off the names of twelve<br> under suspicion, Captain Jaffery smiled sourly.<br><br> ‘These damned Rebels are as efficiently organized as our Secret<br> Service,’ he said. ‘You and your girls will have to appear before<br> the provost marshal tomorrow.’<br><br> ‘Will the provost make them pay for my mirrors?’<br><br> ‘To hell with your mirrors! Make Rhett Butler pay for them. He<br> owns the place, doesn't he?’<br><br> Before dawn, every ex-Confederate family in town knew everything.<br> And their negroes, who had been told nothing, knew everything too,<br> by that black grapevine telegraph system which defies white<br> understanding. Everyone knew the details of the raid, the killing<br> of Frank Kennedy and crippled Tommy Wellburn and how Ashley was<br> wounded in carrying Frank's body away.<br><br> Some of the feeling of bitter hatred the women bore Scarlett for<br> her share in the tragedy was mitigated by the knowledge that her<br> husband was dead and she knew it and could not admit it and have<br> the poor comfort of claiming his body. Until morning light<br> disclosed the bodies and the authorities notified her, she must<br> know nothing. Frank and Tommy, pistols in cold hands, lay<br> stiffening among the dead weeds in a vacant lot. And the Yankees<br> would say they killed each other in a common drunken brawl over a<br> girl in Belle's house. Sympathy ran high for Fanny, Tommy's wife,<br> who had just had a baby, but no one could slip through the darkness<br> to see her and comfort her because a squad of Yankees surrounded<br> the house, waiting for Tommy to return. And there was another<br> squad about Aunt Pitty's house, waiting for Frank.<br><br> Before dawn the news had trickled about that the military inquiry<br> would take place that day. The townspeople, heavy eyed from<br> sleeplessness and anxious waiting, knew that the safety of some of<br> their most prominent citizens rested on three things--the ability<br> of Ashley Wilkes to stand on his feet and appear before the<br> military board, as though he suffered nothing more serious than a<br> morning-after headache, the word of Belle Watling that these men<br> had been in her house all evening and the word of Rhett Butler that<br> he had been with them.<br><br> The town writhed at these last two! Belle Watling! To owe their<br> men's lives to her! It was intolerable! Women who had<br> ostentatiously crossed the street when they saw Belle coming,<br> wondered if she remembered and trembled for fear she did. The men<br> felt less humiliation at taking their lives from Belle than the<br> women did, for many of them thought her a good sort. But they were<br> stung that they must owe lives and freedom to Rhett Butler, a<br> speculator and a Scallawag. Belle and Rhett, the town's best-known<br> fancy woman and the town's most hated man. And they must be under<br> obligation to them.<br><br> Another thought that stung them to impotent wrath was the knowledge<br> that the Yankees and Carpetbaggers would laugh. Oh, how they would<br> laugh! Twelve of the town's most prominent citizens revealed as<br> habitual frequenters of Belle Watling's sporting house! Two of<br> them killed in a fight over a cheap little girl, others ejected<br> from the place as too drunk to be tolerated even by Belle and some<br> under arrest, refusing to admit they were there when everyone knew<br> they were there!<br><br> Atlanta was right in fearing that the Yankees would laugh. They<br> had squirmed too long beneath Southern coldness and contempt and<br> now they exploded with hilarity. Officers woke comrades and<br> retailed the news. Husbands roused wives at dawn and told them as<br> much as could be decently told to women. And the women, dressing<br> hastily, knocked on their neighbors' doors and spread the story.<br> The Yankee ladies were charmed with it all and laughed until tears<br> ran down their faces. This was Southern chivalry and gallantry for<br> you! Maybe those women who carried their heads so high and snubbed<br> all attempts at friendliness wouldn't be so uppity, now that<br> everyone knew where their husbands spent their time when they were<br> supposed to be at political meetings. Political meetings! Well,<br> that was funny!<br><br> But even as they laughed, they expressed regret for Scarlett and<br> her tragedy. After all, Scarlett was a lady and one of the few<br> ladies in Atlanta who were nice to Yankees. She had already won<br> their sympathy by the fact that she had to work because her husband<br> couldn't or wouldn't support her properly. Even though her husband<br> was a sorry one, it was dreadful that the poor thing should<br> discover he had been untrue to her. And it was doubly dreadful<br> that his death should occur simultaneously with the discovery of<br> his infidelity. After all, a poor husband was better than no<br> husband at all, and the Yankee ladies decided they'd be extra nice<br> to Scarlett. But the others, Mrs. Meade, Mrs. Merriwether, Mrs.<br> Elsing, Tommy Wellburn's widow and most of all, Mrs. Ashley Wilkes,<br> they'd laugh in their faces every time they saw them. That would<br> teach them a little courtesy.<br><br> Much of the whispering that went on in the dark rooms on the north<br> side of town that night was on this same subject. Atlanta ladies<br> vehemently told their husbands that they did not care a rap what<br> the Yankees thought. But inwardly they felt that running an Indian<br> gantlet would be infinitely preferable to suffering the ordeal of<br> Yankee grins and not being able to tell the truth about their<br> husbands.<br><br> Dr. Meade, beside himself with outraged dignity at the position<br> into which Rhett had jockeyed him and the others, told Mrs. Meade<br> that, but for the fact that it would implicate the others, he would<br> rather confess and be hanged than say he had been at Belle's house.<br><br> ‘It is an insult to you, Mrs. Meade,’ he fumed.<br><br> ‘But everyone will know you weren't there for--for--’<br><br> ‘The Yankees won't know. They'll have to believe it if we save our<br> necks. And they'll laugh. The very thought that anyone will<br> believe it and laugh infuriates me. And it insults you because--my<br> dear, I have always been faithful to you.’<br><br> ‘I know that,’ and in the darkness Mrs. Meade smiled and slipped a<br> thin hand into the doctor's. ‘But I'd rather it were really true<br> than have one hair of your head in danger.’<br><br> ‘Mrs. Meade, do you know what you are saying?’ cried the doctor,<br> aghast at the unsuspected realism of his wife.<br><br> ‘Yes, I know. I've lost Darcy and I've lost Phil and you are all I<br> have and, rather than lose you, I'd have you take up your permanent<br> abode at that place.’<br><br> ‘You are distrait! You cannot know what you are saying.’<br><br> ‘You old fool,’ said Mrs. Meade tenderly and laid her head against<br> his sleeve.<br><br> Dr. Meade fumed into silence and stroked her cheek and then<br> exploded again. ‘And to be under obligation to that Butler man!<br> Hanging would be easy compared to that. No, not even if I owe him<br> my life, can I be polite to him. His insolence is monumental and<br> his shamelessness about his profiteering makes me boil. To owe my<br> life to a man who never went in the army--’<br><br> ‘Melly said he enlisted after Atlanta fell.’<br><br> ‘It's a lie. Miss Melly will believe any plausible scoundrel. And<br> what I can't understand is why he is doing all this--going to all<br> this trouble. I hate to say it but--well, there's always been talk<br> about him and Mrs. Kennedy. I've seen them coming in from rides<br> together too often this last year. He must have done it because of<br> her.’<br><br> ‘If it was because of Scarlett, he wouldn't have lifted his hand.<br> He'd have been glad to see Frank Kennedy hanged. I think it's<br> because of Melly--’<br><br> ‘Mrs. Meade, you can't be insinuating that there's ever been<br> anything between those two!’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't be silly! But she's always been unaccountably fond of<br> him ever since he tried to get Ashley exchanged during the war.<br> And I must say this for him, he never smiles in that nasty-nice way<br> when he's with her. He's just as pleasant and thoughtful as can<br> be--really a different man. You can tell by the way he acts with<br> Melly that he could be decent if he wanted to. Now, my idea of why<br> he's doing all this is--’ She paused. ‘Doctor, you won't like my<br> idea.’<br><br> ‘I don't like anything about this whole affair!’<br><br> ‘Well, I think he did it partly for Melly's sake but mostly because<br> he thought it would be a huge joke on us all. We've hated him so<br> much and showed it so plainly and now he's got us in a fix where<br> all of you have your choice of saying you were at that Watling<br> woman's house and shaming yourself and wives before the Yankees--or<br> telling the truth and getting hanged. And he knows we'll all be<br> under obligation to him and his--mistress and that we'd almost<br> rather be hanged than be obliged to them. Oh, I'll wager he's<br> enjoying it.’<br><br> The doctor groaned. ‘He did look amused when he took us upstairs<br> in that place.’<br><br> ‘Doctor,’ Mrs. Meade hesitated, ‘what did it look like?’<br><br> ‘What are you saying, Mrs. Meade?’<br><br> ‘Her house. What did it look like? Are there cut-glass<br> chandeliers? And red plush curtains and dozens of full-length gilt<br> mirrors? And were the girls--were they unclothed?’<br><br> ‘Good God!’ cried the doctor, thunderstruck, for it had never<br> occurred to him that the curiosity of a chaste woman concerning her<br> unchaste sisters was so devouring. ‘How can you ask such immodest<br> questions? You are not yourself. I will mix you a sedative.’<br><br> ‘I don't want a sedative. I want to know. Oh, dear, this is my<br> only chance to know what a bad house looks like and now you are<br> mean enough not to tell me!’<br><br> ‘I noticed nothing. I assure you I was too embarrassed at finding<br> myself in such a place to take note of my surroundings,’ said the<br> doctor formally, more upset at this unsuspected revelation of his<br> wife's character than he had been by all the previous events of the<br> evening. ‘If you will excuse me now, I will try to get some<br> sleep.’<br><br> ‘Well, go to sleep then,’ she answered, disappointment in her<br> tones. Then as the doctor leaned over to remove his boots, her<br> voice spoke from the darkness with renewed cheerfulness. ‘I<br> imagine Dolly has gotten it all out of old man Merriwether and she<br> can tell me about it.’<br><br> ‘Good Heavens, Mrs. Meade! Do you mean to tell me that nice women<br> talk about such things among them--’<br><br> ‘Oh, go to bed,’ said Mrs. Meade.<br><br> <br><br> It sleeted the next day, but as the wintry twilight drew on the icy<br> particles stopped falling and a cold wind blew. Wrapped in her<br> cloak, Melanie went bewilderedly down her front walk behind a<br> strange negro coachman who had summoned her mysteriously to a<br> closed carriage waiting in front of the house. As she came up to<br> the carriage the door was opened and she saw a woman in the dim<br> interior.<br><br> Leaning closer, peering inside, Melanie questioned: ‘Who is it?<br> Won't you come in the house? It's so cold--’<br><br> ‘Please come in here and set with me a minute, Miz Wilkes,’ came a<br> faintly familiar voice, an embarrassed voice from the depths of the<br> carriage.<br><br> ‘Oh, you're Miss--Mrs.--Watling!’ cried Melanie. ‘I did so want to<br> see you! You must come in the house.’<br><br> ‘I can't do that, Miz Wilkes.’ Belle Watling's voice sounded<br> scandalized. ‘You come in here and set a minute with me.’<br><br> Melanie entered the carriage and the coachman closed the door<br> behind her. She sat down beside Belle and reached for her hand.<br><br> ‘How can I ever thank you enough for what you did today! How can<br> any of us thank you enough!’<br><br> ‘Miz Wilkes, you hadn't ought of sent me that note this mornin'.<br> Not that I wasn't proud to have a note from you but the Yankees<br> might of got it. And as for sayin' you was goin' to call on me to<br> thank me--why, Miz Wilkes, you must of lost your mind! The very<br> idea! I come up here as soon as 'twas dark to tell you you mustn't<br> think of any sech thing. Why, I--why, you--it wouldn't be fittin'<br> at all.’<br><br> ‘It wouldn't be fitting for me to call and thank a kind woman who<br> saved my husband's life?’<br><br> ‘Oh, shucks, Miz Wilkes! You know what I mean!’<br><br> Melanie was silent for a moment, embarrassed by the implication.<br> Somehow this handsome, sedately dressed woman sitting in the<br> darkness of the carriage didn't look and talk as she imagined a bad<br> woman, the Madam of a House, should look and talk. She sounded<br> like--well, a little common and countrified but nice and warm<br> hearted.<br><br> ‘You were wonderful before the provost marshal today, Mrs. Watling!<br> You and the other--your--the young ladies certainly saved our men's<br> lives.’<br><br> ‘Mr. Wilkes was the wonderful one. I don't know how he even stood<br> up and told his story, much less look as cool as he done. He was<br> sure bleedin' like a pig when I seen him last night. Is he goin'<br> to be all right, Miz Wilkes?’<br><br> ‘Yes, thank you. The doctor says it's just a flesh wound, though<br> he did lose a tremendous lot of blood. This morning he was--well,<br> he was pretty well laced with brandy or he'd never have had the<br> strength to go through with it all so well. But it was you, Mrs.<br> Watling, who saved them. When you got mad and talked about the<br> broken mirrors you sounded so--so convincing.’<br><br> ‘Thank you, Ma'm. But I--I thought Captain Butler done mighty fine<br> too,’ said Belle, shy pride in her voice.<br><br> ‘Oh, he was wonderful!’ cried Melanie warmly. ‘The Yankees<br> couldn't help but believe his testimony. He was so smart about the<br> whole affair. I can never thank him enough--or you either! How<br> good and kind you are!’<br><br> ‘Thank you kindly, Miz Wilkes. It was a pleasure to do it. I--I<br> hope it ain't goin' to embarrass you none, me sayin' Mr. Wilkes<br> come regular to my place. He never, you know--’<br><br> ‘Yes, I know. No, it doesn't embarrass me at all. I'm just so<br> grateful to you.’<br><br> ‘I'll bet the other ladies ain't grateful to me,’ said Belle with<br> sudden venom. ‘And I'll bet they ain't grateful to Captain Butler<br> neither. I'll bet they'll hate him just this much more. I'll bet<br> you'll be the only lady who even says thanks to me. I'll bet they<br> won't even look me in the eye when they see me on the street. But<br> I don't care. I wouldn't of minded if all their husbands got hung.<br> But I did mind about Mr. Wilkes. You see I ain't forgot how nice<br> you was to me durin' the war, about the money for the hospital.<br> There ain't never been a lady in this town nice to me like you was<br> and I don't forget a kindness. And I thought about you bein' left<br> a widder with a little boy if Mr. Wilkes got hung and--he's a nice<br> little boy, your boy is, Miz Wilkes. I got a boy myself and so I--’<br><br> ‘Oh, you have? Does he live--er--’<br><br> ‘Oh, no'm! He ain't here in Atlanta. He ain't never been here.<br> He's off at school. I ain't seen him since he was little. I--<br> well, anyway, when Captain Butler wanted me to lie for those men I<br> wanted to know who the men was and when I heard Mr. Wilkes was one<br> I never hesitated. I said to my girls, I said, 'I'll whale the<br> livin' daylights out of you all if you don't make a special point<br> of sayin' you was with Mr. Wilkes all evenin'.’<br><br> ‘Oh!’ said Melanie, still more embarrassed by Belle's offhand<br> reference to her ‘girls.’ ‘Oh, that was--er--kind of you and--of<br> them, too.’<br><br> ‘No more'n you deserve,’ said Belle warmly. ‘But I wouldn't of did<br> it for just anybody. If it had been that Miz Kennedy's husband by<br> hisself, I wouldn't of lifted a finger, no matter what Captain<br> Butler said.’<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘Well, Miz Wilkes, people in my business knows a heap of things.<br> It'd surprise and shock a heap of fine ladies if they had any<br> notion how much we knows about them. And she ain't no good, Miz<br> Wilkes. She kilt her husband and that nice Wellburn boy, same as<br> if she shot them. She caused it all, prancin' about Atlanta by<br> herself, enticin' niggers and trash. Why, not one of my girls--’<br><br> ‘You must not say unkind things about my sister-in-law.’ Melanie<br> stiffened coldly.<br><br> Belle put an eager placating hand on Melanie's arm and then hastily<br> withdrew it.<br><br> ‘Don't freeze me, please, Miz Wilkes. I couldn't stand it after<br> you been so kind and sweet to me. I forgot how you liked her and<br> I'm sorry for what I said. I'm sorry about poor Mr. Kennedy bein'<br> dead too. He was a nice man. I used to buy some of the stuff for<br> my house from him and he always treated me pleasant. But Miz<br> Kennedy--well, she just ain't in the same class with you, Miz<br> Wilkes. She's a mighty cold woman and I can't help it if I think<br> so. . . . When are they goin' to bury Mr. Kennedy?’<br><br> ‘Tomorrow morning. And you are wrong about Mrs. Kennedy. Why,<br> this very minute she's prostrated with grief.’<br><br> ‘Maybe so,’ said Belle with evident disbelief. ‘Well, I got to be<br> goin'. I'm afraid somebody might recognize this carriage if I<br> stayed here longer and that wouldn't do you no good. And, Miz<br> Wilkes, if you ever see me on the street, you--you don't have to<br> speak to me. I'll understand.’<br><br> ‘I shall be proud to speak to you. Proud to be under obligation to<br> you. I hope--I hope we meet again.’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Belle. ‘That wouldn't be fittin'. Good night.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLVII<br><br> <br> Scarlett sat in her bedroom, picking at the supper tray Mammy had<br> brought her, listening to the wind hurling itself out of the night.<br> The house was frighteningly still, quieter even than when Frank had<br> lain in the parlor just a few hours before. Then there had been<br> tiptoeing feet and hushed voices, muffled knocks on the door,<br> neighbors rustling in to whisper sympathy and occasional sobs from<br> Frank's sister who had come up from Jonesboro for the funeral.<br><br> But now the house was cloaked in silence. Although her door was<br> open she could hear no sounds from below stairs. Wade and the baby<br> had been at Melanie's since Frank's body was brought home and she<br> missed the sound of the boy's feet and Ella's gurgling. There was<br> a truce in the kitchen and no sound of quarreling from Peter, Mammy<br> and Cookie floated up to her. Even Aunt Pitty, downstairs in the<br> library, was not rocking her creaking chair in deference to<br> Scarlett's sorrow.<br><br> No one intruded upon her, believing that she wished to be left<br> alone with her grief, but to be left alone was the last thing<br> Scarlett desired. Had it only been grief that companioned her, she<br> could have borne it as she had borne other griefs. But, added to<br> her stunned sense of loss at Frank's death, were fear and remorse<br> and the torment of a suddenly awakened conscience. For the first<br> time in her life she was regretting things she had done, regretting<br> them with a sweeping superstitious fear that made her cast sidelong<br> glances at the bed upon which she had lain with Frank.<br><br> She had killed Frank. She had killed him just as surely as if it<br> had been her finger that pulled the trigger. He had begged her not<br> to go about alone but she had not listened to him. And now he was<br> dead because of her obstinacy. God would punish her for that. But<br> there lay upon her conscience another matter that was heavier and<br> more frightening even than causing his death--a matter which had<br> never troubled her until she looked upon his coffined face. There<br> had been something helpless and pathetic in that still face which<br> had accused her. God would punish her for marrying him when he<br> really loved Suellen. She would have to cower at the seat of<br> judgment and answer for that lie she told him coming back from the<br> Yankee camp in his buggy.<br><br> Useless for her to argue now that the end justified the means, that<br> she was driven into trapping him, that the fate of too many people<br> hung on her for her to consider either his or Suellen's rights and<br> happiness. The truth stood out boldly and she cowered away from<br> it. She had married him coldly and used him coldly. And she had<br> made him unhappy during the last six months when she could have<br> made him very happy. God would punish her for not being nicer to<br> him--punish her for all her bullyings and proddings and storms of<br> temper and cutting remarks, for alienating his friends and shaming<br> him by operating the mills and building the saloon and leasing<br> convicts.<br><br> She had made him very unhappy and she knew it, but he had borne it<br> all like a gentleman. The only thing she had ever done that gave<br> him any real happiness was to present him with Ella. And she knew<br> if she could have kept from having Ella, Ella would never have been<br> born.<br><br> She shivered, frightened, wishing Frank were alive, so she could be<br> nice to him, so very nice to him to make up for it all. Oh, if<br> only God did not seem so furious and vengeful! Oh, if only the<br> minutes did not go by so slowly and the house were not so still!<br> If only she were not so alone!<br><br> If only Melanie were with her, Melanie could calm her fears. But<br> Melanie was at home, nursing Ashley. For a moment Scarlett thought<br> of summoning Pittypat to stand between her and her conscience but<br> she hesitated. Pitty would probably make matters worse, for she<br> honestly mourned Frank. He had been more her contemporary than<br> Scarlett's and she had been devoted to him. He had filled to<br> perfection Pitty's need for ‘a man in the house,’ for he brought<br> her little presents and harmless gossip, jokes and stories, read<br> the paper to her at night and explained topics of the day to her<br> while she mended his socks. She had fussed over him and planned<br> special dishes for him and coddled him during his innumerable<br> colds. Now she missed him acutely and repeated over and over as<br> she dabbed at her red swollen eyes: ‘If only he hadn't gone out<br> with the Klan!’<br><br> If there were only someone who could comfort her, quiet her fears,<br> explain to her just what were these confused fears which made her<br> heart sink with such cold sickness! If only Ashley--but she shrank<br> from the thought. She had almost killed Ashley, just as she had<br> killed Frank. And if Ashley ever knew the real truth about how she<br> lied to Frank to get him, knew how mean she had been to Frank, he<br> could never love her any more. Ashley was so honorable, so<br> truthful, so kind and he saw so straightly, so clearly. If he knew<br> the whole truth, he would understand. Oh, yes, he would understand<br> only too well! But he would never love her any more. So he must<br> never know the truth because he must keep on loving her. How could<br> she live if that secret source of her strength, his love, were<br> taken from her? But what a relief it would be to put her head on<br> his shoulder and cry and unburden her guilty heart!<br><br> The still house with the sense of death heavy upon it pressed about<br> her loneliness until she felt she could not bear it unaided any<br> longer. She arose cautiously, pushed her door half-closed and then<br> dug about in the bottom bureau drawer beneath her underwear. She<br> produced Aunt Pitty's ‘swoon bottle’ of brandy which she had hidden<br> there and held it up to the lamp. It was nearly half-empty.<br> Surely she hadn't drunk that much since last night! She poured a<br> generous amount into her water glass and gulped it down. She would<br> have to put the bottle back in the cellaret before morning, filled<br> to the top with water. Mammy had hunted for it, just before the<br> funeral when the pallbearers wanted a drink, and already the air in<br> the kitchen was electric with suspicion between Mammy, Cookie and<br> Peter.<br><br> The brandy burned with fiery pleasantness. There was nothing like<br> it when you needed it. In fact, brandy was good almost any time,<br> so much better than insipid wine. Why on earth should it be proper<br> for a woman to drink wine and not spirits? Mrs. Merriwether and<br> Mrs. Meade had sniffed her breath most obviously at the funeral and<br> she had seen the triumphant look they had exchanged. The old cats!<br><br> She poured another drink. It wouldn't matter if she did get a<br> little tipsy tonight for she was going to bed soon and she could<br> gargle cologne before Mammy came up to unlace her. She wished she<br> could get as completely and thoughtlessly drunk as Gerald used to<br> get on Court Day. Then perhaps she could forget Frank's sunken<br> face accusing her of ruining his life and then killing him.<br><br> She wondered if everyone in town thought she had killed him.<br> Certainly the people at the funeral had been cold to her. The only<br> people who had put any warmth into their expressions of sympathy<br> were the wives of the Yankee officers with whom she did business.<br> Well, she didn't care what the town said about her. How<br> unimportant that seemed beside what she would have to answer for to<br> God!<br><br> She took another drink at the thought, shuddering as the hot brandy<br> went down her throat. She felt very warm now but still she<br> couldn't get the thought of Frank out of her mind. What fools men<br> were when they said liquor made people forget! Unless she drank<br> herself into insensibility, she'd still see Frank's face as it had<br> looked the last time he begged her not to drive alone, timid,<br> reproachful, apologetic.<br><br> The knocker on the front door hammered with a dull sound that made<br> the still house echo and she heard Aunt Pitty's waddling steps<br> crossing the hall and the door opening. There was the sound of<br> greeting and an indistinguishable murmur. Some neighbor calling to<br> discuss the funeral or to bring a blanc mange. Pitty would like<br> that. She had taken an important and melancholy pleasure in<br> talking to the condolence callers.<br><br> She wondered incuriously who it was and, when a man's voice,<br> resonant and drawling, rose above Pitty's funereal whispering, she<br> knew. Gladness and relief flooded her. It was Rhett. She had not<br> seen him since he broke the news of Frank's death to her, and now<br> she knew, deep in her heart, that he was the one person who could<br> help her tonight.<br><br> ‘I think she'll see me,’ Rhett's voice floated up to her.<br><br> ‘But she is lying down now, Captain Butler, and won't see anyone.<br> Poor child, she is quite prostrated. She--’<br><br> ‘I think she will see me. Please tell her I am going away tomorrow<br> and may be gone some time. It's very important.’<br><br> ‘But--’ fluttered Aunt Pittypat.<br><br> Scarlett ran out into the hall, observing with some astonishment<br> that her knees were a little unsteady, and leaned over the<br> banisters.<br><br> ‘I'll be down terrectly, Rhett,’ she called.<br><br> She had a glimpse of Aunt Pittypat's plump upturned face, her eyes<br> owlish with surprise and disapproval. Now it'll be all over town<br> that I conducted myself most improperly on the day of my husband's<br> funeral, thought Scarlett, as she hurried back to her room and<br> began smoothing her hair. She buttoned her black basque up to the<br> chin and pinned down the collar with Pittypat's mourning brooch. I<br> don't look very pretty she thought, leaning toward the mirror, too<br> white and scared. For a moment her hand went toward the lock box<br> where she kept her rouge hidden but she decided against it. Poor<br> Pittypat would be upset in earnest if she came downstairs pink and<br> blooming. She picked up the cologne bottle and took a large<br> mouthful, carefully rinsed her mouth and then spit into the slop<br> jar.<br><br> She rustled down the stairs toward the two who still stood in the<br> hall, for Pittypat had been too upset by Scarlett's action to ask<br> Rhett to sit down. He was decorously clad in black, his linen<br> frilly and starched, and his manner was all that custom demanded<br> from an old friend paying a call of sympathy on one bereaved. In<br> fact, it was so perfect that it verged on the burlesque, though<br> Pittypat did not see it. He was properly apologetic for disturbing<br> Scarlett and regretted that in his rush of closing up business<br> before leaving town he had been unable to be present at the<br> funeral.<br><br> ‘Whatever possessed him to come?’ wondered Scarlett. ‘He doesn't<br> mean a word he's saying.’<br><br> ‘I hate to intrude on you at this time but I have a matter of<br> business to discuss that will not wait. Something that Mr. Kennedy<br> and I were planning--’<br><br> ‘I didn't know you and Mr. Kennedy had business dealings,’ said<br> Aunt Pittypat, almost indignant that some of Frank's activities<br> were unknown to her.<br><br> ‘Mr. Kennedy was a man of wide interests,’ said Rhett respectfully.<br> ‘Shall we go into the parlor?’<br><br> ‘No!’ cried Scarlett. glancing at the closed folding doors. She<br> could still see the coffin in that room. She hoped she never had<br> to enter it again. Pitty, for once, took a hint, although with<br> none too good grace.<br><br> ‘Do use the library. I must--I must go upstairs and get out the<br> mending. Dear me, I've neglected it so this last week. I declare--’<br><br> She went up the stairs with a backward look of reproach which was<br> noticed by neither Scarlett nor Rhett. He stood aside to let her<br> pass before him into the library.<br><br> ‘What business did you and Frank have?’ she questioned abruptly.<br><br> He came closer and whispered. ‘None at all. I just wanted to get<br> Miss Pitty out of the way.’ He paused as he leaned over her.<br> ‘It's no good, Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘What?’<br><br> ‘The cologne.’<br><br> ‘I'm sure I don't know what you mean.’<br><br> ‘I'm sure you do. You've been drinking pretty heavily.’<br><br> ‘Well, what if I have? Is it any of your business?’<br><br> ‘The soul of courtesy, even in the depths of sorrow. Don't drink<br> alone, Scarlett. People always find it out and it ruins the<br> reputation. And besides, it's a bad business, this drinking alone.<br> What's the matter, honey?’<br><br> He led her to the rosewood sofa and she sat down in silence.<br><br> ‘May I close the doors?’<br><br> She knew if Mammy saw the closed doors she would be scandalized and<br> would lecture and grumble about it for days, but it would be still<br> worse if Mammy should overhear this discussion of drinking,<br> especially in light of the missing brandy bottle. She nodded and<br> Rhett drew the sliding doors together. When he came back and sat<br> down beside her, his dark eyes alertly searching her face, the pall<br> of death receded before the vitality he radiated and the room<br> seemed pleasant and homelike again, the lamps rosy and warm.<br><br> ‘What's the matter, honey?’<br><br> No one in the world could say that foolish word of endearment as<br> caressingly as Rhett, even when he was joking, but he did not look<br> as if he were joking now. She raised tormented eyes to his face<br> and somehow found comfort in the blank inscrutability she saw<br> there. She did not know why this should be, for he was such an<br> unpredictable, callous person. Perhaps it was because, as he often<br> said, they were so much alike. Sometimes she thought that all the<br> people she had ever known were strangers except Rhett.<br><br> ‘Can't you tell me?’ he took her hand, oddly gentle. ‘It's more<br> than old Frank leaving you? Do you need money?’<br><br> ‘Money? God, no! Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.’<br><br> ‘Don't be a goose, Scarlett, you've never been afraid in your<br> life.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, I am afraid!’<br><br> The words bubbled up faster than she could speak them. She could<br> tell him. She could tell Rhett anything. He'd been so bad himself<br> that he wouldn't sit in judgment on her. How wonderful to know<br> someone who was bad and dishonorable and a cheat and a liar, when<br> all the world was filled with people who would not lie to save<br> their souls and who would rather starve than do a dishonorable<br> deed!<br><br> ‘I'm afraid I'll die and go to hell.’<br><br> If he laughed at her she would die, right then. But he did not<br> laugh.<br><br> ‘You are pretty healthy--and maybe there isn't any hell after all.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but there is, Rhett! You know there is!’<br><br> ‘I know there is but it's right here on earth. Not after we die.<br> There's nothing after we die, Scarlett. You are having your hell<br> now.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, that's blasphemous!’<br><br> ‘But singularly comforting. Tell me, why are you going to hell?’<br><br> He was teasing now, she could see the glint in his eyes but she did<br> not mind. His hands felt so warm and strong, so comforting to<br> cling to.<br><br> ‘Rhett, I oughtn't to have married Frank. It was wrong. He was<br> Suellen's beau and he loved her, not me. But I lied to him and<br> told him she was going to marry Tony Fontaine. Oh, how could I<br> have done it?’<br><br> ‘Ah, so that was how it came about! I always wondered.’<br><br> ‘And then I made him so miserable. I made him do all sorts of<br> things he didn't want to do, like making people pay their bills<br> when they really couldn't afford to pay them. And it hurt him so<br> when I ran the mills and built the saloon and leased convicts. He<br> could hardly hold up his head for shame. And Rhett, I killed him.<br> Yes, I did! I didn't know he was in the Klan. I never dreamed he<br> had that much gumption. But I ought to have known. And I killed<br> him.’<br><br> ‘'Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my<br> hand?'‘<br><br> ‘What?’<br><br> ‘No matter. Go on.’<br><br> ‘Go on? That's all. Isn't it enough? I married him, I made him<br> unhappy and I killed him. Oh, my God! I don't see how I could<br> have done it! I lied to him and I married him. It all seemed so<br> right when I did it but now I see how wrong it was. Rhett, it<br> doesn't seem like it was me who did all these things. I was so<br> mean to him but I'm not really mean. I wasn't raised that way.<br> Mother--’ She stopped and swallowed. She had avoided thinking of<br> Ellen all day but she could no longer blot out her image.<br><br> ‘I often wondered what she was like. You seemed to me so like your<br> father.’<br><br> ‘Mother was-- Oh, Rhett, for the first time I'm glad she's dead,<br> so she can't see me. She didn't raise me to be mean. She was so<br> kind to everybody, so good. She'd rather I'd have starved than<br> done this. And I so wanted to be just like her in every way and<br> I'm not like her one bit. I hadn't thought of that--there's been<br> so much else to think about--but I wanted to be like her. I didn't<br> want to be like Pa. I loved him but he was--so--so thoughtless.<br> Rhett, sometimes I did try so hard to be nice to people and kind to<br> Frank, but then the nightmare would come back and scare me so bad<br> I'd want to rush out and just grab money away from people, whether<br> it was mine or not.’<br><br> Tears were streaming unheeded down her face and she clutched his<br> hand so hard that her nails dug into his flesh.<br><br> ‘What nightmare?’ His voice was calm and soothing.<br><br> ‘Oh--I forgot you didn't know. Well, just when I would try to be<br> nice to folks and tell myself that money wasn't everything, I'd go<br> to bed and dream that I was back at Tara right after Mother died,<br> right after the Yankees went through. Rhett, you can't imagine--I<br> get cold when I think about it. I can see how everything is burned<br> and so still and there's nothing to eat. Oh, Rhett, in my dream<br> I'm hungry again.’<br><br> ‘Go on.’<br><br> ‘I'm hungry and everybody, Pa and the girls and the darkies, are<br> starving and they keep saying over and over: 'We're hungry' and<br> I'm so empty it hurts, and so frightened. My mind keeps saying:<br> 'If I ever get out of this, I'll never, never be hungry again' and<br> then the dream goes off into a gray mist and I'm running, running<br> in the mist, running so hard my heart's about to burst and<br> something is chasing me, and I can't breathe but I keep thinking<br> that if I can just get there, I'll be safe. But I don't know where<br> I'm trying to get to. And then I'd wake up and I'd be cold with<br> fright and so afraid that I'd be hungry again. When I wake up from<br> that dream, it seems like there's not enough money in the world to<br> keep me from being afraid of being hungry again. And then Frank<br> would be so mealy mouthed and slow poky that he would make me mad<br> and I'd lose my temper. He didn't understand, I guess, and I<br> couldn't make him understand. I kept thinking that I'd make it up<br> to him some day when we had money and I wasn't so afraid of being<br> hungry. And now he's dead and it's too late. Oh, it seemed so<br> right when I did it but it was all so wrong. If I had it to do<br> over again, I'd do it so differently.’<br><br> ‘Hush,’ he said, disentangling her frantic grip and pulling a clean<br> handkerchief from his pocket. ‘Wipe your face. There is no sense<br> in your tearing yourself to pieces this way.’<br><br> She took the handkerchief and wiped her damp cheeks, a little<br> relief stealing over her as if she had shifted some of her burden<br> to his broad shoulders. He looked so capable and calm and even the<br> slight twist of his mouth was comforting as though it proved her<br> agony and confusion unwarranted.<br><br> ‘Feel better now? Then let's get to the bottom of this. You say<br> if you had it to do over again, you'd do it differently. But would<br> you? Think, now. Would you?’<br><br> ‘Well--’<br><br> ‘No, you'd do the same things again. Did you have any other<br> choice?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Then what are you sorry about?’<br><br> ‘I was so mean and now he's dead.’<br><br> ‘And if he wasn't dead, you'd still be mean. As I understand it,<br> you are not really sorry for marrying Frank and bullying him and<br> inadvertently causing his death. You are only sorry because you<br> are afraid of going to hell. Is that right?’<br><br> ‘Well--that sounds so mixed up.’<br><br> ‘Your ethics are considerably mixed up too. You are in the exact<br> position of a thief who's been caught red handed and isn't sorry he<br> stole but is terribly, terribly sorry he's going to jail.’<br><br> ‘A thief--’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't be so literal! In other words if you didn't have this<br> silly idea that you were damned to hell fire eternal, you'd think<br> you were well rid of Frank.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett!’<br><br> ‘Oh, come! You are confessing and you might as well confess the<br> truth as a decorous lie. Did your--er--conscience bother you much<br> when you offered to--shall we say--part with that jewel which is<br> dearer than life for three hundred dollars?’<br><br> The brandy was spinning in her head now and she felt giddy and a<br> little reckless. What was the use in lying to him? He always<br> seemed to read her mind.<br><br> ‘I really didn't think about God much then--or hell. And when I<br> did think--well, I just reckoned God would understand.’<br><br> ‘But you don't credit God with understanding why you married<br> Frank?’<br><br> ‘Rhett, how can you talk so about God when you know you don't<br> believe there is one?’<br><br> ‘But you believe in a God of Wrath and that's what's important at<br> present. Why shouldn't the Lord understand? Are you sorry you<br> still own Tara and there aren't Carpetbaggers living there? Are<br> you sorry you aren't hungry and ragged?’<br><br> ‘Oh, no!’<br><br> ‘Well, did you have any alternative except marrying Frank?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘He didn't have to marry you, did he? Men are free agents. And he<br> didn't have to let you bully him into doing things he didn't want<br> to, did he?’<br><br> ‘Well--’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, why worry about it? If you had it to do over again you<br> would be driven to the lie and he to marrying you. You would still<br> have run yourself into danger and he would have had to avenge you.<br> If he had married Sister Sue, she might not have caused his death<br> but she'd probably have made him twice as unhappy as you did. It<br> couldn't have happened differently.’<br><br> ‘But I could have been nicer to him.’<br><br> ‘You could have been--if you'd been somebody else. But you were<br> born to bully anyone who'll let you do it. The strong were made to<br> bully and the weak to knuckle under. It's all Frank's fault for<br> not beating you with a buggy whip. . . . I'm surprised at you,<br> Scarlett, for sprouting a conscience this late in life. Opportunists<br> like you shouldn't have them.’<br><br> ‘What is an oppor--what did you call it?’<br><br> ‘A person who takes advantage of opportunities.’<br><br> ‘Is that wrong?’<br><br> ‘It has always been held in disrepute--especially by those who had<br> the same opportunities and didn't take them.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, you are joking and I thought you were going to be<br> nice!’<br><br> ‘I am being nice--for me. Scarlett, darling, you are tipsy.<br> That's what's the matter with you.’<br><br> ‘You dare--’<br><br> ‘Yes, I dare. You are on the verge of what is vulgarly called a<br> 'crying jag' and so I shall change the subject and cheer you up by<br> telling you some news that will amuse you. In fact, that's why I<br> came here this evening, to tell you my news before I went away.’<br><br> ‘Where are you going?’<br><br> ‘To England and I may be gone for months. Forget your conscience,<br> Scarlett. I have no intention of discussing your soul's welfare<br> any further. Don't you want to hear my news?’<br><br> ‘But--’ she began feebly and paused. Between the brandy which was<br> smoothing out the harsh contours of remorse and Rhett's mocking but<br> comforting words, the pale specter of Frank was receding into<br> shadows. Perhaps Rhett was right. Perhaps God did understand.<br> She recovered enough to push the idea from the top of her mind and<br> decide: ‘I'll think about it all tomorrow.’<br><br> ‘What's your news?’ she said with an effort, blowing her nose on<br> his handkerchief and pushing back the hair that had begun to<br> straggle.<br><br> ‘My news is this,’ he answered, grinning down at her. ‘I still<br> want you more than any woman I've ever seen and now that Frank's<br> gone, I thought you'd be interested to know it.’<br><br> Scarlett jerked her hands away from his grasp and sprang to her<br> feet.<br><br> ‘I--you are the most ill-bred man in the world, coming here at this<br> time of all times with your filthy--I should have known you'd never<br> change. And Frank hardly cold! If you had any decency-- Will you<br> leave this--’<br><br> ‘Do be quiet or you'll have Miss Pittypat down here in a minute,’<br> he said, not rising but reaching up and taking both her fists.<br> ‘I'm afraid you miss my point.’<br><br> ‘Miss your point? I don't miss anything.’ She pulled against his<br> grip. ‘Turn me loose and get out of here. I never heard of such<br> bad taste. I--’<br><br> ‘Hush,’ he said. ‘I am asking you to marry me. Would you be<br> convinced if I knelt down?’<br><br> She said ‘Oh’ breathlessly and sat down hard on the sofa.<br><br> She stared at him, her mouth open, wondering if the brandy were<br> playing tricks on her mind, remembering senselessly his jibing:<br> ‘My dear, I'm not a marrying man.’ She was drunk or he was crazy.<br> But he did not look crazy. He looked as calm as though he were<br> discussing the weather, and his smooth drawl fell on her ears with<br> no particular emphasis.<br><br> ‘I always intended having you, Scarlett, since that first day I saw<br> you at Twelve Oaks when you threw that vase and swore and proved<br> that you weren't a lady. I always intended having you, one way or<br> another. But as you and Frank have made a little money, I know<br> you'll never be driven to me again with any interesting propositions<br> of loans and collaterals. So I see I'll have to marry you.’<br><br> ‘Rhett Butler, is this one of your vile jokes?’<br><br> ‘I bare my soul and you are suspicious! No, Scarlett, this is a<br> bona fide honorable declaration. I admit that it's not in the best<br> of taste, coming at this time, but I have a very good excuse for my<br> lack of breeding. I'm going away tomorrow for a long time and I<br> fear that if I wait till I return you'll have married some one else<br> with a little money. So I thought, why not me and my money?<br> Really, Scarlett, I can't go all my life, waiting to catch you<br> between husbands.’<br><br> He meant it. There was no doubt about it. Her mouth was dry as<br> she assimilated this knowledge and she swallowed and looked into<br> his eyes, trying to find some clue. They were full of laughter but<br> there was something else, deep in them, which she had never seen<br> before, a gleam that defied analysis. He sat easily, carelessly<br> but she felt that he was watching her as alertly as a cat watches a<br> mouse hole. There was a sense of leashed power straining beneath<br> his calm that made her draw back, a little frightened.<br><br> He was actually asking her to marry him; he was committing the<br> incredible. Once she had planned how she would torment him should<br> he ever propose. Once she had thought that if he ever spoke those<br> words she would humble him and make him feel her power and take a<br> malicious pleasure in doing it. Now, he had spoken and the plans<br> did not even occur to her, for he was no more in her power than he<br> had ever been. In fact, he held the whip hand of the situation so<br> completely that she was as flustered as a girl at her first<br> proposal and she could only blush and stammer.<br><br> ‘I--I shall never marry again.’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, you will. You were born to be married. Why not me?’<br><br> ‘But Rhett, I--I don't love you.’<br><br> ‘That should be no drawback. I don't recall that love was<br> prominent in your other two ventures.’<br><br> ‘Oh, how can you? You know I was fond of Frank!’<br><br> He said nothing.<br><br> ‘I was! I was!’<br><br> ‘Well, we won't argue that. Will you think over my proposition<br> while I'm gone?’<br><br> ‘Rhett, I don't like for things to drag on. I'd rather tell you<br> now. I'm going home to Tara soon and India Wilkes will stay with<br> Aunt Pittypat. I want to go home for a long spell and--I--I don't<br> ever want to get married again.’<br><br> ‘Nonsense. Why?’<br><br> ‘Oh, well--never mind why. I just don't like being married.’<br><br> ‘But, my poor child, you've never really been married. How can you<br> know? I'll admit you've had bad luck--once for spite and once for<br> money. Did you ever think of marrying--just for the fun of it?’<br><br> ‘Fun! Don't talk like a fool. There's no fun being married.’<br><br> ‘No? Why not?’<br><br> A measure of calm had returned and with it all the natural<br> bluntness which brandy brought to the surface.<br><br> ‘It's fun for men--though God knows why. I never could understand<br> it. But all a woman gets out of it is something to eat and a lot<br> of work and having to put up with a man's foolishness--and a baby<br> every year.’<br><br> He laughed so loudly that the sound echoed in the stillness and<br> Scarlett heard the kitchen door open.<br><br> ‘Hush! Mammy has ears like a lynx and it isn't decent to laugh so<br> soon after--hush laughing. You know it's true. Fun! Fiddle-dee-<br> dee!’<br><br> ‘I said you'd had bad luck and what you've just said proves it.<br> You've been married to a boy and to an old man. And into the<br> bargain I'll bet your mother told you that women must bear 'these<br> things' because of the compensating joys of motherhood. Well,<br> that's all wrong. Why not try marrying a fine young man who has a<br> bad reputation and a way with women? It'll be fun.’<br><br> ‘You are coarse and conceited and I think this conversation has<br> gone far enough. It's--it's quite vulgar.’<br><br> ‘And quite enjoyable, too, isn't it? I'll wager you never<br> discussed the marital relation with a man before, even Charles or<br> Frank.’<br><br> She scowled at him. Rhett knew too much. She wondered where he<br> had learned all he knew about women. It wasn't decent.<br><br> ‘Don't frown. Name the day, Scarlett. I'm not urging instant<br> matrimony because of your reputation. We'll wait the decent<br> interval. By the way, just how long is a 'decent interval'?’<br><br> ‘I haven't said I'd marry you. It isn't decent to even talk of<br> such things at such a time.’<br><br> ‘I've told you why I'm talking of them. I'm going away tomorrow<br> and I'm too ardent a lover to restrain my passion any longer. But<br> perhaps I've been too precipitate in my wooing.’<br><br> With a suddenness that startled her, he slid off the sofa onto his<br> knees and with one hand placed delicately over his heart, he<br> recited rapidly:<br><br> ‘Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments,<br> my dear Scarlett--I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy. It cannot have<br> escaped your notice that for some time past the friendship I have<br> had in my heart for you has ripened into a deeper feeling, a feeling<br> more beautiful, more pure, more sacred. Dare I name it you? Ah!<br> It is love which makes me so bold!’<br><br> ‘Do get up,’ she entreated. ‘You look such a fool and suppose<br> Mammy should come in and see you?’<br><br> ‘She would be stunned and incredulous at the first signs of my<br> gentility,’ said Rhett, arising lightly. ‘Come, Scarlett, you are<br> no child, no schoolgirl to put me off with foolish excuses about<br> decency and so forth. Say you'll marry me when I come back or,<br> before God, I won't go. I'll stay around here and play a guitar<br> under your window every night and sing at the top of my voice and<br> compromise you, so you'll have to marry me to save your reputation.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, do be sensible. I don't want to marry anybody.’<br><br> ‘No? You aren't telling me the real reason. It can't be girlish<br> timidity. What is it?’<br><br> Suddenly she thought of Ashley, saw him as vividly as though he<br> stood beside her, sunny haired, drowsy eyed, full of dignity, so<br> utterly different from Rhett. He was the real reason she did not<br> want to marry again, although she had no objections to Rhett and at<br> times was genuinely fond of him. She belonged to Ashley, forever<br> and ever. She had never belonged to Charles or Frank, could never<br> really belong to Rhett. Every part of her, almost everything she<br> had ever done, striven after, attained, belonged to Ashley, were<br> done because she loved him. Ashley and Tara, she belonged to them.<br> The smiles, the laughter, the kisses she had given Charles and<br> Frank were Ashley's, even though he had never claimed them, would<br> never claim them. Somewhere deep in her was the desire to keep<br> herself for him, although she knew he would never take her.<br><br> She did not know that her face had changed, that reverie had<br> brought a softness to her face which Rhett had never seen before.<br> He looked at the slanting green eyes, wide and misty, and the<br> tender curve of her lips and for a moment his breath stopped. Then<br> his mouth went down violently at one corner and he swore with<br> passionate impatience.<br><br> ‘Scarlett O'Hara, you're a fool!’<br><br> Before she could withdraw her mind from its far places, his arms<br> were around her, as sure and hard as on the dark road to Tara, so<br> long ago. She felt again the rush of helplessness, the sinking<br> yielding, the surging tide of warmth that left her limp. And the<br> quiet face of Ashley Wilkes was blurred and drowned to nothingness.<br> He bent back her head across his arm and kissed her, softly at<br> first, and then with a swift gradation of intensity that made her<br> cling to him as the only solid thing in a dizzy swaying world. His<br> insistent mouth was parting her shaking lips, sending wild tremors<br> along her nerves, evoking from her sensations she had never known<br> she was capable of feeling. And before a swimming giddiness spun<br> her round and round, she knew that she was kissing him back.<br><br> ‘Stop--please, I'm faint!’ she whispered, trying to turn her head<br> weakly from him. He pressed her head back hard against his<br> shoulder and she had a dizzy glimpse of his face. His eyes were<br> wide and blazing queerly and the tremor in his arms frightened her.<br><br> ‘I want to make you faint. I will make you faint. You've had this<br> coming to you for years. None of the fools you've known have<br> kissed you like this--have they? Your precious Charles or Frank or<br> your stupid Ashley--’<br><br> ‘Please--’<br><br> ‘I said your stupid Ashley. Gentlemen all--what do they know about<br> women? What did they know about you? I know you.’<br><br> His mouth was on hers again and she surrendered without a struggle,<br> too weak even to turn her head, without even the desire to turn it,<br> her heart shaking her with its poundings, fear of his strength and<br> her nerveless weakness sweeping her. What was he going to do? She<br> would faint if he did not stop. If he would only stop--if he would<br> never stop.<br><br> ‘Say Yes!’ His mouth was poised above hers and his eyes were so<br> close that they seemed enormous, filling the world. ‘Say Yes, damn<br> you, or--’<br><br> She whispered ‘Yes’ before she even thought. It was almost as if<br> he had willed the word and she had spoken it without her own<br> volition. But even as she spoke it, a sudden calm fell on her<br> spirit, her head began to stop spinning and even the giddiness of<br> the brandy was lessened. She had promised to marry him when she<br> had had no intention of promising. She hardly knew how it had all<br> come about but she was not sorry. It now seemed very natural that<br> she had said Yes--almost as if by divine intervention, a hand<br> stronger than hers was about her affairs, settling her problems for<br> her.<br><br> He drew a quick breath as she spoke and bent as if to kiss her<br> again and her eyes closed and her head fell back. But he drew back<br> and she was faintly disappointed. It made her feel so strange to<br> be kissed like this and yet there was something exciting about it.<br><br> He sat very still for a while holding her head against his shoulder<br> and, as if by effort, the trembling of his arms ceased. He moved<br> away from her a little and looked down at her. She opened her eyes<br> and saw that the frightening glow had gone from his face. But<br> somehow she could not meet his gaze and she dropped her eyes in a<br> rush of tingling confusion.<br><br> When he spoke his voice was very calm.<br><br> ‘You meant it? You don't want to take it back?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘It's not just because I've--what is the phrase?--'swept you off<br> your feet' by my--er--ardor?’<br><br> She could not answer for she did not know what to say, nor could<br> she meet his eyes. He put a hand under her chin and lifted her<br> face.<br><br> ‘I told you once that I could stand anything from you except a lie.<br> And now I want the truth. Just why did you say Yes?’<br><br> Still the words would not come, but, a measure of poise returning,<br> she kept her eyes demurely down and tucked the corners of her mouth<br> into a little smile.<br><br> ‘Look at me. Is it my money?’<br><br> ‘Why, Rhett! What a question!’<br><br> ‘Look up and don't try to sweet talk me. I'm not Charles or Frank<br> or any of the County boys to be taken in by your fluttering lids.<br> Is it my money?’<br><br> ‘Well--yes, a part.’<br><br> ‘A part?’<br><br> He did not seem annoyed. He drew a swift breath and with an effort<br> wiped from his eyes the eagerness her words had brought, an<br> eagerness which she was too confused to see.<br><br> ‘Well,’ she floundered helplessly, ‘money does help, you know,<br> Rhett, and God knows Frank didn't leave any too much. But then--<br> well, Rhett, we do get on, you know. And you are the only man I<br> ever saw who could stand the truth from a woman, and it would be<br> nice having a husband who didn't think me a silly fool and expect<br> me to tell lies--and--well, I am fond of you.’<br><br> ‘Fond of me?’<br><br> ‘Well,’ she said fretfully, ‘if I said I was madly in love with<br> you, I'd be lying and what's more, you'd know it.’<br><br> ‘Sometimes I think you carry your truth telling too far, my pet.<br> Don't you think, even if it was a lie, that it would be appropriate<br> for you to say 'I love you, Rhett,' even if you didn't mean it?’<br><br> What was he driving at, she wondered, becoming more confused. He<br> looked so queer, eager, hurt, mocking. He took his hands from her<br> and shoved them deep in his trousers pockets and she saw him ball<br> his fists.<br><br> ‘If it costs me a husband, I'll tell the truth,’ she thought<br> grimly, her blood up as always when he baited her.<br><br> ‘Rhett, it would be a lie, and why should we go through all that<br> foolishness? I'm fond of you, like I said. You know how it is.<br> You told me once that you didn't love me but that we had a lot in<br> common. Both rascals, was the way you--’<br><br> ‘Oh, God!’ he whispered rapidly, turning his head away. ‘To be<br> taken in my own trap!’<br><br> ‘What did you say?’<br><br> ‘Nothing,’ and he looked at her and laughed, but it was not a<br> pleasant laugh. ‘Name the day, my dear,’ and he laughed again and<br> bent and kissed her hands. She was relieved to see his mood pass<br> and good humor apparently return, so she smiled too.<br><br> He played with her hand for a moment and grinned up at her.<br><br> ‘Did you ever in your novel reading come across the old situation<br> of the disinterested wife falling in love with her own husband?’<br><br> ‘You know I don't read novels,’ she said and, trying to equal his<br> jesting mood, went on: ‘Besides, you once said it was the height<br> of bad form for husbands and wives to love each other.’<br><br> ‘I once said too God damn many things,’ he retorted abruptly and<br> rose to his feet.<br><br> ‘Don't swear.’<br><br> ‘You'll have to get used to it and learn to swear too. You'll have<br> to get used to all my bad habits. That'll be part of the price of<br> being--fond of me and getting your pretty paws on my money.’<br><br> ‘Well, don't fly off the handle so, because I didn't lie and make<br> you feel conceited. You aren't in love with me, are you? Why<br> should I be in love with you?’<br><br> ‘No, my dear, I'm not in love with you, no more than you are with<br> me, and if I were, you would be the last person I'd ever tell. God<br> help the man who ever really loves you. You'd break his heart, my<br> darling, cruel, destructive little cat who is so careless and<br> confident she doesn't even trouble to sheathe her claws.’<br><br> He jerked her to her feet and kissed her again, but this time his<br> lips were different for he seemed not to care if he hurt her--<br> seemed to want to hurt her, to insult her. His lips slid down to<br> her throat and finally he pressed them against the taffeta over her<br> breast, so hard and so long that his breath burnt to her skin. Her<br> hands struggled up, pushing him away in outraged modesty.<br><br> ‘You mustn't! How dare you!’<br><br> ‘Your heart's going like a rabbit's,’ he said mockingly. ‘All too<br> fast for mere fondness I would think, if I were conceited. Smooth<br> your ruffled feathers. You are just putting on these virginal<br> airs. Tell me what I shall bring you from England. A ring? What<br> kind would you like?’<br><br> She wavered momentarily between interest in his last words and a<br> feminine desire to prolong the scene with anger and indignation.<br><br> ‘Oh--a diamond ring--and Rhett, do buy a great big one.’<br><br> ‘So you can flaunt it before your poverty-stricken friends and say<br> 'See what I caught!' Very well, you shall have a big one, one so<br> big that your less-fortunate friends can comfort themselves by<br> whispering that it's really vulgar to wear such large stones.’<br><br> He abruptly started off across the room and she followed him,<br> bewildered, to the closed doors.<br><br> ‘What is the matter? Where are you going?’<br><br> ‘To my rooms to finish packing.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but--’<br><br> ‘But, what?’<br><br> ‘Nothing. I hope you have a nice trip.’<br><br> ‘Thank you.’<br><br> He opened the door and walked into the hall. Scarlett trailed<br> after him, somewhat at a loss, a trifle disappointed as at an<br> unexpected anticlimax. He slipped on his coat and picked up his<br> gloves and hat.<br><br> ‘I'll write you. Let me know if you change your mind.’<br><br> ‘Aren't you--’<br><br> ‘Well?’ He seemed impatient to be off.<br><br> ‘Aren't you going to kiss me good-by?’ she whispered, mindful of<br> the ears of the house.<br><br> ‘Don't you think you've had enough kissing for one evening?’ he<br> retorted and grinned down at her. ‘To think of a modest, well-<br> brought-up young woman-- Well, I told you it would be fun, didn't<br> I?’<br><br> ‘Oh, you are impossible!’ she cried in wrath, not caring if Mammy<br> did hear. ‘And I don't care if you never come back.’<br><br> She turned and flounced toward the stairs, expecting to feel his<br> warm hand on her arm, stopping her. But he only pulled open the<br> front door and a cold draft swept in.<br><br> ‘But I will come back,’ he said and went out, leaving her on the<br> bottom step looking at the closed door.<br><br> The ring Rhett brought back from England was large indeed, so large<br> it embarrassed Scarlett to wear it. She loved gaudy and expensive<br> jewelry but she had an uneasy feeling that everyone was saying,<br> with perfect truth, that this ring was vulgar. The central stone<br> was a four-carat diamond and, surrounding it, were a number of<br> emeralds. It reached to the knuckle of her finger and gave her<br> hand the appearance of being weighted down. Scarlett had a<br> suspicion that Rhett had gone to great pains to have the ring made<br> up and, for pure meanness, had ordered it made as ostentatious as<br> possible.<br><br> Until Rhett was back in Atlanta and the ring on her finger she told<br> no one, not even her family, of her intentions, and when she did<br> announce her engagement a storm of bitter gossip broke out. Since<br> the Klan affair Rhett and Scarlett had been, with the exception of<br> the Yankees and Carpetbaggers, the town's most unpopular citizens.<br> Everyone had disapproved of Scarlett since the far-away day when<br> she abandoned the weeds worn for Charlie Hamilton. Their<br> disapproval had grown stronger because of her unwomanly conduct in<br> the matter of the mills, her immodesty in showing herself when she<br> was pregnant and so many other things. But when she brought about<br> the death of Frank and Tommy and jeopardized the lives of a dozen<br> other men, their dislike flamed into public condemnation.<br><br> As for Rhett, he had enjoyed the town's hatred since his<br> speculations during the war and he had not further endeared himself<br> to his fellow citizens by his alliances with the Republicans since<br> then. But, oddly enough, the fact that he had saved the lives of<br> some of Atlanta's most prominent men was what aroused the hottest<br> hate of Atlanta's ladies.<br><br> It was not that they regretted their men were still alive. It was<br> that they bitterly resented owing the men's lives to such a man as<br> Rhett and to such an embarrassing trick. For months they had<br> writhed under Yankee laughter and scorn, and the ladies felt and<br> said that if Rhett really had the good of the Klan at heart he<br> would have managed the affair in a more seemly fashion. They said<br> he had deliberately dragged in Belle Watling to put the nice people<br> of the town in a disgraceful position. And so he deserved neither<br> thanks for rescuing the men nor forgiveness for his past sins.<br><br> These women, so swift to kindness, so tender to the sorrowing, so<br> untiring in times of stress, could be as implacable as furies to<br> any renegade who broke one small law of their unwritten code. This<br> code was simple. Reverence for the Confederacy, honor to the<br> veterans, loyalty to old forms, pride in poverty, open hands to<br> friends and undying hatred to Yankees. Between them, Scarlett and<br> Rhett had outraged every tenet of this code.<br><br> The men whose lives Rhett had saved attempted, out of decency and a<br> sense of gratitude, to keep their women silent but they had little<br> success. Before the announcement of their coming marriage, the two<br> had been unpopular enough but people could still be polite to them<br> in a formal way. Now even that cold courtesy was no longer<br> possible. The news of their engagement came like an explosion,<br> unexpected and shattering, rocking the town, and even the mildest-<br> mannered women spoke their minds heatedly. Marrying barely a year<br> after Frank's death and she had killed him! And marrying that<br> Butler man who owned a brothel and who was in with the Yankees and<br> Carpetbaggers in all kinds of thieving schemes! Separately the two<br> of them could be endured, but the brazen combination of Scarlett<br> and Rhett was too much to be borne. Common and vile, both of them!<br> They ought to be run out of town!<br><br> Atlanta might perhaps have been more tolerant toward the two if the<br> news of their engagement had not come at a time when Rhett's<br> Carpetbagger and Scallawag cronies were more odious in the sight of<br> respectable citizens than they had ever been before. Public<br> feeling against the Yankees and all their allies was at fever heat<br> at the very time when the town learned of the engagement, for the<br> last citadel of Georgia's resistance to Yankee rule had just<br> fallen. The long campaign which had begun when Sherman moved<br> southward from above Dalton, four years before, had finally reached<br> its climax, and the state's humiliation was complete.<br><br> Three years of Reconstruction had passed and they had been three<br> years of terrorism. Everyone had thought that conditions were<br> already as bad as they could ever be. But now Georgia was<br> discovering that Reconstruction at its worst had just begun.<br><br> For three years the Federal government had been trying to impose<br> alien ideas and an alien rule upon Georgia and, with an army to<br> enforce its commands, it had largely succeeded. But only the power<br> of the military upheld the new regime. The state was under the<br> Yankee rule but not by the state's consent. Georgia's leaders had<br> kept on battling for the state's right to govern itself according<br> to its own ideas. They had continued resisting all efforts to<br> force them to bow down and accept the dictates of Washington as<br> their own state law.<br><br> Officially, Georgia's government had never capitulated but it had<br> been a futile fight, an ever-losing fight. It was a fight that<br> could not win but it had, at least, postponed the inevitable.<br> Already many other Southern states had illiterate negroes in high<br> public office and legislatures dominated by negroes and<br> Carpetbaggers. But Georgia, by its stubborn resistance, had so far<br> escaped this final degradation. For the greater part of three<br> years, the state's capitol had remained in the control of white men<br> and Democrats. With Yankee soldiers everywhere, the state<br> officials could do little but protest and resist. Their power was<br> nominal but they had at least been able to keep the state<br> government in the hands of native Georgians. Now even that last<br> stronghold had fallen.<br><br> Just as Johnston and his men had been driven back step by step from<br> Dalton to Atlanta, four years before, so had the Georgia Democrats<br> been driven back little by little, from 1865 on. The power of the<br> Federal government over the state's affairs and the lives of its<br> citizens had been steadily made greater and greater. Force had<br> been piled on top of force and military edicts in increasing<br> numbers had rendered the civil authority more and more impotent.<br> Finally, with Georgia in the status of a military province, the<br> polls had been ordered thrown open to the negroes, whether the<br> state's laws permitted it or not.<br><br> A week before Scarlett and Rhett announced their engagement, an<br> election for governor had been held. The Southern Democrats had<br> General John B. Gordon, one of Georgia's best loved and most<br> honored citizens, as their candidate. Opposing him was a<br> Republican named Bullock. The election had lasted three days<br> instead of one. Trainloads of negroes had been rushed from town to<br> town, voting at every precinct along the way. Of course, Bullock<br> had won.<br><br> If the capture of Georgia by Sherman had caused bitterness, the<br> final capture of the state's capitol by the Carpetbaggers, Yankees<br> and negroes caused an intensity of bitterness such as the state had<br> never known before. Atlanta and Georgia seethed and raged.<br><br> And Rhett Butler was a friend of the hated Bullock!<br><br> Scarlett, with her usual disregard of all matters not directly<br> under her nose, had scarcely known an election was being held.<br> Rhett had taken no part in the election and his relations with the<br> Yankees were no different from what they had always been. But the<br> fact remained that Rhett was a Scallawag and a friend of Bullock.<br> And, if the marriage went through, Scarlett also would be turning<br> Scallawag. Atlanta was in no mood to be tolerant or charitable<br> toward anyone in the enemy camp and, the news of the engagement<br> coming when it did, the town remembered all of the evil things<br> about the pair and none of the good.<br><br> Scarlett knew the town was rocking but she did not realize the<br> extent of public feeling until Mrs. Merriwether, urged on by her<br> church circle, took it upon herself to speak to her for her own<br> good.<br><br> ‘Because your own dear mother is dead and Miss Pitty, not being a<br> matron, is not qualified to--er, well, to talk to you upon such a<br> subject, I feel that I must warn you, Scarlett, Captain Butler is<br> not the kind of a man for any woman of good family to marry. He is<br> a--’<br><br> ‘He managed to save Grandpa Merriwether's neck and your nephew's,<br> too.’<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether swelled. Hardly an hour before she had had an<br> irritating talk with Grandpa. The old man had remarked that she<br> must not value his hide very much if she did not feel some<br> gratitude to Rhett Butler, even if the man was a Scallawag and a<br> scoundrel.<br><br> ‘He only did that as a dirty trick on us all, Scarlett, to<br> embarrass us in front of the Yankees,’ Mrs. Merriwether continued.<br> ‘You know as well as I do that the man is a rogue. He always has<br> been and now he's unspeakable. He is simply not the kind of man<br> decent people receive.’<br><br> ‘No? That's strange, Mrs. Merriwether. He was in your parlor<br> often enough during the war. And he gave Maybelle her white satin<br> wedding dress, didn't he? Or is my memory wrong?’<br><br> ‘Things are so different during the war and nice people associated<br> with many men who were not quite-- It was all for the Cause and<br> very proper, too. Surely you can't be thinking of marrying a man<br> who wasn't in the army, who jeered at men who did enlist?’<br><br> ‘He was, too, in the army. He was in the army eight months. He<br> was in the last campaign and fought at Franklin and was with<br> General Johnston when he surrendered.’<br><br> ‘I had not heard that,’ said Mrs. Merriwether and she looked as if<br> she did not believe it either. ‘But he wasn't wounded,’ she added,<br> triumphantly.<br><br> ‘Lots of men weren't.’<br><br> ‘Everybody who was anybody got wounded. _I_ know no one who wasn't<br> wounded.’<br><br> Scarlett was goaded.<br><br> ‘Then I guess all the men you knew were such fools they didn't know<br> when to come in out of a shower of rain--or of minie balls. Now,<br> let me tell you this, Mrs. Merriwether, and you can take it back to<br> your busybody friends. I'm going to marry Captain Butler and I<br> wouldn't care if he'd fought on the Yankee side.’<br><br> When that worthy matron went out of the house with her bonnet<br> jerking with rage, Scarlett knew she had an open enemy now instead<br> of a disapproving friend. But she did not care. Nothing Mrs.<br> Merriwether could say or do could hurt her. She did not care what<br> anyone said--anyone except Mammy.<br><br> Scarlett had borne with Pitty's swooning at the news and had<br> steeled herself to see Ashley look suddenly old and avoid her eyes<br> as he wished her happiness. She had been amused and irritated at<br> the letters from Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie in Charleston,<br> horror struck at the news, forbidding the marriage, telling her it<br> would not only ruin her social position but endanger theirs. She<br> had even laughed when Melanie with a worried pucker in her brows<br> said loyally: ‘Of course, Captain Butler is much nicer than most<br> people realize and he was so kind and clever, the way he saved<br> Ashley. And after all, he did fight for the Confederacy. But,<br> Scarlett, don't you think you'd better not decide so hastily?’<br><br> No, she didn't mind what anybody said, except Mammy. Mammy's words<br> were the ones that made her most angry and brought the greatest<br> hurt.<br><br> ‘Ah has seed you do a heap of things dat would hu't Miss Ellen, did<br> she know. An' it has done sorrered me a plen'y. But disyere is de<br> wust yit. Mahyin' trash! Yas'm, Ah said trash! Doan go tellin'<br> me he come frum fine folkses. Dat doan mek no diffunce. Trash<br> come outer de high places, same as de low, and he trash! Yas'm,<br> Miss Scarlett, Ah's seed you tek Mist' Charles 'way frum Miss Honey<br> w'en you din' keer nuthin' 'bout him. An' Ah's seed you rob yo own<br> sister of Mist' Frank. An' Ah's heshed mah mouf 'bout a heap of<br> things you is done, lak sellin' po' lumber fer good, an' lyin'<br> 'bout de other lumber gempmums, an' ridin' roun' by yo'seff,<br> exposin' yo'seff ter free issue niggers an' gettin' Mist' Frank<br> shot, an' not feedin' dem po' convicts nuff ter keep dey souls in<br> dey bodies. Ah's done heshed mah mouf, even ef Miss Ellen in de<br> Promise Lan' wuz sayin' 'Mammy, Mammy! You ain' look affer mah<br> chile right!' Yas'm. Ah's stood fer all dat but Ah ain' gwine<br> stand fer dis, Miss Scarlett. You kain mahy wid trash. Not w'ile<br> Ah got breaf in mah body.’<br><br> ‘I shall marry whom I please,’ said Scarlett coldly. ‘I think you<br> are forgetting your place, Mammy.’<br><br> ‘An' high time, too! Ef Ah doan say dese wuds ter you, who gwine<br> ter do it?’<br><br> ‘I've been thinking the matter over, Mammy, and I've decided that<br> the best thing for you to do is to go back to Tara. I'll give you<br> some money and--’<br><br> Mammy drew herself up with all her dignity.<br><br> ‘Ah is free, Miss Scarlett. You kain sen' me nowhar Ah doan wanter<br> go. An' w'en Ah goes back ter Tara, it's gwine be w'en you goes<br> wid me. Ah ain' gwine leave Miss Ellen's chile, an' dar ain' no<br> way in de worl' ter mek me go. An' Ah ain' gwine leave Miss<br> Ellen's gran'chillun fer no trashy step-pa ter bring up, needer.<br> Hyah Ah is and hyah Ah stays!’<br><br> ‘I will not have you staying in my house and being rude to Captain<br> Butler. I am going to marry him and there's no more to be said.’<br><br> ‘Dar is plen'y mo' ter be said,’ retorted Mammy slowly and into her<br> blurred old eyes there came the light of battle.<br><br> ‘But Ah ain' never thought ter say it ter none of Miss Ellen's<br> blood. But, Miss Scarlett, lissen ter me. You ain' nuthin' but a<br> mule in hawse harness. You kin polish a mule's feet an' shine his<br> hide an' put brass all over his harness an' hitch him ter a fine<br> cah'ige. But he a mule jes' de same. He doan fool nobody. An'<br> you is jes' de same. You got silk dresses an' de mills an' de sto'<br> an' de money, an' you give yo'seff airs lak a fine hawse, but you a<br> mule jes' de same. An' you ain' foolin' nobody, needer. An' dat<br> Butler man, he come of good stock and he all slicked up lak a race<br> hawse, but he a mule in hawse harness, jes' lak you.’<br><br> Mammy bent a piercing look on her mistress. Scarlett was<br> speechless and quivering with insult.<br><br> ‘Ef you say you gwine mahy him, you gwine do it, 'cause you is<br> bullhaided lak yo' pa. But 'member dis, Miss Scarlett, Ah ain'<br> leavin' you. Ah gwine stay right hyah an' see dis ting thoo.’<br><br> Without waiting for a reply, Mammy turned and left Scarlett and if<br> she had said: ‘Thou shalt see me at Philippi!’ her tones would not<br> have been more ominous.<br><br> While they were honeymooning in New Orleans Scarlett told Rhett of<br> Mammy's words. To her surprise and indignation he laughed at<br> Mammy's statement about mules in horse harness.<br><br> ‘I have never heard a profound truth expressed so succinctly,’ he<br> said. ‘Mammy's a smart old soul and one of the few people I know<br> whose respect and good will I'd like to have. But, being a mule, I<br> suppose I'll never get either from her. She even refused the ten-<br> dollar gold piece which I, in my groomlike fervor, wished to<br> present her after the wedding. I've seen so few people who did not<br> melt at the sight of cash. But she looked me in the eye and<br> thanked me and said she wasn't a free issue nigger and didn't need<br> my money.’<br><br> ‘Why should she take on so? Why should everybody gabble about me<br> like a bunch of guinea hens? It's my own affair whom I marry and<br> how often I marry. I've always minded my own business. Why don't<br> other people mind theirs?’<br><br> ‘My pet, the world can forgive practically anything except people<br> who mind their own business. But why should you squall like a<br> scalded cat? You've said often enough that you didn't mind what<br> people said about you. Why not prove it? You know you've laid<br> yourself open to criticism so often in small matters, you can't<br> expect to escape gossip in this large matter. You knew there'd be<br> talk if you married a villain like me. If I were a low-bred<br> poverty-stricken villain, people wouldn't be so mad. But a rich,<br> flourishing villain--of course, that's unforgivable.’<br><br> ‘I wish you'd be serious sometimes!’<br><br> ‘I am serious. It's always annoying to the godly when the ungodly<br> flourish like the green bay tree. Cheer up, Scarlett, didn't you<br> tell me once that the main reason you wanted a lot of money was so<br> you could tell everybody to go to hell? Now's your chance.’<br><br> ‘But you were the main one I wanted to tell to go to hell,’ said<br> Scarlett, and laughed.<br><br> ‘Do you still want to tell me to go to hell?’<br><br> ‘Well, not as often as I used to.’<br><br> ‘Do it whenever you like, if it makes you happy.’<br><br> ‘It doesn't make me especially happy,’ said Scarlett and, bending,<br> she kissed him carelessly. His dark eyes flickered quickly over<br> her face, hunting for something in her eyes which he did not find,<br> and he laughed shortly.<br><br> ‘Forget about Atlanta. Forget about the old cats. I brought you<br> to New Orleans to have fun and I intend that you shall have it.’</p><br>PART FIVE<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER XLVIII<br><br> <br> She did have fun, more fun than she had had since the spring before<br> the war. New Orleans was such a strange, glamorous place and<br> Scarlett enjoyed it with the headlong pleasure of a pardoned life<br> prisoner. The Carpetbaggers were looting the town, many honest<br> folk were driven from their homes and did not know where to look<br> for their next meal, and a negro sat in the lieutenant governor's<br> chair. But the New Orleans Rhett showed her was the gayest place<br> she had ever seen. The people she met seemed to have all the money<br> they wanted and no cares at all. Rhett introduced her to dozens of<br> women, pretty women in bright gowns, women who had soft hands that<br> showed no signs of hard work, women who laughed at everything and<br> never talked of stupid serious things or hard times. And the men<br> she met--how thrilling they were! And how different from Atlanta<br> men--and how they fought to dance with her, and paid her the most<br> extravagant compliments as though she were a young belle.<br><br> These men had the same hard reckless look Rhett wore. Their eyes<br> were always alert, like men who have lived too long with danger to<br> be ever quite careless. They seemed to have no pasts or futures,<br> and they politely discouraged Scarlett when, to make conversation,<br> she asked what or where they were before they came to New Orleans.<br> That, in itself, was strange, for in Atlanta every respectable<br> newcomer hastened to present his credentials, to tell proudly of<br> his home and family, to trace the tortuous mazes of relationship<br> that stretched over the entire South.<br><br> But these men were a taciturn lot, picking their words carefully.<br> Sometimes when Rhett was alone with them and Scarlett in the next<br> room, she heard laughter and caught fragments of conversation that<br> meant nothing to her, scraps of words, puzzling names--Cuba and<br> Nassau in the blockade days, the gold rush and claim jumping, gun<br> running and filibustering, Nicaragua and William Walker and how he<br> died against a wall at Truxillo. Once her sudden entrance abruptly<br> terminated a conversation about what had happened to the members of<br> Quantrill's band of guerillas, and she caught the names of Frank<br> and Jesse James.<br><br> But they were all well mannered, beautifully tailored, and they<br> evidently admired her, so it mattered little to Scarlett that they<br> chose to live utterly in the present. What really mattered was<br> that they were Rhett's friends and had large houses and fine<br> carriages, and they took her and Rhett driving, invited them to<br> suppers, gave parties in their honor. And Scarlett like them very<br> well. Rhett was amused when she told him so.<br><br> ‘I thought you would,’ he said and laughed.<br><br> ‘Why not?’ her suspicions aroused as always by his laughter.<br><br> ‘They're all second-raters, black sheep, rascals. They're all<br> adventurers or Carpetbag aristocrats. They all made their money<br> speculating in food like your loving husband or out of dubious<br> government contracts or in shady ways that won't bear<br> investigation.’<br><br> ‘I don't believe it. You're teasing. They're the nicest<br> people . . .’<br><br> ‘The nicest people in town are starving,’ said Rhett. ‘And living<br> politely in hovels, and I doubt if I'd be received in those hovels.<br> You see, my dear, I was engaged in some of my nefarious schemes<br> here during the war and these people have devilish long memories!<br> Scarlett, you are a constant joy to me. You unerringly manage to<br> pick the wrong people and the wrong things.’<br><br> ‘But they are your friends!’<br><br> ‘Oh, but I like rascals. My early youth was spent as a gambler on<br> a river boat and I can understand people like that. But I'm not<br> blind to what they are. Whereas you’--he laughed again--’you have<br> no instinct about people, no discrimination between the cheap and<br> the great. Sometimes, I think that the only great ladies you've<br> ever associated with were your mother and Miss Melly and neither<br> seems to have made any impression on you.’<br><br> ‘Melly! Why she's as plain as an old shoe and her clothes always<br> look tacky and she never has two words to say for herself!’<br><br> ‘Spare me your jealousy, Madam. Beauty doesn't make a lady, nor<br> clothes a great lady!’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't they! Just you wait, Rhett Butler, and I'll show you.<br> Now that I've--we've got money, I'm going to be the greatest lady<br> you ever saw!’<br><br> ‘I shall wait with interest,’ he said.<br><br> More exciting than the people she met were the frocks Rhett bought<br> her, superintending the choice of colors, materials and designs<br> himself. Hoops were out now, and the new styles were charming with<br> the skirts pulled back from the front and draped over bustles, and<br> on the bustles were wreaths of flowers and bows and cascades of<br> lace. She thought of the modest hoops of the war years and she<br> felt a little embarrassed at these new skirts which undeniably<br> outlined her abdomen. And the darling little bonnets that were not<br> really bonnets at all, but flat little affairs worn over one eye<br> and laden with fruits and flowers, dancing plumes and fluttering<br> ribbons! (If only Rhett had not been so silly and burned the false<br> curls she bought to augment her knot of Indian-straight hair that<br> peeked from the rear of these little hats!) And the delicate<br> convent-made underwear! How lovely it was and how many sets she<br> had! Chemises and nightgowns and petticoats of the finest linen<br> trimmed with dainty embroidery and infinitesimal tucks. And the<br> satin slippers Rhett bought her! They had heels three inches high<br> and huge glittering paste buckles on them. And silk stockings, a<br> dozen pairs and not a one had cotton tops! What riches!<br><br> She recklessly bought gifts for the family. A furry St. Bernard<br> puppy for Wade, who had always longed for one, a Persian kitten for<br> Beau, a coral bracelet for little Ella, a heavy necklace with<br> moonstone pendants for Aunt Pitty, a complete set of Shakespeare<br> for Melanie and Ashley, an elaborate livery for Uncle Peter,<br> including a high silk coachman's hat with a brush upon it, dress<br> lengths for Dilcey and Cookie, expensive gifts for everyone at<br> Tara.<br><br> ‘But what have you bought for Mammy?’ questioned Rhett, looking<br> over the pile of gifts spread out on the bed in their hotel room,<br> and removing the puppy and kitten to the dressing room.<br><br> ‘Not a thing. She was hateful. Why should I bring her a present<br> when she called us mules?’<br><br> ‘Why should you so resent hearing the truth, my pet? You must<br> bring Mammy a present. It would break her heart if you didn't--and<br> hearts like hers are too valuable to be broken.’<br><br> ‘I won't take her a thing. She doesn't deserve it.’<br><br> ‘Then I'll buy her one. I remember my mammy always said that when<br> she went to Heaven she wanted a taffeta petticoat so stiff that it<br> would stand by itself and so rustly that the Lord God would think<br> it was made of angels' wings. I'll buy Mammy some red taffeta and<br> have an elegant petticoat made.’<br><br> ‘She won't take it from you. She'd die rather than wear it.’<br><br> ‘I don't doubt it. But I'll make the gesture just the same.’<br><br> The shops of New Orleans were so rich and exciting and shopping<br> with Rhett was an adventure. Dining with him was an adventure too,<br> and one more thrilling than shopping, for he knew what to order and<br> how it should be cooked. The wines and liqueurs and champagnes of<br> New Orleans were new and exhilarating to her, acquainted with only<br> homemade blackberry and scuppernong vintages and Aunt Pitty's<br> ‘swoon’ brandy; but oh, the food Rhett ordered! Best of all things<br> in New Orleans was the food. Remembering the bitter hungry days at<br> Tara and her more recent penury, Scarlett felt that she could never<br> eat enough of these rich dishes. Gumboes and shrimp Creole, doves<br> in wine and oysters in crumbly patties full of creamy sauce,<br> mushrooms and sweetbreads and turkey livers, fish baked cunningly<br> in oiled paper and limes. Her appetite never dulled, for whenever<br> she remembered the everlasting goobers and dried peas and sweet<br> potatoes at Tara, she felt an urge to gorge herself anew of Creole<br> dishes.<br><br> ‘You eat as though each meal were your last,’ said Rhett. ‘Don't<br> scrape the plate, Scarlett. I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.<br> You have only to ask the waiter. If you don't stop being such a<br> glutton, you'll be as fat as the Cuban ladies and then I shall<br> divorce you.’<br><br> But she only put out her tongue at him and ordered another pastry,<br> thick with chocolate and stuffed with meringue.<br><br> What fun it was to be able to spend as much money as you liked and<br> not count pennies and feel that you should save them to pay taxes<br> or buy mules. What fun to be with people who were gay and rich and<br> not genteelly poor like Atlanta people. What fun to wear rustling<br> brocade dresses that showed your waist and all your neck and arms<br> and more than a little of your breast and know that men were<br> admiring you. And what fun to eat all you wanted without having<br> censorious people say you weren't ladylike. And what fun to drink<br> all the champagne you pleased. The first time she drank too much,<br> she was embarrassed when she awoke the next morning with a<br> splitting headache and an awful memory of singing ‘Bonnie Blue<br> Flag’ all the way back to the hotel, through the streets of New<br> Orleans, in an open carriage. She had never seen a lady even<br> tipsy, and the only drunken woman she had ever seen had been that<br> Watling creature on the day when Atlanta fell. She hardly knew how<br> to face Rhett, so great was her humiliation, but the affair seemed<br> only to amuse him. Everything she did seemed to amuse him, as<br> though she were a gamboling kitten.<br><br> It was exciting to go out with him for he was so handsome. Somehow<br> she had never given his looks a thought before, and in Atlanta<br> everyone had been too preoccupied with his shortcomings ever to<br> talk about his appearance. But here in New Orleans she could see<br> how the eyes of other women followed him and how they fluttered<br> when he bent over their hands. The realization that other women<br> were attracted by her husband, and perhaps envied her, made her<br> suddenly proud to be seen by his side.<br><br> ‘Why, we're a handsome people,’ thought Scarlett with pleasure.<br><br> Yes, as Rhett had prophesied, marriage could be a lot of fun. Not<br> only was it fun but she was learning many things. That was odd in<br> itself, because Scarlett had thought life could teach her no more.<br> Now she felt like a child, every day on the brink of a new<br> discovery.<br><br> First, she learned that marriage with Rhett was a far different<br> matter from marriage with either Charles or Frank. They had<br> respected her and been afraid of her temper. They had begged for<br> favors and if it pleased her, she had bestowed them. Rhett did not<br> fear her and, she often thought, did not respect her very much<br> either. What he wanted to do, he did, and if she did not like it,<br> he laughed at her. She did not love him but he was undoubtedly an<br> exciting person to live with. The most exciting thing about him<br> was that even in his outbursts of passion which were flavored<br> sometimes with cruelty, sometimes with irritating amusement, he<br> seemed always to be holding himself under restraint, always riding<br> his emotions with a curb bit.<br><br> ‘I guess that's because he isn't really in love with me,’ she<br> thought and was content enough with the state of affairs. ‘I<br> should hate for him to ever turn completely loose in any way.’ But<br> still the thought of the possibility teased her curiosity in an<br> exciting way.<br><br> Living with Rhett, she learned many new things about him, and she<br> had thought she knew him so well. She learned that his voice could<br> be as silky as a cat's fur one moment and crisp and crackling with<br> oaths the next. He could tell, with apparent sincerity and<br> approval, stories of courage and honor and virtue and love in the<br> odd places he had been, and follow them with ribald stories of<br> coldest cynicism. She knew no man should tell such stories to his<br> wife but they were entertaining and they appealed to something<br> coarse and earthy in her. He could be an ardent, almost a tender,<br> lover for a brief while, and almost immediately a mocking devil who<br> ripped the lid from her gunpowder temper, fired it and enjoyed the<br> explosion. She learned that his compliments were always two edged<br> and his tenderest expressions open to suspicion. In fact, in those<br> two weeks in New Orleans, she learned everything about him except<br> what he really was.<br><br> Some mornings he dismissed the maid and brought her the breakfast<br> tray himself and fed her as though she were a child, took the<br> hairbrush from her hand and brushed her long dark hair until it<br> snapped and crackled. Yet other mornings she was torn rudely out<br> of deep slumber when he snatched all the bed covers from her and<br> tickled her bare feet. Sometimes he listened with dignified<br> interest to details of her businesses, nodding approval at her<br> sagacity, and at other times he called her somewhat dubious<br> tradings scavenging, highway robbery and extortion. He took her to<br> plays and annoyed her by whispering that God probably didn't<br> approve of such amusements, and to churches and, sotto voce,<br> retailed funny obscenities and then reproved her for laughing. He<br> encouraged her to speak her mind, to be flippant and daring. She<br> picked up from him the gift of stinging words and sardonic phrases<br> and learned to relish using them for the power they gave her over<br> other people. But she did not possess his sense of humor which<br> tempered his malice, nor his smile that jeered at himself even<br> while he was jeering others.<br><br> He made her play and she had almost forgotten how. Life had been<br> so serious and so bitter. He knew how to play and swept her along<br> with him. But he never played like a boy; he was a man and no<br> matter what he did, she could never forget it. She could not look<br> down on him from the heights of womanly superiority, smiling as<br> women have always smiled at the antics of men who are boys at<br> heart.<br><br> This annoyed her a little, whenever she thought of it. It would be<br> pleasant to feel superior to Rhett. All the other men she had<br> known she could dismiss with a half-contemptuous ‘What a child!’<br> Her father, the Tarleton twins with their love of teasing and their<br> elaborate practical jokes, the hairy little Fontaines with their<br> childish rages, Charles, Frank, all the men who had paid court to<br> her during the war--everyone, in fact, except Ashley. Only Ashley<br> and Rhett eluded her understanding and her control for they were<br> both adults, and the elements of boyishness were lacking in them.<br><br> She did not understand Rhett, nor did she trouble to understand<br> him, though there were things about him which occasionally puzzled<br> her. There was the way he looked at her sometimes, when he thought<br> she was unaware. Turning quickly she frequently caught him<br> watching her, an alert, eager, waiting look in his eyes.<br><br> ‘Why do you look at me like that?’ she once asked irritably. ‘Like<br> a cat at a mouse hole!’<br><br> But his face had changed swiftly and he only laughed. Soon she<br> forgot it and did not puzzle her head about it any more, or about<br> anything concerning Rhett. He was too unpredictable to bother<br> about and life was very pleasant--except when she thought of<br> Ashley.<br><br> Rhett kept her too busy to think of Ashley often. Ashley was<br> hardly ever in her thoughts during the day but at night when she<br> was tired from dancing or her head was spinning from too much<br> champagne--then she thought of Ashley. Frequently when she lay<br> drowsily in Rhett's arms with the moonlight streaming over the bed,<br> she thought how perfect life would be if it were only Ashley's arms<br> which held her so closely, if it were only Ashley who drew her<br> black hair across his face and wrapped it about his throat.<br><br> Once when she was thinking this, she sighed and turned her head<br> toward the window, and after a moment she felt the heavy arm<br> beneath her neck become like iron, and Rhett's voice spoke in the<br> stillness: ‘May God damn your cheating little soul to hell for all<br> eternity!’<br><br> And, getting up, he put on his clothes and left the room despite<br> her startled protests and questions. He reappeared the next<br> morning as she was breakfasting in her room, disheveled, quite<br> drunk and in his worst sarcastic mood, and neither made excuses nor<br> gave an account of his absence.<br><br> Scarlett asked no questions and was quite cool to him, as became an<br> injured wife, and when she had finished the meal, she dressed under<br> his bloodshot gaze and went shopping. He was gone when she<br> returned and did not appear again until time for supper.<br><br> It was a silent meal and Scarlett's temper was straining because it<br> was her last supper in New Orleans and she wanted to do justice to<br> the crawfish. And she could not enjoy it under his gaze.<br> Nevertheless she ate a large one, and drank a quantity of<br> champagne. Perhaps it was this combination that brought back her<br> old nightmare that evening, for she awoke, cold with sweat, sobbing<br> brokenly. She was back at Tara again and Tara was desolate.<br> Mother was dead and with her all the strength and wisdom of the<br> world. Nowhere in the world was there anyone to turn to, anyone to<br> rely upon. And something terrifying was pursuing her and she was<br> running, running till her heart was bursting, running in a thick<br> swimming fog, crying out, blindly seeking that nameless, unknown<br> haven of safety that was somewhere in the mist about her.<br><br> Rhett was leaning over her when she woke, and without a word he<br> picked her up in his arms like a child and held her close, his hard<br> muscles comforting, his wordless murmuring soothing, until her<br> sobbing ceased.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett. I was so cold and so hungry and so tired and I<br> couldn't find it. I ran through the mist and I ran but I couldn't<br> find it.’<br><br> ‘Find what, honey?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. I wish I did know.’<br><br> ‘Is it your old dream?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes!’<br><br> He gently placed her on the bed, fumbled in the darkness and lit a<br> candle. In the light his face with bloodshot eyes and harsh lines<br> was as unreadable as stone. His shirt, opened to the waist, showed<br> a brown chest covered with thick black hair. Scarlett, still<br> shaking with fright, thought how strong and unyielding that chest<br> was, and she whispered: ‘Hold me, Rhett.’<br><br> ‘Darling!’ he said swiftly, and picking her up he sat down in a<br> large chair, cradling her body against him.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, it's awful to be hungry.’<br><br> ‘It must be awful to dream of starvation after a seven-course<br> dinner including that enormous crawfish.’ He smiled but his eyes<br> were kind.<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, I just run and run and hunt and I can't ever find what<br> it is I'm hunting for. It's always hidden in the mist. I know if<br> I could find it, I'd be safe forever and ever and never be cold or<br> hungry again.’<br><br> ‘Is it a person or a thing you're hunting?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. I never thought about it. Rhett, do you think I'll<br> ever dream that I get there to safety?’<br><br> ‘No,’ he said, smoothing her tumbled hair, ‘I don't. Dreams aren't<br> like that. But I do think that if you get used to being safe and<br> warm and well fed in your everyday life, you'll stop dreaming that<br> dream. And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, you are so nice.’<br><br> ‘Thanks for the crumbs from your table, Mrs. Dives. Scarlett, I<br> want you to say to yourself every morning when you wake up: 'I<br> can't ever be hungry again and nothing can ever touch me so long as<br> Rhett is here and the United States government holds out.'‘<br><br> ‘The United States government?’ she questioned, sitting up,<br> startled, tears still on her cheeks.<br><br> ‘The ex-Confederate money has now become an honest woman. I<br> invested most of it in government bonds.’<br><br> ‘God's nightgown!’ cried Scarlett, sitting up in his lap, forgetful<br> of her recent terror. ‘Do you mean to tell me you've loaned your<br> money to the Yankees?’<br><br> ‘At a fair per cent.’<br><br> ‘I don't care if it's a hundred percent! You must sell them<br> immediately. The idea of letting the Yankees have the use of your<br> money!’<br><br> ‘And what must I do with it?’ he questioned with a smile, noting<br> that her eyes were no longer wide with fright.<br><br> ‘Why--why buy property at Five Points. I'll bet you could buy all<br> of Five Points with the money you have.’<br><br> ‘Thank you, but I wouldn't have Five Points. Now that the<br> Carpetbagger government has really gotten control of Georgia,<br> there's no telling what may happen. I wouldn't put anything beyond<br> the swarm of buzzards that's swooping down on Georgia now from<br> north, east, south and west. I'm playing along with them, you<br> understand, as a good Scallawag should do, but I don't trust them.<br> And I'm not putting my money in real estate. I prefer bonds. You<br> can hide them. You can't hide real estate very easily.’<br><br> ‘Do you think--’ she began, paling as she thought of the mills and<br> store.<br><br> ‘I don't know. But don't look so frightened, Scarlett. Our<br> charming new governor is a good friend of mine. It's just that<br> times are too uncertain now and I don't want much of my money tied<br> up in real estate.’<br><br> He shifted her to one knee and, leaning back, reached for a cigar<br> and lit it. She sat with her bare feet dangling, watching the play<br> of muscles on his brown chest, her terrors forgotten.<br><br> ‘And while we are on the subject of real estate, Scarlett,’ he<br> said, ‘I am going to build a house. You might have bullied Frank<br> into living in Miss Pitty's house, but not me. I don't believe I<br> could bear her vaporings three times a day and, moreover, I believe<br> Uncle Peter would assassinate me before he would let me live under<br> the sacred Hamilton roof. Miss Pitty can get Miss India Wilkes to<br> stay with her and keep the bogyman away. When we get back to<br> Atlanta we are going to stay in the bridal suite of the National<br> Hotel until our house is finished. Before we left Atlanta I was<br> dickering for that big lot on Peachtree, the one near the Leyden<br> house. You know the one I mean?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, how lovely! I do so want a house of my own. A great<br> big one!’<br><br> ‘Then at last we are agreed on something. What about a white<br> stucco with wrought-iron work like these Creole houses here?’<br><br> ‘Oh, no, Rhett. Not anything old fashioned like these New Orleans<br> houses. I know just what I want. It's the newest thing because I<br> saw a picture of it in--let me see--it was in that Harper's Weekly<br> I was looking at. It was modeled after a Swiss chalet.’<br><br> ‘A Swiss what?’<br><br> ‘A chalet.’<br><br> ‘Spell it.’<br><br> She complied.<br><br> ‘Oh,’ he said and stroked his mustache.<br><br> ‘It was lovely. It had a high mansard roof with a picket fence on<br> top and a tower made of fancy shingles at each end. And the towers<br> had windows with red and blue glass in them. It was so stylish<br> looking.’<br><br> ‘I suppose it had jigsaw work on the porch banisters?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘And a fringe of wooden scrollwork hanging from the roof of the<br> porch?’<br><br> ‘Yes. You must have seen one like it.’<br><br> ‘I have--but not in Switzerland. The Swiss are a very intelligent<br> race and keenly alive to architectural beauty. Do you really want<br> a house like that?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes!’<br><br> ‘I had hoped that association with me might improve your taste.<br> Why not a Creole house or a Colonial with six white columns?’<br><br> ‘I tell you I don't want anything tacky and old-fashioned looking.<br> And inside let's have red wall paper and red velvet portieres over<br> all the folding doors and oh, lots of expensive walnut furniture<br> and grand thick carpets and--oh, Rhett, everybody will be pea green<br> when they see our house!’<br><br> ‘It is very necessary that everyone shall be envious? Well, if you<br> like they shall be green. But, Scarlett, has it occurred to you<br> that it's hardly in good taste to furnish the house on so lavish a<br> scale when everyone is so poor?’<br><br> ‘I want it that way,’ she said obstinately. ‘I want to make<br> everybody who's been mean to me feel bad. And we'll give big<br> receptions that'll make the whole town wish they hadn't said such<br> nasty things.’<br><br> ‘But who will come to our receptions?’<br><br> ‘Why, everybody, of course.’<br><br> ‘I doubt it. The Old Guard dies but it never surrenders.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, how you run on! If you've got money, people always<br> like you.’<br><br> ‘Not Southerners. It's harder for speculators' money to get into<br> the best parlors than for the camel to go through the needle's eye.<br> And as for Scallawags--that's you and me, my pet--we'll be lucky if<br> we aren't spit upon. But if you'd like to try, I'll back you, my<br> dear, and I'm sure I shall enjoy your campaign intensely. And<br> while we are on the subject of money, let me make this clear to<br> you. You can have all the cash you want for the house and all you<br> want for your fal-lals. And if you like jewelry, you can have it<br> but I'm going to pick it out. You have such execrable taste, my<br> pet. And anything you want for Wade or Ella. And if Will Benteen<br> can't make a go of the cotton, I'm willing to chip in and help out<br> on that white elephant in Clayton County that you love so much.<br> That's fair enough, isn't it?’<br><br> ‘Of course. You're very generous.’<br><br> ‘But listen closely. Not one cent for the store and not one cent<br> for that kindling factory of yours.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ said Scarlett, her face falling. All during the honeymoon<br> she had been thinking how she could bring up the subject of the<br> thousand dollars she needed to buy fifty feet more of land to<br> enlarge her lumber yard.<br><br> ‘I thought you always bragged about being broad minded and not<br> caring what people said about my running a business, and you're<br> just like every other man--so afraid people will say I wear the<br> pants in the family.’<br><br> ‘There's never going to be any doubt in anybody's mind about who<br> wears the pants in the Butler family,’ drawled Rhett. ‘I don't<br> care what fools say. In fact, I'm ill bred enough to be proud of<br> having a smart wife. I want you to keep on running the store and<br> the mills. They are your children's. When Wade grows up he won't<br> feel right about being supported by his stepfather, and then he can<br> take over the management. But not one cent of mine goes into<br> either business.’<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘Because I don't care to contribute to the support of Ashley<br> Wilkes.’<br><br> ‘Are you going to begin that again?’<br><br> ‘No. But you asked my reasons and I have given them. And another<br> thing. Don't think you can juggle books on me and lie about how<br> much your clothes cost and how much it takes to run the house, so<br> that you can use the money to buy more mules or another mill for<br> Ashley. I intend to look over and carefully check your expenditures<br> and I know what things cost. Oh, don't get insulted. You'd do it.<br> I wouldn't put it beyond you. In fact, I wouldn't put anything<br> beyond you where either Tara or Ashley is concerned. I don't mind<br> Tara. But I must draw the line at Ashley. I'm riding you with a<br> slack rein, my pet, but don't forget that I'm riding with curb and<br> spurs just the same.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XLIX<br><br> <br> Mrs. Elsing cocked her ear toward the hall. Hearing Melanie's<br> steps die away into the kitchen where rattling dishes and clinking<br> silverware gave promise of refreshments, she turned and spoke<br> softly to the ladies who sat in a circle in the parlor, their<br> sewing baskets in their laps.<br><br> ‘Personally, I do not intend to call on Scarlett now or ever,’ she<br> said, the chill elegance of her face colder than usual.<br><br> The other members of the Ladies' Sewing Circle for the Widows and<br> Orphans of the Confederacy eagerly laid down their needles and<br> edged their rocking chairs closer. All the ladies had been<br> bursting to discuss Scarlett and Rhett but Melanie's presence<br> prevented it. Just the day before, the couple had returned from<br> New Orleans and they were occupying the bridal suite at the<br> National Hotel.<br><br> ‘Hugh says that I must call out of courtesy for the way Captain<br> Butler saved his life,’ Mrs. Elsing continued. ‘And poor Fanny<br> sides with him and says she will call too. I said to her 'Fanny,'<br> I said, 'if it wasn't for Scarlett, Tommy would be alive this<br> minute. It is an insult to his memory to call.' And Fanny had no<br> better sense than to say, 'Mother, I'm not calling on Scarlett.<br> I'm calling on Captain Butler. He tried his best to save Tommy and<br> it wasn't his fault if he failed.'‘<br><br> ‘How silly young people are!’ said Mrs. Merriwether. ‘Call,<br> indeed!’ Her stout bosom swelled indignantly as she remembered<br> Scarlett's rude reception of her advice on marrying Rhett. ‘My<br> Maybelle is just as silly as your Fanny. She says she and Rene<br> will call, because Captain Butler kept Rene from getting hanged.<br> And I said if it hadn't been for Scarlett exposing herself, Rene<br> would never have been in any danger. And Father Merriwether<br> intends to call and he talks like he was in his dotage and says<br> he's grateful to that scoundrel, even if I'm not. I vow, since<br> Father Merriwether was in that Watling creature's house he has<br> acted in a disgraceful way. Call, indeed! I certainly shan't<br> call. Scarlett has outlawed herself by marrying such a man. He<br> was bad enough when he was a speculator during the war and making<br> money out of our hunger but now that he is hand in glove with the<br> Carpetbaggers and Scallawags and a friend--actually a friend of<br> that odious wretch, Governor Bullock-- Call, indeed!’<br><br> Mrs. Bonnell sighed. She was a plump brown wren of a woman with a<br> cheerful face.<br><br> ‘They'll only call once, for courtesy, Dolly. I don't know that I<br> blame them. I've heard that all the men who were out that night<br> intend to call, and I think they should. Somehow, it's hard for me<br> to think that Scarlett is her mother's child. I went to school<br> with Ellen Robillard in Savannah and there was never a lovelier<br> girl than she was and she was very dear to me. If only her father<br> had not opposed her match with her cousin, Philippe Robillard!<br> There was nothing really wrong with the boy--boys must sow their<br> wild oats. But Ellen must run off and marry old man O'Hara and<br> have a daughter like Scarlett. But really, I feel that I must call<br> once out of memory to Ellen.’<br><br> ‘Sentimental nonsense!’ snorted Mrs. Merriwether with vigor.<br> ‘Kitty Bonnell, are you going to call on a woman who married a bare<br> year after her husband's death? A woman--’<br><br> ‘And she really killed Mr. Kennedy,’ interrupted India. Her voice<br> was cool but acid. Whenever she thought of Scarlett it was hard<br> for her even to be polite, remembering, always remembering Stuart<br> Tarleton. ‘And I have always thought there was more between her<br> and that Butler man before Mr. Kennedy was killed than most people<br> suspected.’<br><br> Before the ladies could recover from their shocked astonishment at<br> her statement and at a spinster mentioning such a matter, Melanie<br> was standing in the doorway. So engrossed had they been in their<br> gossip that they had not heard her light tread and now, confronted<br> by their hostess, they looked like whispering schoolgirls caught by<br> a teacher. Alarm was added to consternation at the change in<br> Melanie's face. She was pink with righteous anger, her gentle eyes<br> snapping fire, her nostrils quivering. No one had ever seen<br> Melanie angry before. Not a lady present thought her capable of<br> wrath. They all loved her but they thought her the sweetest, most<br> pliable of young women, deferential to her elders and without any<br> opinions of her own.<br><br> ‘How dare you, India?’ she questioned in a low voice that shook.<br> ‘Where will your jealousy lead you? For shame!’<br><br> India's face went white but her head was high.<br><br> ‘I retract nothing,’ she said briefly. But her mind was seething.<br><br> ‘Jealous, am I?’ she thought. With the memory of Stuart Tarleton<br> and of Honey and Charles, didn't she have good reason to be jealous<br> of Scarlett? Didn't she have good reason to hate her, especially<br> now that she had a suspicion that Scarlett had somehow entangled<br> Ashley in her web? She thought: ‘There's plenty I could tell you<br> about Ashley and your precious Scarlett.’ India was torn between<br> the desire to shield Ashley by her silence and to extricate him by<br> telling all her suspicions to Melanie and the whole world. That<br> would force Scarlett to release whatever hold she had on Ashley.<br> But this was not the time. She had nothing definite, only<br> suspicions.<br><br> ‘I retract nothing,’ she repeated.<br><br> ‘Then it is fortunate that you are no longer living under my roof,’<br> said Melanie and her words were cold.<br><br> India leaped to her feet, red flooding her sallow face.<br><br> ‘Melanie, you--my sister-in-law--you aren't going to quarrel with<br> me over that fast piece--’<br><br> ‘Scarlett is my sister-in-law, too,’ said Melanie, meeting India's<br> eyes squarely as though they were strangers. ‘And dearer to me<br> than any blood sister could ever be. If you are so forgetful of my<br> favors at her hands, I am not. She stayed with me through the<br> whole siege when she could have gone home, when even Aunt Pitty had<br> run away to Macon. She brought my baby for me when the Yankees<br> were almost in Atlanta and she burdened herself with me and Beau<br> all that dreadful trip to Tara when she could have left me here in<br> a hospital for the Yankees to get me. And she nursed and fed me,<br> even if she was tired and even if she went hungry. Because I was<br> sick and weak, I had the best mattress at Tara. When I could walk,<br> I had the only whole pair of shoes. You can forget those things<br> she did for me, India, but I cannot. And when Ashley came home,<br> sick, discouraged, without a home, without a cent in his pockets,<br> she took him in like a sister. And when we thought we would have<br> to go North and it was breaking our hearts to leave Georgia,<br> Scarlett stepped in and gave him the mill to run. And Captain<br> Butler saved Ashley's life out of the kindness of his heart.<br> Certainly Ashley had no claim on him! And I am grateful, grateful<br> to Scarlett and to Captain Butler. But you, India! How can you<br> forget the favors Scarlett has done me and Ashley? How can you<br> hold your brother's life so cheap as to cast slurs on the man who<br> saved him? If you went down on your knees to Captain Butler and<br> Scarlett, it would not be enough.’<br><br> ‘Now, Melly,’ began Mrs. Merriwether briskly, for she had recovered<br> her composure, ‘that's no way to talk to India.’<br><br> ‘I heard what you said about Scarlett too,’ cried Melanie, swinging<br> on the stout old lady with the air of a duelist who, having<br> withdrawn a blade from one prostrate opponent, turns hungrily<br> toward another. ‘And you too, Mrs. Elsing. What you think of her<br> in your own petty minds, I do not care, for that is your business.<br> But what you say about her in my own house or in my own hearing,<br> ever, is my business. But how can you even think such dreadful<br> things, much less say them? Are your men so cheap to you that you<br> would rather see them dead than alive? Have you no gratitude to<br> the man who saved them and saved them at risk of his own life? The<br> Yankees might easily have thought him a member of the Klan if the<br> whole truth had come out! They might have hanged him. But he<br> risked himself for your men. For your father-in-law, Mrs.<br> Merriwether, and your son-in-law and your two nephews, too. And<br> your brother, Mrs. Bonnell, and your son and son-in-law, Mrs.<br> Elsing. Ingrates, that's what you are! I ask an apology from all<br> of you.’<br><br> Mrs. Elsing was on her feet cramming her sewing into her box, her<br> mouth set.<br><br> ‘If anyone had ever told me that you could be so ill bred, Melly--<br> No, I will not apologize. India is right. Scarlett is a flighty,<br> fast bit of baggage. I can't forget how she acted during the war.<br> And I can't forget how poor white trashy she's acted since she got<br> a little money--’<br><br> ‘What you can't forget,’ cut in Melanie, clenching her small fists<br> against her sides, ‘is that she demoted Hugh because he wasn't<br> smart enough to run her mill.’<br><br> ‘Melly!’ moaned a chorus of voices.<br><br> Mrs. Elsing's head jerked up and she started toward the door. With<br> her hand on the knob of the front door, she stopped and turned.<br><br> ‘Melly,’ she said and her voice softened, ‘honey, this breaks my<br> heart. I was your mother's best friend and I helped Dr. Meade<br> bring you into this world and I've loved you like you were mine.<br> If it were something that mattered it wouldn't be so hard to hear<br> you talk like this. But about a woman like Scarlett O'Hara who'd<br> just as soon do you a dirty turn as the next of us--’<br><br> Tears had started in Melanie's eyes at the first words Mrs. Elsing<br> spoke, but her face hardened when the old lady had finished.<br><br> ‘I want it understood,’ she said, ‘that any of you who do not call<br> on Scarlett need never, never call on me.’<br><br> There was a loud murmur of voices, confusion as the ladies got to<br> their feet. Mrs. Elsing dropped her sewing box on the floor and<br> came back into the room, her false fringe jerking awry.<br><br> ‘I won't have it!’ she cried. ‘I won't have it! You are beside<br> yourself, Melly, and I don't hold you responsible. You shall be my<br> friend and I shall be yours. I refuse to let this come between<br> us.’<br><br> She was crying and somehow, Melanie was in her arms, crying too,<br> but declaring between sobs that she meant every word she said.<br> Several of the other ladies burst into tears and Mrs. Merriwether,<br> trumpeting loudly into her handkerchief, embraced both Mrs. Elsing<br> and Melanie. Aunt Pitty, who had been a petrified witness to the<br> whole scene, suddenly slid to the floor in what was one of the few<br> real fainting spells she had ever had. Amid the tears and<br> confusion and kissing and scurrying for smelling salts and brandy,<br> there was only one calm face, one dry pair of eyes. India Wilkes<br> took her departure unnoticed by anyone.<br><br> Grandpa Merriwether, meeting Uncle Henry Hamilton in the Girl of<br> the Period Saloon several hours later, related the happenings of<br> the morning which he had heard from Mrs. Merriweather. He told it<br> with relish for he was delighted that someone had the courage to<br> face down his redoubtable daughter-in-law. Certainly, he had never<br> had such courage.<br><br> ‘Well, what did the pack of silly fools finally decide to do?’<br> asked Uncle Henry irritably.<br><br> ‘I dunno for sure,’ said Grandpa, ‘but it looks to me like Melly<br> won hands down on this go-round. I'll bet they'll all call, at<br> least once. Folks set a store by that niece of yours, Henry.’<br><br> ‘Melly's a fool and the ladies are right. Scarlett is a slick<br> piece of baggage and I don't see why Charlie ever married her,’<br> said Uncle Henry gloomily. ‘But Melly was right too, in a way.<br> It's only decent that the families of the men Captain Butler saved<br> should call. When you come right down to it, I haven't got so much<br> against Butler. He showed himself a fine man that night he saved<br> our hides. It's Scarlett who sticks under my tail like a<br> cocklebur. She's a sight too smart for her own good. Well, I've<br> got to call. Scallawag or not, Scarlett is my niece by marriage,<br> after all. I was aiming to call this afternoon.’<br><br> ‘I'll go with you, Henry. Dolly will be fit to be tied when she<br> hears I've gone. Wait till I get one more drink.’<br><br> ‘No, we'll get a drink off Captain Butler. I'll say this for him,<br> he always has good licker.’<br><br> <br><br> Rhett had said that the Old Guard would never surrender and he was<br> right. He knew how little significance there was to the few calls<br> made upon them, and he knew why the calls were made. The families<br> of the men who had been in the ill-starred Klan foray did call<br> first, but called with obvious infrequency thereafter. And they<br> did not invite the Rhett Butlers to their homes.<br><br> Rhett said they would not have come at all, except for fear of<br> violence at the hands of Melanie. Where he got this idea, Scarlett<br> did not know but she dismissed it with the contempt it deserved.<br> For what possible influence could Melanie have on people like Mrs.<br> Elsing and Mrs. Merriwether? That they did not call again worried<br> her very little; in fact, their absence was hardly noticed, for her<br> suite was crowded with guests of another type. ‘New people,’<br> established Atlantians called them, when they were not calling them<br> something less polite.<br><br> There were many ‘new people’ staying at the National Hotel who,<br> like Rhett and Scarlett, were waiting for their houses to be<br> completed. They were gay, wealthy people, very much like Rhett's<br> New Orleans friends, elegant of dress, free with their money, vague<br> as to their antecedents. All the men were Republicans and were ‘in<br> Atlanta on business connected with the state government.’ Just<br> what the business was, Scarlett did not know and did not trouble to<br> learn.<br><br> Rhett could have told her exactly what it was--the same business<br> that buzzards have with dying animals. They smelled death from<br> afar and were drawn unerringly to it, to gorge themselves.<br> Government of Georgia by its own citizens was dead, the state was<br> helpless and the adventurers were swarming in.<br><br> The wives of Rhett's Scallawag and Carpetbagger friends called in<br> droves and so did the ‘new people’ she had met when she sold lumber<br> for their homes. Rhett said that, having done business with them,<br> she should receive them and, having received them, she found them<br> pleasant company. They wore lovely clothes and never talked about<br> the war or hard times, but confined the conversation to fashions,<br> scandals and whist. Scarlett had never played cards before and she<br> took to whist with joy, becoming a good player in a short time.<br><br> Whenever she was at the hotel there was a crowd of whist players in<br> her suite. But she was not often in her suite these days, for she<br> was too busy with the building of her new house to be bothered with<br> callers. These days she did not much care whether she had callers<br> or not. She wanted to delay her social activities until the day<br> when the house was finished and she could emerge as the mistress of<br> Atlanta's largest mansion, the hostess of the town's most elaborate<br> entertainments.<br><br> Through the long warm days she watched her red stone and gray<br> shingle house rise grandly, to tower above any other house on<br> Peachtree Street. Forgetful of the store and the mills, she spent<br> her time on the lot, arguing with carpenters, bickering with<br> masons, harrying the contractor. As the walls went swiftly up she<br> thought with satisfaction that, when finished, it would be larger<br> and finer looking than any other house in town. It would be even<br> more imposing than the near-by James residence which had just been<br> purchased for the official mansion of Governor Bullock.<br><br> The governor's mansion was brave with jigsaw work on banisters and<br> eaves, but the intricate scrollwork on Scarlett's house put the<br> mansion to shame. The mansion had a ballroom, but it looked like a<br> billiard table compared with the enormous room that covered the<br> entire third floor of Scarlett's house. In fact, her house had<br> more of everything than the mansion, or any other house in town for<br> that matter, more cupolas and turrets and towers and balconies and<br> lightning rods and far more windows with colored panes.<br><br> A veranda encircled the entire house, and four flights of steps on<br> the four sides of the building led up to it. The yard was wide and<br> green and scattered about it were rustic iron benches, an iron<br> summerhouse, fashionably called a ‘gazebo’ which, Scarlett had been<br> assured, was of pure Gothic design, and two large iron statues, one<br> a stag and the other a mastiff as large as a Shetland pony. To<br> Wade and Ella, a little dazzled by the size, splendor and fashionable<br> dark gloom of their new home, these two metal animals were the only<br> cheerful notes.<br><br> Within, the house was furnished as Scarlett had desired, with thick<br> red carpeting which ran from wall to wall, red velvet portieres and<br> the newest of highly varnished black-walnut furniture, carved<br> wherever there was an inch for carving and upholstered in such<br> slick horsehair that ladies had to deposit themselves thereon with<br> great care for fear of sliding off. Everywhere on the walls were<br> gilt-framed mirrors and long pier glasses--as many, Rhett said<br> idly, as there were in Belle Watling's establishment. Interspread<br> were steel engravings in heavy frames, some of them eight feet<br> long, which Scarlett had ordered especially from New York. The<br> walls were covered with rich dark paper, the ceilings were high and<br> the house was always dim, for the windows were overdraped with<br> plum-colored plush hangings that shut out most of the sunlight.<br><br> All in all it was an establishment to take one's breath away and<br> Scarlett, stepping on the soft carpets and sinking into the embrace<br> of the deep feather beds, remembered the cold floors and the straw-<br> stuffed bedticks of Tara and was satisfied. She thought it the<br> most beautiful and most elegantly furnished house she had ever<br> seen, but Rhett said it was a nightmare. However, if it made her<br> happy, she was welcome to it.<br><br> ‘A stranger without being told a word about us would know this<br> house was built with ill-gotten gains,’ he said. ‘You know,<br> Scarlett, money ill come by never comes to good and this house is<br> proof of the axiom. It's just the kind of house a profiteer would<br> build.’<br><br> But Scarlett, abrim with pride and happiness and full of plans for<br> the entertainments she would give when they were thoroughly settled<br> in the house, only pinched his ear playfully and said: ‘Fiddle-<br> dee-dee! How you do run on!’<br><br> She knew, by now, that Rhett loved to take her down a peg, and<br> would spoil her fun whenever he could, if she lent an attentive ear<br> to his jibes. Should she take him seriously, she would be forced<br> to quarrel with him and she did not care to match swords, for she<br> always came off second best. So she hardly ever listened to<br> anything he said, and what she was forced to hear she tried to turn<br> off as a joke. At least, she tried for a while.<br><br> During their honeymoon and for the greater part of their stay at<br> the National Hotel, they had lived together with amiability. But<br> scarcely had they moved into the new house and Scarlett gathered<br> her new friends about her, when sudden sharp quarrels sprang up<br> between them. They were brief quarrels, short lived because it was<br> impossible to keep a quarrel going with Rhett, who remained coolly<br> indifferent to her hot words and waited his chance to pink her in<br> an unguarded spot. She quarreled; Rhett did not. He only stated<br> his unequivocal opinion of herself, her actions, her house and her<br> new friends. And some of his opinions were of such a nature that<br> she could no longer ignore them and treat them as jokes.<br><br> For instance when she decided to change the name of ‘Kennedy's<br> General Store’ to something more edifying, she asked him to think<br> of a title that would include the word ‘emporium.’ Rhett suggested<br> ‘Caveat Emptorium,’ assuring her that it would be a title most in<br> keeping with the type of goods sold in the store. She thought it<br> had an imposing sound and even went so far as to have the sign<br> painted, when Ashley Wilkes, embarrassed, translated the real<br> meaning. And Rhett had roared at her rage.<br><br> And there was the way he treated Mammy. Mammy had never yielded an<br> inch from her stand that Rhett was a mule in horse harness. She<br> was polite but cold to Rhett. She always called him ‘Cap'n<br> Butler,’ never ‘Mist' Rhett.’ She never even dropped a curtsy when<br> Rhett presented her with the red petticoat and she never wore it<br> either. She kept Ella and Wade out of Rhett's way whenever she<br> could, despite the fact that Wade adored Uncle Rhett and Rhett was<br> obviously fond of the boy. But instead of discharging Mammy or<br> being short and stern with her, Rhett treated her with the utmost<br> deference, with far more courtesy than he treated any of the ladies<br> of Scarlett's recent acquaintance. In fact, with more courtesy<br> than he treated Scarlett herself. He always asked Mammy's<br> permission to take Wade riding and consulted with her before he<br> bought Ella dolls. And Mammy was hardly polite to him.<br><br> Scarlett felt that Rhett should be firm with Mammy, as became the<br> head of the house, but Rhett only laughed and said that Mammy was<br> the real head of the house.<br><br> He infuriated Scarlett by saying coolly that he was preparing to be<br> very sorry for her some years hence, when the Republican rule was<br> gone from Georgia and the Democrats back in power.<br><br> ‘When the Democrats get a governor and a legislature of their own,<br> all your new vulgar Republican friends will be wiped off the chess<br> board and sent back to minding bars and emptying slops where they<br> belong. And you'll be left out on the end of a limb, with never a<br> Democratic friend or a Republican either. Well, take no thought of<br> the morrow.’<br><br> Scarlett laughed, and with some justice, for at that time, Bullock<br> was safe in the governor's chair, twenty-seven negroes were in the<br> legislature and thousands of the Democratic voters of Georgia were<br> disfranchised.<br><br> ‘The Democrats will never get back. All they do is make Yankees<br> madder and put off the day when they could get back. All they do<br> is talk big and run around at night Ku Kluxing.’<br><br> ‘They will get back. I know Southerners. I know Georgians. They<br> are a tough and bullheaded lot. If they've got to fight another<br> war to get back, they'll fight another war. If they've got to buy<br> black votes like the Yankees have done, then they will buy black<br> votes. If they've got to vote ten thousand dead men like the<br> Yankees did, every corpse in every cemetery in Georgia will be at<br> the polls. Things are going to get so bad under the benign rule of<br> our good friend Rufus Bullock that Georgia is going to vomit him<br> up.<br><br> ‘Rhett, don't use such vulgar words!’ cried Scarlett. ‘You talk<br> like I wouldn't be glad to see the Democrats come back! And you<br> know that isn't so! I'd be very glad to see them back. Do you<br> think I like to see these soldiers hanging around, reminding me of--<br> do you think I like--why, I'm a Georgian, too! I'd like to see<br> the Democrats get back. But they won't. Not ever. And even if<br> they did, how would that affect my friends? They'd still have<br> their money, wouldn't they?’<br><br> ‘If they kept their money. But I doubt the ability of any of them<br> to keep money more than five years at the rate they're spending.<br> Easy come, easy go. Their money won't do them any good. Any more<br> than my money has done you any good. It certainly hasn't made a<br> horse out of you yet, has it, my pretty mule?’<br><br> The quarrel which sprang from this last remark lasted for days.<br> After the fourth day of Scarlett's sulks and obvious silent demands<br> for an apology, Rhett went to New Orleans, taking Wade with him,<br> over Mammy's protests, and he stayed away until Scarlett's tantrum<br> had passed. But the sting of not humbling him remained with her.<br><br> When he came back from New Orleans, cool and bland, she swallowed<br> her anger as best she could, pushing it into the back of her mind<br> to be thought of at some later date. She did not want to bother<br> with anything unpleasant now. She wanted to be happy for her mind<br> was full of the first party she would give in the new house. It<br> would be an enormous night reception with palms and an orchestra<br> and all the porches shrouded in canvas, and a collation that made<br> her mouth water in anticipation. To it she intended to invite<br> everyone she had ever known in Atlanta, all the old friends and all<br> the new and charming ones she had met since returning from her<br> honeymoon. The excitement of the party banished, for the most<br> part, the memory of Rhett's barbs and she was happy, happier than<br> she had been in years as she planned her reception.<br><br> Oh, what fun it was to be rich! To give parties and never count<br> the cost! To buy the most expensive furniture and dresses and food<br> and never think about the bills! How marvelous to be able to send<br> tidy checks to Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie in Charleston, and to<br> Will at Tara! Oh, the jealous fools who said money wasn't<br> everything! How perverse of Rhett to say that it had done nothing<br> for her!<br><br> <br><br> Scarlett issued cards of invitation to all her friends and<br> acquaintances, old and new, even those she did not like. She did<br> not except even Mrs. Merriwether who had been almost rude when she<br> called on her at the National Hotel or Mrs. Elsing who had been<br> cool to frigidness. She invited Mrs. Meade and Mrs. Whiting who<br> she knew disliked her and who she knew would be embarrassed because<br> they did not have the proper clothes to wear to so elegant a<br> function. For Scarlett's housewarming, or ‘crush,’ as it was<br> fashionable to call such evening parties, half-reception, half-<br> ball, was by far the most elaborate affair Atlanta had ever seen.<br><br> That night the house and canvas-covered veranda were filled with<br> guests who drank her champagne punch and ate her patties and<br> creamed oysters and danced to the music of the orchestra that was<br> carefully screened by a wall of palms and rubber plants. But none<br> of those whom Rhett had termed the ‘Old Guard’ were present except<br> Melanie and Ashley, Aunt Pitty and Uncle Henry, Dr. and Mrs. Meade<br> and Grandpa Merriwether.<br><br> Many of the Old Guard had reluctantly decided to attend the<br> ‘crush.’ Some had accepted because of Melanie's attitude, others<br> because they felt they owed Rhett a debt for saving their lives and<br> those of their relatives. But, two days before the function, a<br> rumor went about Atlanta that Governor Bullock had been invited.<br> The Old Guard signified their disapproval by a sheaf of cards,<br> regretting their inability to accept Scarlett's kind invitation.<br> And the small group of old friends who did attend took their<br> departure, embarrassed but firm, as soon as the governor entered<br> Scarlett's house.<br><br> Scarlett was so bewildered and infuriated at these slights that the<br> party was utterly ruined for her. Her elegant ‘crush’! She had<br> planned it so lovingly and so few old friends and no old enemies<br> had been there to see how wonderful it was! After the last guest<br> had gone home at dawn, she would have cried and stormed had she not<br> been afraid that Rhett would roar with laughter, afraid that she<br> would read ‘I told you so’ in his dancing black eyes, even if he<br> did not speak the words. So she swallowed her wrath with poor<br> grace and pretended indifference.<br><br> Only to Melanie, the next morning, did she permit herself the<br> luxury of exploding.<br><br> ‘You insulted me, Melly Wilkes, and you made Ashley and the others<br> insult me! You know they'd have never gone home so soon if you<br> hadn't dragged them. Oh, I saw you! Just when I started to bring<br> Governor Bullock over to present him to you, you ran like a<br> rabbit!’<br><br> ‘I did not believe--I could not believe that he would really be<br> present,’ answered Melanie unhappily. ‘Even though everybody said--’<br><br> ‘Everybody? So everybody's been clacking and blabbing about me,<br> have they?’ cried Scarlett furiously. ‘Do you mean to tell me if<br> you'd known the governor was going to be present, you wouldn't have<br> come either?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Melanie in a low voice, her eyes on the floor. ‘Darling,<br> I just wouldn't have come.’<br><br> ‘Great balls of fire! So you'd have insulted me like everybody<br> else did!’<br><br> ‘Oh, mercy!’ cried Melly, in real distress. ‘I didn't mean to hurt<br> you. You're my own sister, darling, my own Charlie's widow and I--’<br><br> She put a timid hand on Scarlett's arm. But Scarlett flung it off,<br> wishing fervently that she could roar as loudly as Gerald used to<br> roar when in a temper. But Melanie faced her wrath. And as she<br> looked into Scarlett's stormy green eyes, her slight shoulders<br> straightened and a mantle of dignity, strangely at variance with<br> her childish face and figure, fell upon her.<br><br> ‘I'm sorry you're hurt, my dear, but I cannot meet Governor Bullock<br> or any Republican or any Scallawag. I will not meet them, in your<br> house or any other house. No, not even if I have to--if I have to--’<br> Melanie cast about her for the worst thing she could think of--<br> ‘Not even if I have to be rude.’<br><br> ‘Are you criticizing my friends?’<br><br> ‘No, dear. But they are your friends and not mine.’<br><br> ‘Are you criticizing me for having the governor at my house?’<br><br> Cornered, Melanie still met Scarlett's eyes unwaveringly.<br><br> ‘Darling, what you do, you always do for a good reason and I love<br> you and trust you and it is not for me to criticize. And I will<br> not permit anyone to criticize you in my hearing. But, oh,<br> Scarlett!’ Suddenly words began to bubble out, swift hot words and<br> there was inflexible hate in the low voice. ‘Can you forget what<br> these people did to us? Can you forget darling Charlie dead and<br> Ashley's health ruined and Twelve Oaks burned? Oh, Scarlett, you<br> can't forget that terrible man you shot with your mother's sewing<br> box in his hands! You can't forget Sherman's men at Tara and how<br> they even stole our underwear! And tried to burn the place down<br> and actually handled my father's sword! Oh, Scarlett, it was these<br> same people who robbed us and tortured us and left us to starve<br> that you invited to your party! The same people who have set the<br> darkies up to lord it over us, who are robbing us and keeping our<br> men from voting! I can't forget. I won't forget. I won't let my<br> Beau forget and I'll teach my grandchildren to hate these people--<br> and my grandchildren's grandchildren if God lets me live that long!<br> Scarlett, how can you forget?’<br><br> Melanie paused for breath and Scarlett stared at her, startled out<br> of her own anger by the quivering note of violence in Melanie's<br> voice.<br><br> ‘Do you think I'm a fool?’ she questioned impatiently. ‘Of course,<br> I remember! But all that's past, Melly. It's up to us to make the<br> best of things and I'm trying to do it. Governor Bullock and some<br> of the nicer Republicans can help us a lot if we handle them<br> right.’<br><br> ‘There are no nice Republicans,’ said Melanie flatly. ‘And I don't<br> want their help. And I don't intend to make the best of things--if<br> they are Yankee things.’<br><br> ‘Good Heaven, Melly, why get in such a pet?’<br><br> ‘Oh!’ cried Melanie, looking conscience stricken. ‘How I have run<br> on! Scarlett, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings or to criticize.<br> Everybody thinks differently and everybody's got a right to their<br> own opinion. Now, dear, I love you and you know I love you and<br> nothing you could ever do would make me change. And you still love<br> me, don't you? I haven't made you hate me, have I? Scarlett, I<br> couldn't stand it if anything ever came between us--after all we've<br> been through together! Say it's all right.’<br><br> ‘Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly, what a tempest you make in a teapot,’ said<br> Scarlett grudgingly, but she did not throw off the hand that stole<br> around her waist.<br><br> ‘Now, we're all right again,’ said Melanie pleasedly but she added<br> softly, ‘I want us to visit each other just like we always did,<br> darling. Just you let me know what days Republicans and Scallawags<br> are coming to see you and I'll stay at home on those days.’<br><br> ‘It's a matter of supreme indifference to me whether you come or<br> not,’ said Scarlett, putting on her bonnet and going home in a<br> huff. There was some satisfaction to her wounded vanity in the<br> hurt look on Melanie's face.<br><br> <br><br> In the weeks that followed her first party, Scarlett was hard put<br> to keep up her pretense of supreme indifference to public opinion.<br> When she did not receive calls from old friends, except Melanie and<br> Pitty and Uncle Henry and Ashley, and did not get cards to their<br> modest entertainments, she was genuinely puzzled and hurt. Had she<br> not gone out of her way to bury old hatchets and show these people<br> that she bore them no ill will for their gossiping and backbiting?<br> Surely they must know that she didn't like Governor Bullock any<br> more than they did but that it was expedient to be nice to him.<br> The idiots! If everybody would be nice to the Republicans, Georgia<br> would get out of the fix she was in very quickly.<br><br> She did not realize then that with one stroke she had cut forever<br> any fragile tie that still bound her to the old days, to old<br> friends. Not even Melanie's influence could repair the break of<br> that gossamer thread. And Melanie, bewildered, broken hearted but<br> still loyal, did not try to repair it. Even had Scarlett wanted to<br> turn back to old ways, old friends, there was no turning back<br> possible now. The face of the town was set against her as stonily<br> as granite. The hate that enveloped the Bullock regime enveloped<br> her too, a hate that had little fire and fury in it but much cold<br> implacability. Scarlett had cast her lot with the enemy and,<br> whatever her birth and family connections, she was now in the<br> category of a turncoat, a nigger lover, a traitor, a Republican--<br> and a Scallawag.<br><br> After a miserable while, Scarlett's pretended indifference gave way<br> to the real thing. She had never been one to worry long over the<br> vagaries of human conduct or to be cast down for long if one line<br> of action failed. Soon she did not care what the Merriwethers, the<br> Elsings, the Whitings, the Bonnells, the Meades and others thought<br> of her. At least, Melanie called, bringing Ashley, and Ashley was<br> the one who mattered the most. And there were other people in<br> Atlanta who would come to her parties, other people far more<br> congenial than those hide-bound old hens. Any time she wanted to<br> fill her house with guests, she could do so and these guests would<br> be far more entertaining, far more handsomely dressed than those<br> prissy, strait-laced old fools who disapproved of her.<br><br> These people were newcomers to Atlanta. Some of them were<br> acquaintances of Rhett, some associated with him in those<br> mysterious affairs which he referred to as ‘mere business, my pet.’<br> Some were couples Scarlett had met when she was living at the<br> National Hotel and some were Governor Bullock's appointees.<br><br> The set with which she was now moving was a motley crew. Among<br> them were the Gelerts who had lived in a dozen different states and<br> who apparently had left each one hastily upon detection of their<br> swindling schemes; the Conningtons whose connection with the<br> Freedmen's Bureau in a distant state had been highly lucrative at<br> the expense of the ignorant blacks they were supposed to protect;<br> the Deals who had sold ‘cardboard’ shoes to the Confederate<br> government until it became necessary for them to spend the last<br> year of the war in Europe; the Hundons who had police records in<br> many cities but nevertheless were often successful bidders on state<br> contracts; the Carahans who had gotten their start in a gambling<br> house and now were gambling for bigger stakes in the building of<br> nonexistent railroads with the state's money; the Flahertys who had<br> bought salt at one cent a pound in 1861 and made a fortune when<br> salt went to fifty cents in 1863, and the Barts who had owned the<br> largest brothel in a Northern metropolis during the war and now<br> were moving in the best circles of Carpetbagger society.<br><br> Such people were Scarlett's intimates now, but those who attended<br> her larger receptions included others of some culture and<br> refinement, many of excellent families. In addition to the<br> Carpetbag gentry, substantial people from the North were moving<br> into Atlanta, attracted by the never ceasing business activity of<br> the town in this period of rebuilding and expansion. Yankee<br> families of wealth sent young sons to the South to pioneer on the<br> new frontier, and Yankee officers after their discharge took up<br> permanent residence in the town they had fought so hard to capture.<br> At first, strangers in a strange town, they were glad to accept<br> invitations to the lavish entertainments of the wealthy and<br> hospitable Mrs. Butler, but they soon drifted out of her set. They<br> were good people and they needed only a short acquaintance with<br> Carpetbaggers and Carpetbag rule to become as resentful of them as<br> the native Georgians were. Many became Democrats and more Southern<br> than the Southerners.<br><br> Other misfits in Scarlett's circle remained there only because they<br> were not welcome elsewhere. They would have much preferred the<br> quiet parlors of the Old Guard, but the Old Guard would have none<br> of them. Among these were the Yankee schoolmarms who had come<br> South imbued with the desire to uplift the Negro and the Scallawags<br> who had been born good Democrats but had turned Republican after<br> the surrender.<br><br> It was hard to say which class was more cordially hated by the<br> settled citizenry, the impractical Yankee schoolmarms or the<br> Scallawags, but the balance probably fell with the latter. The<br> schoolmarms could be dismissed with, ‘Well, what can you expect of<br> nigger-loving Yankees? Of course they think the nigger is just as<br> good as they are!’ But for those Georgians who had turned<br> Republican for personal gain, there was no excuse.<br><br> ‘Starving is good enough for us. It ought to be good enough for<br> you,’ was the way the Old Guard felt. Many ex-Confederate<br> soldiers, knowing the frantic fear of men who saw their families in<br> want, were more tolerant of former comrades who had changed<br> political colors in order that their families might eat. But not<br> the women of the Old Guard, and the women were the implacable and<br> inflexible power behind the social throne. The Lost Cause was<br> stronger, dearer now in their hearts than it had ever been at the<br> height of its glory. It was a fetish now. Everything about it was<br> sacred, the graves of the men who had died for it, the battle<br> fields, the torn flags, the crossed sabres in their halls, the<br> fading letters from the front, the veterans. These women gave no<br> aid, comfort or quarter to the late enemy, and now Scarlett was<br> numbered among the enemy.<br><br> In this mongrel society thrown together by the exigencies of the<br> political situation, there was but one thing in common. That was<br> money. As most of them had never had twenty-five dollars at one<br> time in their whole lives, previous to the war, they were now<br> embarked on an orgy of spending such as Atlanta had never seen<br> before.<br><br> With the Republicans in the political saddle the town entered into<br> an era of waste and ostentation, with the trappings of refinement<br> thinly veneering the vice and vulgarity beneath. Never before had<br> the cleavage of the very rich and the very poor been so marked.<br> Those on top took no thought for those less fortunate. Except for<br> the negroes, of course. They must have the very best. The best of<br> schools and lodgings and clothes and amusements, for they were the<br> power in politics and every negro vote counted. But as for the<br> recently impoverished Atlanta people, they could starve and drop in<br> the streets for all the newly rich Republicans cared.<br><br> On the crest of this wave of vulgarity, Scarlett rode triumphantly,<br> newly a bride, dashingly pretty in her fine clothes, with Rhett's<br> money solidly behind her. It was an era that suited her, crude,<br> garish, showy, full of over-dressed women, over-furnished houses,<br> too many jewels, too many horses, too much food, too much whisky.<br> When Scarlett infrequently stopped to think about the matter she<br> knew that none of her new associates could be called ladies by<br> Ellen's strict standards. But she had broken with Ellen's<br> standards too many times since that far-away day when she stood in<br> the parlor at Tara and decided to be Rhett's mistress, and she did<br> not often feel the bite of conscience now.<br><br> Perhaps these new friends were not, strictly speaking, ladies and<br> gentlemen but like Rhett's New Orleans friends, they were so much<br> fun! So very much more fun than the subdued, churchgoing,<br> Shakespeare-reading friends of her earlier Atlanta days. And,<br> except for her brief honeymoon interlude, she had not had fun in so<br> long. Nor had she had any sense of security. Now secure, she<br> wanted to dance, to play, to riot, to gorge on foods and fine wine,<br> to deck herself in silks and satins, to wallow on soft feather beds<br> and fine upholstery. And she did all these things. Encouraged by<br> Rhett's amused tolerance, freed now from the restraints of her<br> childhood, freed even from that last fear of poverty, she was<br> permitting herself the luxury she had often dreamed--of doing<br> exactly what she pleased and telling people who didn't like it to<br> go to hell.<br><br> To her had come that pleasant intoxication peculiar to those whose<br> lives are a deliberate slap in the face of organized society--the<br> gambler, the confidence man, the polite adventuress, all those who<br> succeed by their wits. She said and did exactly what she pleased<br> and, in practically no time, her insolence knew no bounds.<br><br> She did not hesitate to display arrogance to her new Republican and<br> Scallawag friends but to no class was she ruder or more insolent<br> than the Yankee officers of the garrison and their families. Of<br> all the heterogeneous mass of people who had poured into Atlanta,<br> the army people alone she refused to receive or tolerate. She even<br> went out of her way to be bad mannered to them. Melanie was not<br> alone in being unable to forget what a blue uniform meant. To<br> Scarlett, that uniform and those gold buttons would always mean the<br> fears of the siege, the terror of flight, the looting and burning,<br> the desperate poverty and the grinding work at Tara. Now that she<br> was rich and secure in the friendship of the governor and many<br> prominent Republicans, she could be insulting to every blue uniform<br> she saw. And she was insulting.<br><br> Rhett once lazily pointed out to her that most of the male guests<br> who assembled under their roof had worn that same blue uniform not<br> so long ago, but she retorted that a Yankee didn't seem like a<br> Yankee unless he had on a blue uniform. To which Rhett replied:<br> ‘Consistency, thou art a jewel,’ and shrugged.<br><br> Scarlett, hating the bright hard blue they wore, enjoyed snubbing<br> them all the more because it so bewildered them. The garrison<br> families had a right to be bewildered for most of them were quiet,<br> well-bred folk, lonely in a hostile land, anxious to go home to the<br> North, a little ashamed of the riffraff whose rule they were forced<br> to uphold--an infinitely better class than that of Scarlett's<br> associates. Naturally, the officers' wives were puzzled that the<br> dashing Mrs. Butler took to her bosom such women as the common red-<br> haired Bridget Flaherty and went out of her way to slight them.<br><br> But even the ladies whom Scarlett took to her bosom had to endure<br> much from her. However, they did it gladly. To them, she not only<br> represented wealth and elegance but the old regime, with its old<br> names, old families, old traditions with which they wished ardently<br> to identify themselves. The old families they yearned after might<br> have cast Scarlett out but the ladies of the new aristocracy did<br> not know it. They only knew that Scarlett's father had been a<br> great slave owner, her mother a Robillard of Savannah and her<br> husband was Rhett Butler of Charleston. And this was enough for<br> them. She was their opening wedge into the old society they wished<br> to enter, the society which scorned them, would not return calls<br> and bowed frigidly in churches. In fact, she was more than their<br> wedge into society. To them, fresh from obscure beginnings, she<br> WAS society. Pinchbeck ladies themselves, they no more saw through<br> Scarlett's pinchbeck pretensions than she herself did. They took<br> her at her own valuation and endured much at her hands, her airs,<br> her graces, her tempers, her arrogance, her downright rudeness and<br> her frankness about their shortcomings.<br><br> They were so lately come from nothing and so uncertain of themselves<br> they were doubly anxious to appear refined and feared to show their<br> temper or make retorts in kind, lest they be considered unladylike.<br> At all costs they must be ladies. They pretended to great delicacy,<br> modesty and innocence. To hear them talk one would have thought<br> they had no legs, natural functions or knowledge of the wicked<br> world. No one would have thought that red-haired Bridget Flaherty,<br> who had a sun-defying white skin and a brogue that could be cut with<br> a butter knife, had stolen her father's hidden hoard to come to<br> America to be chambermaid in a New York hotel. And to observe the<br> delicate vapors of Sylvia (formerly Sadie Belle) Connington and<br> Mamie Bart, no one would have suspected that the first grew up above<br> her father's saloon in the Bowery and waited on the bar at rush<br> times, and that the latter, so it was said, had come out of one of<br> her husband's own brothels. No, they were delicate sheltered<br> creatures now.<br><br> The men, though they had made money, learned new ways less easily<br> or were, perhaps, less patient with the demands of the new<br> gentility. They drank heavily at Scarlett's parties, far too<br> heavily, and usually after a reception there were one or more<br> unexpected guests who stayed the night. They did not drink like<br> the men of Scarlett's girlhood. They became sodden, stupid, ugly<br> or obscene. Moreover, no matter how many spittoons she might put<br> out in view, the rugs always showed signs of tobacco juice on the<br> mornings after.<br><br> She had a contempt for these people but she enjoyed them. Because<br> she enjoyed them, she filled the house with them. And because of<br> her contempt, she told them to go to hell as often as they annoyed<br> her. But they stood it.<br><br> They even stood Rhett, a more difficult matter, for Rhett saw<br> through them and they knew it. He had no hesitation about<br> stripping them verbally, even under his own roof, always in a<br> manner that left them no reply. Unashamed of how he came by his<br> fortune, he pretended that they, too, were unashamed of their<br> beginnings and he seldom missed an opportunity to remark upon<br> matters which, by common consent, everyone felt were better left in<br> polite obscurity.<br><br> There was never any knowing when he would remark affably, over a<br> punch cup: ‘Ralph, if I'd had any sense I'd have made my money<br> selling gold-mine stocks to widows and orphans, like you, instead<br> of blockading. It's so much safer.’ ‘Well, Bill, I see you have a<br> new span of horses. Been selling a few thousand more bonds for<br> nonexistent railroads? Good work, boy!’ ‘Congratulations, Amos,<br> on landing that state contract. Too bad you had to grease so many<br> palms to get it.’<br><br> The ladies felt that he was odiously, unendurably vulgar. The men<br> said, behind his back, that he was a swine and a bastard. New<br> Atlanta liked Rhett no better than old Atlanta had done and he made<br> as little attempt to conciliate the one as he had the other. He<br> went his way, amused, contemptuous, impervious to the opinions of<br> those about him, so courteous that his courtesy was an affront in<br> itself. To Scarlett, he was still an enigma but an enigma about<br> which she no longer bothered her head. She was convinced that<br> nothing ever pleased him or ever would please him, that he either<br> wanted something badly and didn't have it, or never had wanted<br> anything and so didn't care about anything. He laughed at<br> everything she did, encouraged her extravagances and insolences,<br> jeered at her pretenses--and paid the bills.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER L<br><br> <br> Rhett never deviated from his smooth, imperturbable manners, even<br> in their most intimate moments. But Scarlett never lost the old<br> feeling that he was watching her covertly, knew that if she turned<br> her head suddenly she would surprise in his eyes that speculative,<br> waiting look, that look of almost terrible patience that she did<br> not understand.<br><br> Sometimes, he was a very comfortable person to live with, for all<br> his unfortunate habit of not permitting anyone in his presence to<br> act a lie, palm off a pretense or indulge in bombast. He listened<br> to her talk of the store and the mills and the saloon, the convicts<br> and the cost of feeding them, and gave shrewd hard-headed advice.<br> He had untiring energy for the dancing and parties she loved and an<br> unending supply of coarse stories with which he regaled her on<br> their infrequent evenings alone when the table was cleared and<br> brandy and coffee before them. She found that he would give her<br> anything she desired, answer any question she asked as long as she<br> was forthright, and refuse her anything she attempted to gain by<br> indirection, hints and feminine angling. He had a disconcerting<br> habit of seeing through her and laughing rudely.<br><br> Contemplating the suave indifference with which he generally<br> treated her, Scarlett frequently wondered, but with no real<br> curiosity, why he had married her. Men married for love or a home<br> and children or money but she knew he had married her for none of<br> these things. He certainly did not love her. He referred to her<br> lovely house as an architectural horror and said he would rather<br> live in a well-regulated hotel than a home. And he never once<br> hinted about children as Charles and Frank had done. Once when<br> trying to coquet with him she asked why he married her and was<br> infuriated when he replied with an amused gleam in his eyes: ‘I<br> married you to keep you for a pet, my dear.’<br><br> No, he hadn't married her for any of the usual reasons men marry<br> women. He had married her solely because he wanted her and<br> couldn't get her any other way. He had admitted as much the night<br> he proposed to her. He had wanted her, just as he had wanted Belle<br> Watling. This was not a pleasant thought. In fact, it was a<br> barefaced insult. But she shrugged it off as she had learned to<br> shrug off all unpleasant facts. They had made a bargain and she<br> was quite pleased with her side of the bargain. She hoped he was<br> equally pleased but she did not care very much whether he was or<br> not.<br><br> But one afternoon when she was consulting Dr. Meade about a<br> digestive upset, she learned an unpleasant fact which she could not<br> shrug off. It was with real hate in her eyes that she stormed into<br> her bedroom at twilight and told Rhett that she was going to have a<br> baby.<br><br> He was lounging in a silk dressing gown in a cloud of smoke and his<br> eyes went sharply to her face as she spoke. But he said nothing.<br> He watched her in silence but there was a tenseness about his pose,<br> as he waited for her next words, that was lost on her. Indignation<br> and despair had claimed her to the exclusion of all other thoughts.<br><br> ‘You know I don't want any more children! I never wanted any at<br> all. Every time things are going right with me I have to have a<br> baby. Oh, don't sit there and laugh! You don't want it either.<br> Oh, Mother of God!’<br><br> If he was waiting for words from her, these were not the words he<br> wanted. His face hardened slightly and his eyes became blank.<br><br> ‘Well, why not give it to Miss Melly? Didn't you tell me she was<br> so misguided as to want another baby?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I could kill you! I won't have it, I tell you, I won't!’<br><br> ‘No? Pray continue.’<br><br> ‘Oh, there are things to do. I'm not the stupid country fool I<br> used to be. Now, I know that a woman doesn't have to have children<br> if she doesn't want them! There are things--’<br><br> He was on his feet and had her by the wrist and there was a hard,<br> driving fear in his face.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, you fool, tell me the truth! You haven't done anything?’<br><br> ‘No, I haven't, but I'm going to. Do you think I'm going to have<br> my figure ruined all over again, just when I've gotten my waist<br> line down and am having a good time.’<br><br> ‘Where did you get this idea? Who's been telling you things?’<br><br> ‘Mamie Bart--she--’<br><br> ‘The madam of a whore house would know such tricks. That woman<br> never puts foot in this house again, do you understand? After all,<br> it is my house and I'm the master of it. I do not even want you to<br> speak to her again.’<br><br> ‘I'll do as I please. Turn me loose. Why should you care?’<br><br> ‘I don't care whether you have one child or twenty, but I do care<br> if you die.’<br><br> ‘Die? Me?’<br><br> ‘Yes, die. I don't suppose Mamie Bart told you the chances a woman<br> takes when she does a thing like that?’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Scarlett reluctantly. ‘She just said it would fix<br> things up fine.’<br><br> ‘By God, I will kill her!’ cried Rhett and his face was black with<br> rage. He looked down into Scarlett's tear-stained face and some of<br> the wrath faded but it was still hard and set. Suddenly he picked<br> her up in his arms and sat down in the chair, holding her close to<br> him, tightly, as if he feared she would get away from him.<br><br> ‘Listen, my baby, I won't have you take your life in your hands.<br> Do you hear? Good God, I don't want children any more than you do,<br> but I can support them. I don't want to hear any more foolishness<br> out of you, and if you dare try to--Scarlett, I saw a girl die that<br> way once. She was only a--well, but she was a pretty sort at that.<br> It's not an easy way to die. I--’<br><br> ‘Why, Rhett!’ she cried, startled out of her misery at the emotion<br> in his voice. She had never seen him so moved. ‘Where--who--’<br><br> ‘In New Orleans--oh, years ago. I was young and impressionable.’<br> He bent his head suddenly and buried his lips in her hair. ‘You'll<br> have your baby, Scarlett, if I have to handcuff you to my wrist for<br> the next nine months.’<br><br> She sat up in his lap and stared into his face with frank curiosity.<br> Under her gaze it was suddenly smooth and bland as though wiped<br> clear by magic. His eyebrows were up and the corner of his mouth<br> was down.<br><br> ‘Do I mean so much to you?’ she questioned, dropping her eyelids.<br><br> He gave her a level look as though estimating how much coquetry was<br> behind the question. Reading the true meaning of her demeanor, he<br> made casual answer.<br><br> ‘Well, yes. You see, I've invested a good deal of money in you,<br> and I'd hate to lose it.’<br><br> <br> * * * * *<br><br> <br> Melanie came out of Scarlett's room, weary from the strain but<br> happy to tears at the birth of Scarlett's daughter. Rhett stood<br> tensely in the hall, surrounded by cigar butts which had burned<br> holes in the fine carpet.<br><br> ‘You can go in now, Captain Butler,’ she said shyly.<br><br> Rhett went swiftly past her into the room and Melanie had a brief<br> glimpse of him bending over the small naked baby in Mammy's lap<br> before Dr. Meade shut the door. Melanie sank into a chair, her<br> face pinkening with embarrassment that she had unintentionally<br> witnessed so intimate a scene.<br><br> ‘Ah!’ she thought. ‘How sweet! How worried poor Captain Butler<br> has been! And he did not take a single drink all this time! How<br> nice of him. So many gentlemen are so intoxicated by the time<br> their babies are born. I fear he needs a drink badly. Dare I<br> suggest it? No, that would be very forward of me.’<br><br> She sank gratefully into a chair, her back, which always ached<br> these days, feeling as though it would break in two at the waist<br> line. Oh, how fortunate Scarlett was to have Captain Butler just<br> outside her door while the baby was being born! If only she had<br> had Ashley with her that dreadful day Beau came she would not have<br> suffered half so much. If only that small girl behind those closed<br> doors were hers and not Scarlett's! Oh, how wicked I am, she<br> thought guiltily. I am coveting her baby and Scarlett has been so<br> good to me. Forgive me, Lord. I wouldn't really want Scarlett's<br> baby but--but I would so like a baby of my own!<br><br> She pushed a small cushion behind her aching back and thought<br> hungrily of a daughter of her own. But Dr. Meade had never changed<br> his opinion on that subject. And though she was quite willing to<br> risk her life for another child, Ashley would not hear of it. A<br> daughter. How Ashley would love a daughter!<br><br> A daughter! Mercy! She sat up in alarm. I never told Captain<br> Butler it was a girl! And of course he was expecting a boy. Oh,<br> how dreadful!<br><br> Melanie knew that to a woman a child of either sex was equally<br> welcome but to a man, and especially such a self-willed man as<br> Captain Butler, a girl would be a blow, a reflection upon his<br> manhood. Oh, how thankful she was that God had permitted her only<br> child to be a boy! She knew that, had she been the wife of the<br> fearsome Captain Butler, she would have thankfully died in<br> childbirth rather than present him with a daughter as his first-<br> born.<br><br> But Mammy, waddling grinning from the room, set her mind at ease--<br> and at the same time made her wonder just what kind of man Captain<br> Butler really was.<br><br> ‘W'en Ah wuz bathin' dat chile jes' now,’ said Mammy, ‘Ah kinder<br> 'pologized ter Mist' Rhett 'bout it not bein' a boy. But, Lawd,<br> Miss Melly, you know whut he say? He say, 'Hesh yo' mouf, Mammy!<br> Who want a boy? Boys ain' no fun. Dey's jes' a passel of trouble.<br> Gals is whut is fun. Ah wouldn' swap disyere gal fer a baker's<br> dozen of boys.' Den he try ter snatch de chile frum me, buck<br> nekked as she wuz an' Ah slap his wrist an' say 'B'have yo'seff,<br> Mist' Rhett! Ah'll jes' bide mah time tell you gits a boy, an' den<br> Ah'll laff out loud to hear you holler fer joy.' He grin an' shake<br> his haid an' say, 'Mammy, you is a fool. Boys ain' no use ter<br> nobody. Ain' Ah a proof of dat?' Yas'm, Miss Melly, he ack lak a<br> gempmum 'bout it,’ finished Mammy graciously. It was not lost on<br> Melanie that Rhett's conduct had gone far toward redeeming him in<br> Mammy's eyes. ‘Maybe Ah done been a mite wrong 'bout Mist' Rhett.<br> Dis sho is a happy day ter me, Miss Melly. Ah done diapered three<br> ginrations of Robillard gals, an' it sho is a happy day.’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, it is a happy day, Mammy. The happiest days are the days<br> when babies come!’<br><br> To one person in the house it was not a happy day. Scolded and for<br> the most part ignored, Wade Hampton idled miserably about the<br> dining room. Early that morning, Mammy had waked him abruptly,<br> dressed him hurriedly and sent him with Ella to Aunt Pitty's house<br> for breakfast. The only explanation he received was that his<br> mother was sick and the noise of his playing might upset her. Aunt<br> Pitty's house was in an uproar, for the news of Scarlett's sickness<br> had sent the old lady to bed in a state with Cookie in attendance,<br> and breakfast was a scant meal that Peter concocted for the<br> children. As the morning wore on fear began to possess Wade's<br> soul. Suppose Mother died? Other boys' mothers had died. He had<br> seen the hearses move away from the house and heard his small<br> friends sobbing. Suppose Mother should die? Wade loved his mother<br> very much, almost as much as he feared her, and the thought of her<br> being carried away in a black hearse behind black horses with<br> plumes on their bridles made his small chest ache so that he could<br> hardly breathe.<br><br> When noon came and Peter was busy in the kitchen, Wade slipped out<br> the front door and hurried home as fast as his short legs could<br> carry him, fear speeding him. Uncle Rhett or Aunt Melly or Mammy<br> surely would tell him the truth. But Uncle Rhett and Aunt Melly<br> were not to be seen and Mammy and Dilcey sped up and down the back<br> stairs with towels and basins of hot water and did not once notice<br> him in the front hall. From upstairs he could hear occasionally<br> the curt tones of Dr. Meade whenever a door opened. Once he heard<br> his mother groan and he burst into sobbing hiccoughs. He knew she<br> was going to die. For comfort, he made overtures to the honey-<br> colored cat which lay on the sunny window sill in the front hall.<br> But Tom, full of years and irritable at disturbances, switched his<br> tail and spat softly.<br><br> Finally, Mammy, coming down the front stairs, her apron rumpled and<br> spotted, her head rag awry, saw him and scowled. Mammy had always<br> been Wade's mainstay and her frown made him tremble.<br><br> ‘You is de wustes' boy Ah ever seed,’ she said. ‘Ain' Ah done sont<br> you ter Miss Pitty's? Gwan back dar!’<br><br> ‘Is Mother going to--will she die?’<br><br> ‘You is de troublesomes' chile Ah ever seed! Die? Gawdlmighty,<br> no! Lawd, boys is a tawment. Ah doan see why de Lawd sen's boys<br> ter folks. Now, gwan way from here.’<br><br> But Wade did not go. He retreated behind the portieres in the<br> hall, only half convinced by her words. The remark about the<br> troublesomeness of boys stung, for he had always tried his best to<br> be good. Aunt Melly hurried down the stairs half an hour later,<br> pale and tired but smiling to herself. She looked thunderstruck<br> when she saw his woebegone face in the shadows of the drapery.<br> Usually Aunt Melly had all the time in the world to give him. She<br> never said, as Mother so often did: ‘Don't bother me now. I'm in<br> a hurry’ or ‘Run away, Wade. I am busy.’<br><br> But this morning she said: ‘Wade, you've been very naughty. Why<br> didn't you stay at Aunt Pitty's?’<br><br> ‘Is Mother going to die?’<br><br> ‘Gracious, no, Wade! Don't be a silly child,’ and then, relenting:<br> ‘Dr. Meade has just brought her a nice little baby, a sweet little<br> sister for you to play with, and if you are real good you can see<br> her tonight. Now, run out and play and don't make any noise.’<br><br> Wade slipped into the quiet dining room, his small and insecure<br> world tottering. Was there no place for a worried little seven-<br> year-old boy on this sunshiny day when the grown-ups acted so<br> curiously? He sat down on the window still in the alcove and<br> nibbled a bit of the elephant's ear which grew in a box in the sun.<br> It was so peppery that it stung his eyes to tears and he began to<br> cry. Mother was probably dying, nobody paid him any heed and one<br> and all, they rushed about because of a new baby--a girl baby.<br> Wade had little interest in babies, still less in girls. The only<br> little girl he knew intimately was Ella and, so far, she had done<br> nothing to command his respect or liking.<br><br> After a long interval Dr. Meade and Uncle Rhett came down the<br> stairs and stood talking in the hall in low voices. After the door<br> shut behind the doctor, Uncle Rhett came swiftly into the dining<br> room and poured himself a large drink from the decanter before he<br> saw Wade. Wade shrank back, expecting to be told again that he was<br> naughty and must return to Aunt Pitty's, but instead, Uncle Rhett<br> smiled. Wade had never seen him smile like that or look so happy<br> and, encouraged, he leaped from the sill and ran to him.<br><br> ‘You've got a sister,’ said Rhett, squeezing him. ‘By God, the<br> most beautiful baby you ever saw! Now, why are you crying?’<br><br> ‘Mother--’<br><br> ‘Your mother's eating a great big dinner, chicken and rice and<br> gravy and coffee, and we're going to make her some ice cream in a<br> little while and you can have two plates if you want them. And<br> I'll show you your sister too.’<br><br> Weak with relief, Wade tried to be polite about his new sister but<br> failed. Everyone was interested in this girl. No one cared<br> anything about him any more, not even Aunt Melly or Uncle Rhett.<br><br> ‘Uncle Rhett,’ he began, ‘do people like girls better than boys?’<br><br> Rhett set down his glass and looked sharply into the small face and<br> instant comprehension came into his eyes.<br><br> ‘No, I can't say they do,’ he answered seriously, as though giving<br> the matter due thought. ‘It's just that girls are more trouble<br> than boys and people are apt to worry more about troublesome people<br> than those who aren't.’<br><br> ‘Mammy just said boys were troublesome.’<br><br> ‘Well, Mammy was upset. She didn't mean it.’<br><br> ‘Uncle Rhett, wouldn't you rather have had a little boy than a<br> little girl?’ questioned Wade hopefully.<br><br> ‘No,’ answered Rhett swiftly and, seeing the boy's face fall, he<br> continued: ‘Now, why should I want a boy when I've already got<br> one?’<br><br> ‘You have?’ cried Wade, his mouth falling open at this information.<br> ‘Where is he?’<br><br> ‘Right here,’ answered Rhett and, picking the child up, drew him to<br> his knee. ‘You are boy enough for me, son.’<br><br> For a moment, the security and happiness of being wanted was so<br> great that Wade almost cried again. His throat worked and he<br> ducked his head against Rhett's waistcoat.<br><br> ‘You are my boy, aren't you?’<br><br> ‘Can you be--well, two men's boy?’ questioned Wade, loyalty to the<br> father he had never known struggling with love for the man who held<br> him so understandingly.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said Rhett firmly. ‘Just like you can be your mother's boy<br> and Aunt Melly's, too.’<br><br> Wade digested this statement. It made sense to him and he smiled<br> and wriggled against Rhett's arm shyly.<br><br> ‘You understand little boys, don't you, Uncle Rhett?’<br><br> Rhett's dark face fell into its old harsh lines and his lip<br> twisted.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ he said bitterly, ‘I understand little boys.’<br><br> For a moment, fear came back to Wade, fear and a sudden sense of<br> jealousy. Uncle Rhett was not thinking of him but of some one<br> else.<br><br> ‘You haven't got any other little boys have you?’<br><br> Rhett set him on his feet.<br><br> ‘I'm going to have a drink and so are you, Wade, your first drink,<br> a toast to your new sister.’<br><br> ‘You haven't got any other--’ began Wade and then seeing Rhett<br> reach for the decanter of claret, the excitement at being included<br> in this grown-up ceremony diverted him.<br><br> ‘Oh, I can't, Uncle Rhett! I promised Aunt Melly I wouldn't drink<br> till I graduated from the university and she's going to give me a<br> watch, if I don't.’<br><br> ‘And I'll give you a chain for it--this one I'm wearing now, if you<br> want it,’ said Rhett and he was smiling again. ‘Aunt Melly's quite<br> right. But she was talking about spirits, not wine. You must<br> learn to drink wine like a gentleman, son, and there's no time like<br> the present to learn.’<br><br> Skillfully, he diluted the claret with water from the carafe until<br> the liquid was barely pink and handed the glass to Wade. At that<br> moment, Mammy entered the dining room. She had changed to her best<br> Sunday black and her apron and head rag were fresh and crisp. As<br> she waddled, she switched herself and from her skirts came the<br> whisper and rustle of silk. The worried look had gone from her<br> face and her almost toothless gums showed in a wide smile.<br><br> ‘Burfday gif', Mist' Rhett!’ she said.<br><br> Wade stopped with his glass at his lips. He knew Mammy had never<br> liked his stepfather. He had never heard her call him anything<br> except ‘Cap'n Butler,’ and her conduct toward him had been<br> dignified but cold. And here she was beaming and sidling and<br> calling him ‘Mist' Rhett!’ What a topsy-turvy day!<br><br> ‘You'd rather have rum than claret, I suppose,’ said Rhett, reaching<br> into the cellaret and producing a squat bottle. ‘She is a beautiful<br> baby, isn't she, Mammy?’<br><br> ‘She sho is,’ answered Mammy, smacking her lips as she took the<br> glass.<br><br> ‘Did you ever see a prettier one?’<br><br> ‘Well, suh, Miss Scarlett wuz mout nigh as pretty w'en she come but<br> not quite.’<br><br> ‘Have another glass, Mammy. And Mammy,’ his tone was stern but his<br> eyes twinkled, ‘what's that rustling noise I hear?’<br><br> ‘Lawd, Mist' Rhett, dat ain' nuthin' but mah red silk petticoat!’<br> Mammy giggled and switched till her huge bulk shook.<br><br> ‘Nothing but your petticoat! I don't believe it. You sound like a<br> peck of dried leaves rubbing together. Let me see. Pull up your<br> skirt.’<br><br> ‘Mist' Rhett, you is bad! Yeah-O, Lawd!’<br><br> Mammy gave a little shriek and retreated and from a distance of a<br> yard, modestly elevated her dress a few inches and showed the<br> ruffle of a red taffeta petticoat.<br><br> ‘You took long enough about wearing it,’ grumbled Rhett but his<br> black eyes laughed and danced.<br><br> ‘Yassuh, too long.’<br><br> Then Rhett said something that Wade did not understand.<br><br> ‘No more mule in horse harness?’<br><br> ‘Mist' Rhett, Miss Scarlett wuz bad ter tell you dat! You ain'<br> holin' dat again' dis ole nigger?’<br><br> ‘No. I'm not holding it. I just wanted to know. Have another<br> drink, Mammy. Have the whole bottle. Drink up, Wade! Give us a<br> toast.’<br><br> ‘To Sissy,’ cried Wade and gulped the liquid down. Choking he<br> began to cough and hiccough and the other two laughed and beat him<br> on the back.<br><br> <br><br> From the moment his daughter was born, Rhett's conduct was puzzling<br> to all observers and he upset many settled notions about himself,<br> notions which both the town and Scarlett were loath to surrender.<br> Whoever would have thought that he of all people would be so<br> shamelessly, so openly proud of fatherhood? Especially in view of<br> the embarrassing circumstance that his first-born was a girl and<br> not a boy.<br><br> The novelty of fatherhood did not wear off. This caused some<br> secret envy among women whose husbands took offspring for granted,<br> long before the children were christened. He buttonholed people on<br> the street and related details of his child's miraculous progress<br> without even prefacing his remarks with the hypocritical but<br> polite: ‘I know everyone thinks their own child is smart but--’<br> He thought his daughter marvelous, not to be compared with lesser<br> brats, and he did not care who knew it. When the new nurse<br> permitted the baby to suck a bit of fat pork, thereby bringing on<br> the first attack of colic, Rhett's conduct sent seasoned fathers<br> and mothers into gales of laughter. He hurriedly summoned Dr.<br> Meade and two other doctors, and with difficulty he was restrained<br> from beating the unfortunate nurse with his crop. The nurse was<br> discharged and thereafter followed a series of nurses who remained,<br> at the most, a week. None of them was good enough to satisfy the<br> exacting requirements Rhett laid down.<br><br> Mammy likewise viewed with displeasure the nurses that came and<br> went, for she was jealous of any strange negro and saw no reason<br> why she could not care for the baby and Wade and Ella, too. But<br> Mammy was showing her age and rheumatism was slowing her lumbering<br> tread. Rhett lacked the courage to cite these reasons for<br> employing another nurse. He told her instead that a man of his<br> position could not afford to have only one nurse. It did not look<br> well. He would hire two others to do the drudgery and leave her as<br> Mammy-in-chief. This Mammy understood very well. More servants<br> were a credit to her position as well as Rhett's. But she would<br> not, she told him firmly, have any trashy free issue niggers in<br> her nursery. So Rhett sent to Tara for Prissy. He knew her<br> shortcomings but, after all, she was a family darky. And Uncle<br> Peter produced a great-niece named Lou who had belonged to one of<br> Miss Pitty's Burr cousins.<br><br> Even before Scarlett was able to be about again, she noticed<br> Rhett's pre-occupation with the baby and was somewhat nettled and<br> embarrassed at his pride in her in front of callers. It was all<br> very well for a man to love his child but she felt there was<br> something unmanly in the display of such love. He should be<br> offhand and careless, as other men were.<br><br> ‘You are making a fool of yourself,’ she said irritably, ‘and I<br> don't see why.’<br><br> ‘No? Well, you wouldn't. The reason is that she's the first<br> person who's ever belonged utterly to me.’<br><br> ‘She belongs to me, too!’<br><br> ‘No, you have two other children. She's mine.’<br><br> ‘Great balls of fire!’ said Scarlett. ‘I had the baby, didn't I?<br> Besides, honey, I belong to you.’<br><br> Rhett looked at her over the black head of the child and smiled<br> oddly.<br><br> ‘Do you, my dear?’<br><br> Only the entrance of Melanie stopped one of those swift hot<br> quarrels which seemed to spring up so easily between them these<br> days. Scarlett swallowed her wrath and watched Melanie take the<br> baby. The name agreed upon for the child was Eugenie Victoria, but<br> that afternoon Melanie unwittingly bestowed a name that clung, even<br> as ‘Pittypat’ had blotted out all memory of Sarah Jane.<br><br> Rhett leaning over the child had said: ‘Her eyes are going to be<br> pea green.’<br><br> ‘Indeed they are not,’ cried Melanie indignantly, forgetting that<br> Scarlett's eyes were almost that shade. ‘They are going to be<br> blue, like Mr. O'Hara's eyes, as blue as--as blue as the bonnie<br> blue flag.’<br><br> ‘Bonnie Blue Butler,’ laughed Rhett, taking the child from her and<br> peering more closely into the small eyes. And Bonnie she became<br> until even her parents did not recall that she had been named for<br> two queens.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LI<br><br> <br> When she was finally able to go out again, Scarlett had Lou lace<br> her into stays as tightly as the strings would pull. Then she<br> passed the tape measure about her waist. Twenty inches! She<br> groaned aloud. That was what having babies did to your figure!<br> Her waist was a large as Aunt Pitty's, as large as Mammy's.<br><br> ‘Pull them tighter, Lou. See if you can't make it eighteen and a<br> half inches or I can't get into any of my dresses.’<br><br> ‘It'll bust de strings,’ said Lou. ‘Yo' wais' jes' done got<br> bigger, Miss Scarlett, an' dar ain' nuthin' ter do 'bout it.’<br><br> ‘There is something to do about it,’ thought Scarlett as she ripped<br> savagely at the seams of her dress to let out the necessary inches.<br> ‘I just won't have any more babies.’<br><br> Of course, Bonnie was pretty and a credit to her and Rhett adored<br> the child, but she would not have another baby. Just how she would<br> manage this she did not know, for she couldn't handle Rhett as she<br> had Frank. Rhett wasn't afraid of her. It would probably be<br> difficult with Rhett acting so foolishly about Bonnie and probably<br> wanting a son next year, for all that he said he'd drown any boy<br> she gave him. Well, she wouldn't give him a boy or girl either.<br> Three children were enough for any woman to have.<br><br> When Lou had stitched up the ripped seams, pressed them smooth and<br> buttoned Scarlett into the dress, she called the carriage and<br> Scarlett set out for the lumber yard. Her spirits rose as she went<br> and she forgot about her waist line, for she was going to meet<br> Ashley at the yard to go over the books with him. And, if she was<br> lucky, she might see him alone. She hadn't seen him since long<br> before Bonnie was born. She hadn't wanted to see him at all when<br> she was so obviously pregnant. And she had missed the daily<br> contact with him, even if there was always someone around. She had<br> missed the importance and activity of her lumber business while she<br> was immured. Of course, she did not have to work now. She could<br> easily sell the mills and invest the money for Wade and Ella. But<br> that would mean she would hardly ever see Ashley, except in a<br> formal social way with crowds of people around. And working by<br> Ashley's side was her greatest pleasure.<br><br> When she drove up to the yard she saw with interest how high the<br> piles of lumber were and how many customers were standing among<br> them, talking to Hugh Elsing. And there were six mule teams and<br> wagons being loaded by the negro drivers. Six teams, she thought,<br> with pride. And I did all this by myself!<br><br> Ashley came to the door of the little office, his eyes joyful with<br> the pleasure of seeing her again and he handed her out of her<br> carriage and into the office as if she were a queen.<br><br> But some of her pleasure was dimmed when she went over the books of<br> his mill and compared them with Johnnie Gallegher's books. Ashley<br> had barely made expenses and Johnnie had a remarkable sum to his<br> credit. She forbore to say anything as she looked at the two<br> sheets but Ashley read her face.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, I'm sorry. All I can say is that I wish you'd let me<br> hire free darkies instead of using convicts. I believe I could do<br> better.’<br><br> ‘Darkies! Why, their pay would break us. Convicts are dirt cheap.<br> If Johnnie can make this much with them--’<br><br> Ashley's eyes went over her shoulder, looking at something she<br> could not see, and the glad light went out of his eyes.<br><br> ‘I can't work convicts like Johnnie Gallegher. I can't drive men.’<br><br> ‘God's nightgown! Johnnie's a wonder at it. Ashley, you are just<br> too soft hearted. You ought to get more work out of them. Johnnie<br> told me that any time a malingerer wanted to get out of work he<br> told you he was sick and you gave him a day off. Good Lord,<br> Ashley! That's no way to make money. A couple of licks will cure<br> most any sickness short of a broken leg--’<br><br> ‘Scarlett! Scarlett! Stop! I can't bear to hear you talk that<br> way,’ cried Ashley, his eyes coming back to her with a fierceness<br> that stopped her short. ‘Don't you realize that they are men--some<br> of them sick, underfed, miserable and-- Oh, my dear, I can't bear<br> to see the way he has brutalized you, you who were always so sweet--’<br><br> ‘Who has whatted me?’<br><br> ‘I've got to say it and I haven't any right. But I've got to say<br> it. Your--Rhett Butler. Everything he touches he poisons. And he<br> has taken you who were so sweet and generous and gentle, for all<br> your spirited ways, and he has done this to you--hardened you,<br> brutalized you by his contact.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ breathed Scarlett, guilt struggling with joy that Ashley<br> should feel so deeply about her, should still think her sweet.<br> Thank God, he thought Rhett to blame for her penny-pinching ways.<br> Of course, Rhett had nothing to do with it and the guilt was hers<br> but, after all, another black mark on Rhett could do him no harm.<br><br> ‘If it were any other man in the world, I wouldn't care so much--<br> but Rhett Butler! I've seen what he's done to you. Without your<br> realizing it, he's twisted your thoughts into the same hard path<br> his own run in. Oh, yes, I know I shouldn't say this-- He saved<br> my life and I am grateful but I wish to God it had been any other<br> man but him! And I haven't the right to talk to you like--’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, you have the right--no, one else has!’<br><br> ‘I tell you I can't bear it, seeing your fineness coarsened by him,<br> knowing that your beauty and your charm are in the keeping of a man<br> who-- When I think of him touching you, I--’<br><br> ‘He's going to kiss me!’ thought Scarlett ecstatically. ‘And it<br> won't be my fault!’ She swayed toward him. But he drew back<br> suddenly, as if realizing he had said too much--said things he<br> never intended to say.<br><br> ‘I apologize most humbly, Scarlett. I--I've been insinuating that<br> your husband is not a gentleman and my own words have proved that<br> I'm not one. No one has a right to criticize a husband to a wife.<br> I haven't any excuse except--except--’ He faltered and his face<br> twisted. She waited breathless.<br><br> ‘I haven't any excuse at all.’<br><br> All the way home in the carriage Scarlett's mind raced. No excuse<br> at all except--except that he loved her! And the thought of her<br> lying in Rhett's arms roused a fury in him that she did not think<br> possible. Well, she could understand that. If it wasn't for the<br> knowledge that his relations with Melanie were, necessarily, those<br> of brother and sister, her own life would be a torment. And<br> Rhett's embraces coarsened her, brutalized her! Well, if Ashley<br> thought that, she could do very well without those embraces. She<br> thought how sweet and romantic it would be for them both to be<br> physically true to each other, even though married to other people.<br> The idea possessed her imagination and she took pleasure in it.<br> And then, too, there was the practical side of it. It would mean<br> that she would not have to have any more children.<br><br> When she reached home and dismissed the carriage, some of the<br> exaltation which had filled her at Ashley's words began to fade as<br> she faced the prospect of telling Rhett that she wanted separate<br> bedrooms and all which that implied. It would be difficult.<br> Moreover, how could she tell Ashley that she had denied herself to<br> Rhett, because of his wishes? What earthly good was a sacrifice if<br> no one knew about it? What a burden modesty and delicacy were! If<br> she could only talk to Ashley as frankly as she could to Rhett!<br> Well, no matter. She'd insinuate the truth to Ashley somehow.<br><br> She went up the stairs and, opening the nursery door, found Rhett<br> sitting beside Bonnie's crib with Ella upon his lap and Wade<br> displaying the contents of his pocket to him. What a blessing<br> Rhett liked children and made much of them! Some stepfathers were<br> so bitter about children of former marriages.<br><br> ‘I want to talk to you,’ she said and passed on into their bedroom.<br> Better have this over now while her determination not to have any<br> more children was hot within her and while Ashley's love was giving<br> her strength.<br><br> ‘Rhett,’ she said abruptly when he had closed the bedroom door<br> behind him, ‘I've decided that I don't want any more children.’<br><br> If he was startled at her unexpected statement he did not show it.<br> He lounged to a chair and sitting down, tilted it back.<br><br> ‘My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born, it is immaterial to<br> me whether you have one child or twenty.’<br><br> How perverse of him to evade the issue so neatly, as if not caring<br> whether children came had anything to do with their actual arrival.<br><br> ‘I think three are enough. I don't intend to have one every year.’<br><br> ‘Three seems an adequate number.’<br><br> ‘You know very well--’ she began, embarrassment making her cheeks<br> red. ‘You know what I mean?’<br><br> ‘I do. Do you realize that I can divorce you for refusing me my<br> marital rights?’<br><br> ‘You are just low enough to think of something like that,’ she<br> cried, annoyed that nothing was going as she planned it. ‘If you<br> had any chivalry you'd--you'd be nice like-- Well, look at Ashley<br> Wilkes. Melanie can't have any children and he--’<br><br> ‘Quite the little gentleman, Ashley,’ said Rhett and his eyes began<br> to gleam oddly. ‘Pray go on with your discourse.’<br><br> Scarlett choked, for her discourse was at its end and she had<br> nothing more to say. Now she saw how foolish had been her hope of<br> amicably settling so important a matter, especially with a selfish<br> swine like Rhett.<br><br> ‘You've been to the lumber office this afternoon, haven't you?’<br><br> ‘What has that to do with it?’<br><br> ‘You like dogs, don't you, Scarlett? Do you prefer them in kennels<br> or mangers?’<br><br> The allusion was lost on her as the tide of her anger and<br> disappointment rose.<br><br> He got lightly to his feet and coming to her put his hand under her<br> chin and jerked her face up to his.<br><br> ‘What a child you are! You have lived with three men and still<br> know nothing of men's natures. You seem to think they are like old<br> ladies past the change of life.’<br><br> He pinched her chin playfully and his hand dropped away from her.<br> One black eyebrow went up as he bent a cool long look on her.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, understand this. If you and your bed still held any<br> charms for me, no looks and no entreaties could keep me away. And<br> I would have no sense of shame for anything I did, for I made a<br> bargain with you--a bargain which I have kept and you are now<br> breaking. Keep your chaste bed, my dear.’<br><br> ‘Do you mean to tell me,’ cried Scarlett indignantly, ‘that you<br> don't care--’<br><br> ‘You have tired of me, haven't you? Well, men tire more easily<br> than women. Keep your sanctity, Scarlett. It will work no<br> hardship on me. It doesn't matter,’ he shrugged and grinned.<br> ‘Fortunately the world is full of beds--and most of the beds are<br> full of women.’<br><br> ‘You mean you'd actually be so--’<br><br> ‘My dear innocent! But, of course. It's a wonder I haven't<br> strayed long ere this. I never held fidelity to be a Virtue.’<br><br> ‘I shall lock my door every night!’<br><br> ‘Why bother? If I wanted you, no lock would keep me out.’<br><br> He turned, as though the subject were closed, and left the room.<br> Scarlett heard him going back to the nursery where he was welcomed<br> by the children. She sat down abruptly. She had had her way.<br> This was what she wanted and Ashley wanted. But it was not making<br> her happy. Her vanity was sore and she was mortified at the<br> thought that Rhett had taken it all so lightly, that he didn't want<br> her, that he put her on the level of other women in other beds.<br><br> She wished she could think of some delicate way to tell Ashley that<br> she and Rhett were no longer actually man and wife. But she knew<br> now she could not. It all seemed a terrible mess now and she half<br> heartedly wished she had said nothing about it. She would miss the<br> long amusing conversations in bed with Rhett when the ember of his<br> cigar glowed in the dark. She would miss the comfort of his arms<br> when she woke terrified from the dreams that she was running<br> through cold mist.<br><br> Suddenly she felt very unhappy and leaning her head on the arm of<br> the chair, she cried.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LII<br><br> <br> One rainy afternoon when Bonnie was barely past her first birthday,<br> Wade moped about the sitting room, occasionally going to the window<br> and flattening his nose on the dripping pane. He was a slender,<br> weedy boy, small for his eight years, quiet almost to shyness,<br> never speaking unless spoken to. He was bored and obviously at<br> loss for entertainment, for Ella was busy in the corner with her<br> dolls, Scarlett was at her secretary muttering to herself as she<br> added a long column of figures, and Rhett was lying on the floor,<br> swinging his watch by its chain, just out of Bonnie's reach.<br><br> After Wade had picked up several books and let them drop with bangs<br> and sighed deeply, Scarlett turned to him in irritation.<br><br> ‘Heavens, Wade! Run out and play.’<br><br> ‘I can't. It's raining.’<br><br> ‘Is it? I hadn't noticed. Well, do something. You make me<br> nervous, fidgeting about. Go tell Pork to hitch up the carriage<br> and take you over to play with Beau.’<br><br> ‘He isn't home,’ sighed Wade. ‘He's at Raoul Picard's birthday<br> party.’<br><br> Raoul was the small son of Maybelle and Rene Picard--a detestable<br> little brat, Scarlett thought, more like an ape than a child.<br><br> ‘Well, you can go to see anyone you want to. Run tell Pork.’<br><br> ‘Nobody's at home,’ answered Wade. ‘Everybody's at the party.’<br><br> The unspoken words ‘everybody--but me’ hung in the air; but<br> Scarlett, her mind on her account books, paid no heed.<br><br> Rhett raised himself to a sitting posture and said: ‘Why aren't<br> you at the party too, son?’<br><br> Wade edged closer to him, scuffing one foot and looking unhappy.<br><br> ‘I wasn't invited, sir.’<br><br> Rhett handed his watch into Bonnie's destructive grasp and rose<br> lightly to his feet.<br><br> ‘Leave those damned figures alone, Scarlett. Why wasn't Wade<br> invited to this party?’<br><br> ‘For Heaven's sake, Rhett! Don't bother me now. Ashley has gotten<br> these accounts in an awful snarl-- Oh, that party? Well, I think<br> it's nothing unusual that Wade wasn't invited and I wouldn't let<br> him go if he had been. Don't forget that Raoul is Mrs. Merriwether's<br> grandchild and Mrs. Merriwether would as soon have a free issue<br> nigger in her sacred parlor as one of us.’<br><br> Rhett, watching Wade's face with meditative eyes, saw the boy<br> flinch.<br><br> ‘Come here, son,’ he said, drawing the boy to him. ‘Would you like<br> to be at that party?’<br><br> ‘No, sir,’ said Wade bravely but his eyes fell.<br><br> ‘Hum. Tell me, Wade, do you go to little Joe Whiting's parties or<br> Frank Bonnell's or--well, any of your playmates?’<br><br> ‘No, sir. I don't get invited to many parties.’<br><br> ‘Wade, you are lying!’ cried Scarlett, turning. ‘You went to three<br> last week, the Bart children's party and the Gelerts' and the<br> Hundons'.’<br><br> ‘As choice a collection of mules in horse harness as you could<br> group together,’ said Rhett, his voice going into a soft drawl.<br> ‘Did you have a good time at those parties? Speak up.’<br><br> ‘No, sir.’<br><br> ‘Why not?’<br><br> ‘I--I dunno, sir. Mammy--Mammy says they're white trash.’<br><br> ‘I'll skin Mammy this minute!’ cried Scarlett, leaping to her feet.<br> ‘And as for you, Wade, talking so about Mother's friends--’<br><br> ‘The boy's telling the truth and so is Mammy,’ said Rhett. ‘But,<br> of course, you've never been able to know the truth if you met it<br> in the road. . . . Don't bother, son. You don't have to go to any<br> more parties you don't want to go to. Here,’ he pulled a bill from<br> his pocket, ‘tell Pork to harness the carriage and take you<br> downtown. Buy yourself some candy--a lot, enough to give you a<br> wonderful stomach ache.’<br><br> Wade, beaming, pocketed the bill and looked anxiously toward his<br> mother for confirmation. But she, with a pucker in her brows, was<br> watching Rhett. He had picked Bonnie from the floor and was<br> cradling her to him, her small face against his cheek. She could<br> not read his face but there was something in his eyes almost like<br> fear--fear and self-accusation.<br><br> Wade, encouraged by his stepfather's generosity, came shyly toward<br> him.<br><br> ‘Uncle Rhett, can I ask you sumpin'?’<br><br> ‘Of course.’ Rhett's look was anxious, absent, as he held Bonnie's<br> head closer. ‘What is it, Wade?’<br><br> ‘Uncle Rhett, were you--did you fight in the war?’<br><br> Rhett's eyes came alertly back and they were sharp, but his voice<br> was casual.<br><br> ‘Why do you ask, son?’<br><br> ‘Well, Joe Whiting said you didn't and so did Frankie Bonnell.’<br><br> ‘Ah,’ said Rhett, ‘and what did you tell them?’<br><br> Wade looked unhappy.<br><br> ‘I--I said--I told them I didn't know.’ And with a rush, ‘But I<br> didn't care and I hit them. Were you in the war, Uncle Rhett?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said Rhett, suddenly violent. ‘I was in the war. I was in<br> the army for eight months. I fought all the way from Lovejoy up to<br> Franklin, Tennessee. And I was with Johnston when he surrendered.’<br><br> Wade wriggled with pride but Scarlett laughed.<br><br> ‘I thought you were ashamed of your war record,’ she said. ‘Didn't<br> you tell me to keep it quiet?’<br><br> ‘Hush,’ he said briefly. ‘Does that satisfy you, Wade?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, sir! I knew you were in the war. I knew you weren't<br> scared like they said. But--why weren't you with the other little<br> boys' fathers?’<br><br> ‘Because the other little boys' fathers were such fools they had to<br> put them in the infantry. I was a West Pointer and so I was in the<br> artillery. In the regular artillery, Wade, not the Home Guard. It<br> takes a pile of sense to be in the artillery, Wade.’<br><br> ‘I bet,’ said Wade, his face shining. ‘Did you get wounded, Uncle<br> Rhett?’<br><br> Rhett hesitated.<br><br> ‘Tell him about your dysentery,’ jeered Scarlett.<br><br> Rhett carefully set the baby on the floor and pulled his shirt and<br> undershirt out of his trouser band.<br><br> ‘Come here, Wade, and I'll show you where I was wounded.’<br><br> Wade advanced, excited, and gazed where Rhett's finger pointed. A<br> long raised scar ran across his brown chest and down into his<br> heavily muscled abdomen. It was the souvenir of a knife fight in<br> the California gold fields but Wade did not know it. He breathed<br> heavily and happily.<br><br> ‘I guess you're 'bout as brave as my father, Uncle Rhett.’<br><br> ‘Almost but not quite,’ said Rhett, stuffing his shirt into his<br> trousers. ‘Now, go on and spend your dollar and whale hell out of<br> any boy who says I wasn't in the army.’<br><br> Wade went dancing out happily, calling to Pork, and Rhett picked up<br> the baby again.<br><br> ‘Now why all these lies, my gallant soldier laddie?’ asked<br> Scarlett.<br><br> ‘A boy has to be proud of his father--or stepfather. I can't let<br> him be ashamed before the other little brutes. Cruel creatures,<br> children.’<br><br> ‘Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!’<br><br> ‘I never thought about what it meant to Wade,’ said Rhett slowly.<br> ‘I never thought how he's suffered. And it's not going to be that<br> way for Bonnie.’<br><br> ‘What way?’<br><br> ‘Do you think I'm going to have my Bonnie ashamed of her father?<br> Have her left out of parties when she's nine or ten? Do you think<br> I'm going to have her humiliated like Wade for things that aren't<br> her fault but yours and mine?’<br><br> ‘Oh, children's parties!’<br><br> ‘Out of children's parties grow young girls' debut parties. Do you<br> think I'm going to let my daughter grow up outside of everything<br> decent in Atlanta? I'm not going to send her North to school and<br> to visit because she won't be accepted here or in Charleston or<br> Savannah or New Orleans. And I'm not going to see her forced to<br> marry a Yankee or a foreigner because no decent Southern family<br> will have her--because her mother was a fool and her father a<br> blackguard.’<br><br> Wade, who had come back to the door, was an interested but puzzled<br> listener.<br><br> ‘Bonnie can marry Beau, Uncle Rhett.’<br><br> The anger went from Rhett's face as he turned to the little boy,<br> and he considered his words with apparent seriousness as he always<br> did when dealing with the children.<br><br> ‘That's true, Wade. Bonnie can marry Beau Wilkes, but who will you<br> marry?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I shan't marry anyone,’ said Wade confidently, luxuriating in<br> a man-to-man talk with the one person, except Aunt Melly, who never<br> reproved and always encouraged him. ‘I'm going to go to Harvard<br> and be a lawyer, like my father, and then I'm going to be a brave<br> soldier just like him.’<br><br> ‘I wish Melly would keep her mouth shut,’ cried Scarlett. ‘Wade,<br> you are not going to Harvard. It's a Yankee school and I won't<br> have you going to a Yankee school. You are going to the University<br> of Georgia and after you graduate you are going to manage the store<br> for me. And as for your father being a brave soldier--’<br><br> ‘Hush,’ said Rhett curtly, not missing the shining light in Wade's<br> eyes when he spoke of the father he had never known. ‘You grow up<br> and be a brave man like your father, Wade. Try to be just like<br> him, for he was a hero and don't let anyone tell you differently.<br> He married your mother, didn't he? Well, that's proof enough of<br> heroism. And I'll see that you go to Harvard and become a lawyer.<br> Now, run along and tell Pork to take you to town.’<br><br> ‘I'll thank you to let me manage my children,’ cried Scarlett as<br> Wade obediently trotted from the room.<br><br> ‘You're a damned poor manager. You've wrecked whatever chances<br> Ella and Wade had, but I won't permit you to do Bonnie that way.<br> Bonnie's going to be a little princess and everyone in the world is<br> going to want her. There's not going to be any place she can't go.<br> Good God, do you think I'm going to let her grow up and associate<br> with the riffraff that fills this house?’<br><br> ‘They are good enough for you--’<br><br> ‘And a damned sight too good for you, my pet. But not for Bonnie.<br> Do you think I'd let her marry any of this runagate gang you spend<br> your time with? Irishmen on the make, Yankees, white trash,<br> Carpetbag parvenus-- My Bonnie with her Butler blood and her<br> Robillard strain--’<br><br> ‘The O'Haras--’<br><br> ‘The O'Haras might have been kings of Ireland once but your father<br> was nothing but a smart Mick on the make. And you are no better--<br> But then, I'm at fault too. I've gone through life like a bat out<br> of hell, never caring what I did, because nothing ever mattered to<br> me. But Bonnie matters. God, what a fool I've been! Bonnie<br> wouldn't be received in Charleston, no matter what my mother or<br> your Aunt Eulalie or Aunt Pauline did--and it's obvious that she<br> won't be received here unless we do something quickly--’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, you take it so seriously you're funny. With our money--’<br><br> ‘Damn our money! All our money can't buy what I want for her. I'd<br> rather Bonnie was invited to eat dry bread in the Picards'<br> miserable house or Mrs. Elsing's rickety barn than to be the belle<br> of a Republican inaugural ball. Scarlett, you've been a fool. You<br> should have insured a place for your children in the social scheme<br> years ago--but you didn't. You didn't even bother to keep what<br> position you had. And it's too much to hope that you'll mend your<br> ways at this late date. You're too anxious to make money and too<br> fond of bullying people.’<br><br> ‘I consider this whole affair a tempest in a teapot,’ said Scarlett<br> coldly, rattling her papers to indicate that as far as she was<br> concerned the discussion was finished.<br><br> ‘We have only Mrs. Wilkes to help us and you do your best to<br> alienate and insult her. Oh, spare me your remarks about her<br> poverty and her tacky clothes. She's the soul and the center of<br> everything in Atlanta that's sterling. Thank God for her. She'll<br> help me do something about it.’<br><br> ‘And what are you going to do?’<br><br> ‘Do? I'm going to cultivate every female dragon of the Old Guard<br> in this town, especially Mrs. Merriwether, Mrs. Elsing, Mrs.<br> Whiting and Mrs. Meade. If I have to crawl on my belly to every<br> fat old cat who hates me, I'll do it. I'll be meek under their<br> coldness and repentant of my evil ways. I'll contribute to their<br> damned charities and I'll go to their damned churches. I'll admit<br> and brag about my services to the Confederacy and, if worst comes<br> to worst, I'll join their damned Klan--though a merciful God could<br> hardly lay so heavy a penance on my shoulders as that. And I shall<br> not hesitate to remind the fools whose necks I saved that they owe<br> me a debt. And you, Madam, will kindly refrain from undoing my<br> work behind my back and foreclosing mortgages on any of the people<br> I'm courting or selling them rotten lumber or in other ways<br> insulting them. And Governor Bullock never sets foot in this house<br> again. Do you hear? And none of this gang of elegant thieves<br> you've been associating with, either. If you do invite them, over<br> my request, you will find yourself in the embarrassing position of<br> having no host in your home. If they come in this house, I will<br> spend the time in Belle Watling's bar telling anyone who cares to<br> hear that I won't stay under the same roof with them.’<br><br> Scarlett, who had been smarting under his words, laughed shortly.<br><br> ‘So the river-boat gambler and the speculator is going to be<br> respectable! Well, your first move toward respectability had<br> better be the sale of Belle Watling's house.’<br><br> That was a shot in the dark. She had never been absolutely certain<br> that Rhett owned the house. He laughed suddenly, as though he read<br> her mind.<br><br> ‘Thanks for the suggestion.’<br><br> <br><br> Had he tried, Rhett could not have chosen a more difficult time to<br> beat his way back to respectability. Never before or after did the<br> names Republican and Scallawag carry such odium, for now the<br> corruption of the Carpet bag regime was at its height. And, since<br> the surrender, Rhett's name had been inextricably linked with<br> Yankees, Republicans and Scallawags.<br><br> Atlanta people had thought, with helpless fury, in 1866, that<br> nothing could be worse than the harsh military rule they had then,<br> but now, under Bullock, they were learning the worst. Thanks to<br> the negro vote, the Republicans and their allies were firmly<br> entrenched and they were riding rough-shod over the powerless but<br> still protesting minority.<br><br> Word had been spread among the negroes that there were only two<br> political parties mentioned in the Bible, the Publicans and the<br> Sinners. No negro wanted to join a party made up entirely of<br> sinners, so they hastened to join the Republicans. Their new<br> masters voted them over and over again, electing poor whites and<br> Scallawags to high places, electing even some negroes. These<br> negroes sat in the legislature where they spent most of their time<br> eating goobers and easing their unaccustomed feet into and out of<br> new shoes. Few of them could read or write. They were fresh from<br> cotton patch and canebrake, but it was within their power to vote<br> taxes and bonds as well as enormous expense accounts to themselves<br> and their Republican friends. And they voted them. The state<br> staggered under taxes which were paid in fury, for the taxpayers<br> knew that much of the money voted for public purposes was finding<br> its way into private pockets.<br><br> Completely surrounding the state capitol was a host of promoters,<br> speculators, seekers after contracts and others hoping to profit<br> from the orgy of spending, and many were growing shamelessly rich.<br> They had no difficulty at all in obtaining the state's money for<br> building railroads that were never built, for buying cars and<br> engines that were never bought, for erecting public buildings that<br> never existed except in the minds of their promoters.<br><br> Bonds were issued running into the millions. Most of them were<br> illegal and fraudulent but they were issued just the same. The<br> state treasurer, a Republican but an honest man, protested against<br> the illegal issues and refused to sign them, but he and others who<br> sought to check the abuses could do nothing against the tide that<br> was running.<br><br> The state-owned railroad had once been an asset to the state but<br> now it was a liability and its debts had piled up to the million<br> mark. It was no longer a railroad. It was an enormous bottomless<br> trough in which the hogs could swill and wallow. Many of its<br> officials were appointed for political reasons, regardless of their<br> knowledge of the operation of railroads, there were three times as<br> many people employed as were necessary, Republicans rode free on<br> passes, carloads of negroes rode free on their happy jaunts about<br> the state to vote and revote in the same elections.<br><br> The mismanagement of the state road especially infuriated the<br> taxpayers for, out of the earnings of the road, was to come the<br> money for free schools. But there were no earnings, there were<br> only debts, and so there were no free schools and there was a<br> generation of children growing up in ignorance who would spread the<br> seeds of illiteracy down the years.<br><br> But far and above their anger at the waste and mismanagement and<br> graft was the resentment of the people at the bad light in which<br> the governor represented them in the North. When Georgia howled<br> against corruption, the governor hastily went North, appeared<br> before Congress and told of white outrages against negroes, of<br> Georgia's preparation for another rebellion and the need for a<br> stern military rule in the state. No Georgian wanted trouble with<br> the negroes and they tried to avoid trouble. No one wanted another<br> war, no one wanted or needed bayonet rule. All Georgia wanted was<br> to be let alone so the state could recuperate. But with the<br> operation of what came to be known as the governor's ‘slander<br> mill,’ the North saw only a rebellious state that needed a heavy<br> hand, and a heavy hand was laid upon it.<br><br> It was a glorious spree for the gang which had Georgia by the<br> throat. There was an orgy of grabbing and over all there was a<br> cold cynicism about open theft in high places that was chilling to<br> contemplate. Protests and efforts to resist accomplished nothing,<br> for the state government was being upheld and supported by the<br> power of the United States Army.<br><br> Atlanta cursed the name of Bullock and his Scallawags and<br> Republicans and they cursed the name of anyone connected with them.<br> And Rhett was connected with them. He had been in with them, so<br> everyone said, in all their schemes. But now, he turned against<br> the stream in which he had drifted so short a while before, and<br> began swimming arduously back against the current.<br><br> He went about his campaign slowly, subtly, not arousing the<br> suspicions of Atlanta by the spectacle of a leopard trying to<br> change his spots overnight. He avoided his dubious cronies and was<br> seen no more in the company of Yankee officers, Scallawags and<br> Republicans. He attended Democratic rallies and he ostentatiously<br> voted the Democratic ticket. He gave up high-stake card games and<br> stayed comparatively sober. If he went to Belle Watling's house at<br> all, he went by night and by stealth as did more respectable<br> townsmen, instead of leaving his horse hitched in front of her door<br> in the afternoons as an advertisement of his presence within.<br><br> And the congregation of the Episcopal Church almost fell out of<br> their pews when he tiptoed in, late for services, with Wade's hand<br> held in his. The congregation was as much stunned by Wade's<br> appearance as by Rhett's, for the little boy was supposed to be a<br> Catholic. At least, Scarlett was one. Or she was supposed to be<br> one. But she had not put foot in the church in years, for religion<br> had gone from her as many of Ellen's other teachings had gone.<br> Everyone thought she had neglected her boy's religious education<br> and thought more of Rhett for trying to rectify the matter, even if<br> he did take the boy to the Episcopal Church instead of the<br> Catholic.<br><br> Rhett could be grave of manner and charming when he chose to<br> restrain his tongue and keep his black eyes from dancing maliciously.<br> It had been years since he had chosen to do this but he did it now,<br> putting on gravity and charm, even as he put on waistcoats of more<br> sober hues. It was not difficult to gain a foothold of friendliness<br> with the men who owed their necks to him. They would have showed<br> their appreciation long ago, had Rhett not acted as if their<br> appreciation were a matter of small moment. Now, Hugh Elsing, Rene,<br> the Simmons boys, Andy Bonnell and the others found him pleasant,<br> diffident about putting himself forward and embarrassed when they<br> spoke of the obligation they owed him.<br><br> ‘It was nothing,’ he would protest. ‘In my place you'd have all<br> done the same thing.’<br><br> He subscribed handsomely to the fund for the repairs of the<br> Episcopal Church and he gave a large, but not vulgarly large,<br> contribution to the Association for the Beautification of the<br> Graves of Our Glorious Dead. He sought out Mrs. Elsing to make<br> this donation and embarrassedly begged that she keep his gift a<br> secret, knowing very well that this would spur her to spreading the<br> news. Mrs. Elsing hated to take his money--’speculator money’--but<br> the Association needed money badly.<br><br> ‘I don't see why you of all people should be subscribing,’ she said<br> acidly.<br><br> When Rhett told her with the proper sober mien that he was moved to<br> contribute by the memories of former comrades in arms, braver than<br> he but less fortunate, who now lay in unmarked graves, Mrs.<br> Elsing's aristocratic jaw dropped. Dolly Merriwether had told her<br> Scarlett had said Captain Butler was in the army but, of course,<br> she hadn't believed it. Nobody had believed it.<br><br> ‘You in the army? What was your company--your regiment?’<br><br> Rhett gave them.<br><br> ‘Oh, the artillery! Everyone I knew was either in the cavalry or<br> the infantry. Then, that explains--’ She broke off, disconcerted,<br> expecting to see his eyes snap with malice. But he only looked<br> down and toyed with his watch chain.<br><br> ‘I would have liked the infantry,’ he said, passing completely over<br> her insinuation, ‘but when they found that I was a West Pointer--<br> though I did not graduate, Mrs. Elsing, due to a boyish prank--they<br> put me in the artillery, the regular artillery, not the militia.<br> They needed men with specialized knowledge in that last campaign.<br> You know how heavy the losses had been, so many artillerymen<br> killed. It was pretty lonely in the artillery. I didn't see a<br> soul I knew. I don't believe I saw a single man from Atlanta<br> during my whole service.’<br><br> ‘Well!’ said Mrs. Elsing, confused. If he had been in the army<br> then she was wrong. She had made many sharp remarks about his<br> cowardice and the memory of them made her feel guilty. ‘Well! And<br> why haven't you ever told anybody about your service? You act as<br> though you were ashamed of it.’<br><br> Rhett looked her squarely in the eyes, his face blank.<br><br> ‘Mrs. Elsing,’ he said earnestly, ‘believe me when I say that I am<br> prouder of my services to the Confederacy than of anything I have<br> ever done or will do. I feel--I feel--’<br><br> ‘Well, why did you keep it hidden?’<br><br> ‘I was ashamed to speak of it, in the light of--of some of my<br> former actions.’<br><br> Mrs. Elsing reported the contribution and the conversation in<br> detail to Mrs. Merriwether.<br><br> ‘And, Dolly, I give you my word that when he said that about being<br> ashamed, tears came into his eyes! Yes, tears! I nearly cried<br> myself.’<br><br> ‘Stuff and nonsense!’ cried Mrs. Merriwether in disbelief. ‘I don't<br> believe tears came into his eyes any more than I believe he was in<br> the army. And I can find out mighty quick. If he was in that<br> artillery outfit, I can get at the truth, for Colonel Carleton who<br> commanded it married the daughter of one of my grandfather's<br> sisters and I'll write him.’<br><br> She wrote Colonel Carlton and to her consternation received a reply<br> praising Rhett's services in no uncertain terms. A born<br> artilleryman, a brave soldier and an uncomplaining gentleman, a<br> modest man who wouldn't even take a commission when it was offered<br> him.<br><br> ‘Well!’ said Mrs. Merriwether showing the letter to Mrs. Elsing.<br> ‘You can knock me down with a feather! Maybe we did misjudge the<br> scamp about not being a soldier. Maybe we should have believed<br> what Scarlett and Melanie said about him enlisting the day the town<br> fell. But, just the same, he's a Scallawag and a rascal and I<br> don't like him!’<br><br> ‘Somehow,’ said Mrs. Elsing uncertainly, ‘somehow, I don't think<br> he's so bad. A man who fought for the Confederacy can't be all<br> bad. It's Scarlett who is the bad one. Do you know, Dolly, I<br> really believe that he--well, he's ashamed of Scarlett but is too<br> much of a gentleman to let on.’<br><br> ‘Ashamed! Pooh! They're both cut out of the same piece of cloth.<br> Where did you ever get such a silly notion?’<br><br> ‘It isn't silly,’ said Mrs. Elsing indignantly. ‘Yesterday, in the<br> pouring rain, he had those three children, even the baby, mind you,<br> out in his carriage riding them up and down Peachtree Street and he<br> gave me a lift home. And when I said: 'Captain Butler, have you<br> lost your mind keeping these children out in the damp? Why don't<br> you take them home?' And he didn't say a word but just looked<br> embarrassed. But Mammy spoke up and said: 'De house full of w'ite<br> trash an' it healthier fer de chillun in de rain dan at home!'‘<br><br> ‘What did he say?’<br><br> ‘What could he say? He just scowled at Mammy and passed it over.<br> You know Scarlett was giving a big whist party yesterday afternoon<br> with all those common ordinary women there. I guess he didn't want<br> them kissing his baby.’<br><br> ‘Well!’ said Mrs. Merriwether, wavering but still obstinate. But<br> the next week she, too, capitulated.<br><br> Rhett now had a desk in the bank. What he did at this desk the<br> bewildered officials of the bank did not know, but he owned too<br> large a block of the stock for them to protest his presence there.<br> After a while they forgot that they had objected to him for he was<br> quiet and well mannered and actually knew something about banking<br> and investments. At any rate he sat at his desk all day, giving<br> every appearance of industry, for he wished to be on equal terms<br> with his respectable fellow townsmen who worked and worked hard.<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether, wishing to expand her growing bakery, had tried<br> to borrow two thousand dollars from the bank with her house as<br> security. She had been refused because there were already two<br> mortgages on the house. The stout old lady was storming out of the<br> bank when Rhett stopped her, learned the trouble and said,<br> worriedly: ‘But there must be some mistake, Mrs. Merriwether.<br> Some dreadful mistake. You of all people shouldn't have to bother<br> about collateral. Why, I'd lend you money just on your word! Any<br> lady who could build up the business you've built up is the best<br> risk in the world. The bank wants to lend money to people like<br> you. Now, do sit down right here in my chair and I will attend to<br> it for you.’<br><br> When he came back he was smiling blandly, saying that there had<br> been a mistake, just as he had thought. The two thousand dollars<br> was right there waiting for her whenever she cared to draw against<br> it. Now, about her house--would she just sign right here?<br><br> Mrs. Merriwether, torn with indignation and insult, furious that<br> she had to take this favor from a man she disliked and distrusted,<br> was hardly gracious in her thanks.<br><br> But he failed to notice it. As he escorted her to the door, he<br> said: ‘Mrs. Merriwether, I have always had a great regard for your<br> knowledge and I wonder if you could tell me something?’<br><br> The plumes on her bonnet barely moved as she nodded.<br><br> ‘What did you do when your Maybelle was little and she sucked her<br> thumb?’<br><br> ‘What?’<br><br> ‘My Bonnie sucks her thumb. I can't make her stop it.’<br><br> ‘You should make her stop it,’ said Mrs. Merriwether vigorously.<br> ‘It will ruin the shape of her mouth.’<br><br> ‘I know! I know! And she has a beautiful mouth. But I don't know<br> what to do.’<br><br> ‘Well, Scarlett ought to know,’ said Mrs. Merriwether shortly.<br> ‘She's had two other children.’<br><br> Rhett looked down at his shoes and sighed.<br><br> ‘I've tried putting soap under her finger nails,’ he said, passing<br> over her remark about Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Soap! Bah! Soap is no good at all. I put quinine on Maybelle's<br> thumb and let me tell you, Captain Butler, she stopped sucking that<br> thumb mighty quick.’<br><br> ‘Quinine! I would never have thought of it! I can't thank you<br> enough, Mrs. Merriwether. It was worrying me.’<br><br> He gave her a smile, so pleasant, so grateful that Mrs. Merriwether<br> stood uncertainly for a moment. But as she told him good-by she<br> was smiling too. She hated to admit to Mrs. Elsing that she had<br> misjudged the man but she was an honest person and she said there<br> had to be something good about a man who loved his child. What a<br> pity Scarlett took no interest in so pretty a creature as Bonnie!<br> There was something pathetic about a man trying to raise a little<br> girl all by himself! Rhett knew very well the pathos of the<br> spectacle, and if it blackened Scarlett's reputation he did not<br> care.<br><br> From the time the child could walk he took her about with him<br> constantly, in the carriage or in front of his saddle. When he<br> came home from the bank in the afternoon, he took her walking down<br> Peachtree Street, holding her hand, slowing his long strides to her<br> toddling steps, patiently answering her thousand questions. People<br> were always in their front yards or on their porches at sunset and,<br> as Bonnie was such a friendly, pretty child, with her tangle of<br> black curls and her bright blue eyes, few could resist talking to<br> her. Rhett never presumed on these conversations but stood by,<br> exuding fatherly pride and gratification at the notice taken of his<br> daughter.<br><br> Atlanta had a long memory and was suspicious and slow to change.<br> Times were hard and feeling was bitter against anyone who had had<br> anything to do with Bullock and his crowd. But Bonnie had the<br> combined charm of Scarlett and Rhett at their best and she was the<br> small opening wedge Rhett drove into the wall of Atlanta's<br> coldness.<br><br> <br><br> Bonnie grew rapidly and every day it became more evident that<br> Gerald O'Hara had been her grandfather. She had short sturdy legs<br> and wide eyes of Irish blue and a small square jaw that went with a<br> determination to have her own way. She had Gerald's sudden temper<br> to which she gave vent in screaming tantrums that were forgotten as<br> soon as her wishes were gratified. And as long as her father was<br> near her, they were always gratified hastily. He spoiled her<br> despite all the efforts of Mammy and Scarlett, for in all things<br> she pleased him, except one. And that was her fear of the dark.<br><br> Until she was two years old she went to sleep readily in the<br> nursery she shared with Wade and Ella. Then, for no apparent<br> reason, she began to sob whenever Mammy waddled out of the room,<br> carrying the lamp. From this she progressed to wakening in the<br> late night hours, screaming with terror, frightening the other two<br> children and alarming the house. Once Dr. Meade had to be called<br> and Rhett was short with him when he diagnosed only bad dreams.<br> All anyone could get from her was one word, ‘Dark.’<br><br> Scarlett was inclined to be irritated with the child and favored a<br> spanking. She would not humor her by leaving a lamp burning in the<br> nursery, for then Wade and Ella would be unable to sleep. Rhett,<br> worried but gentle, attempting to extract further information from<br> his daughter, said coldly that if any spanking were done, he would<br> do it personally and to Scarlett.<br><br> The upshot of the situation was that Bonnie was removed from the<br> nursery to the room Rhett now occupied alone. Her small bed was<br> placed beside his large one and a shaded lamp burned on the table<br> all night long. The town buzzed when this story got about.<br> Somehow, there was something indelicate about a girl child sleeping<br> in her father's room, even though the girl was only two years old.<br> Scarlett suffered from this gossip in two ways. First, it proved<br> indubitably that she and her husband occupied separate rooms, in<br> itself a shocking enough state of affairs. Second, everyone<br> thought that if the child was afraid to sleep alone, her place was<br> with her mother. And Scarlett did not feel equal to explaining<br> that she could not sleep in a lighted room nor would Rhett permit<br> the child to sleep with her.<br><br> ‘You'd never wake up unless she screamed and then you'd probably<br> slap her,’ he said shortly.<br><br> Scarlett was annoyed at the weight he attached to Bonnie's night<br> terrors but she thought she could eventually remedy the state of<br> affairs and transfer the child back to the nursery. All children<br> were afraid of the dark and the only cure was firmness. Rhett was<br> just being perverse in the matter, making her appear a poor mother,<br> just to pay her back for banishing him from her room.<br><br> He had never put foot in her room or even rattled the door knob<br> since the night she told him she did not want any more children.<br> Thereafter and until he began staying at home on account of<br> Bonnie's fears, he had been absent from the supper table more often<br> than he had been present. Sometimes he had stayed out all night<br> and Scarlett, lying awake behind her locked door, hearing the clock<br> count off the early morning hours, wondered where he was. She<br> remembered: ‘There are other beds, my dear!’ Though the thought<br> made her writhe, there was nothing she could do about it. There<br> was nothing she could say that would not precipitate a scene in<br> which he would be sure to remark upon her locked door and the<br> probable connection Ashley had with it. Yes, his foolishness about<br> Bonnie sleeping in a lighted room--in his lighted room--was just a<br> mean way of paying her back.<br><br> She did not realize the importance he attached to Bonnie's<br> foolishness nor the completeness of his devotion to the child until<br> one dreadful night. The family never forgot that night.<br><br> That day Rhett had met an ex-blockade runner and they had had much<br> to say to each other. Where they had gone to talk and drink,<br> Scarlett did not know but she suspected, of course, Belle Watling's<br> house. He did not come home in the afternoon to take Bonnie<br> walking nor did he come home to supper. Bonnie, who had watched<br> from the window impatiently all afternoon, anxious to display a<br> mangled collection of beetles and roaches to her father, had<br> finally been put to bed by Lou, amid wails and protests.<br><br> Either Lou had forgotten to light the lamp or it had burned out.<br> No one ever knew exactly what happened but when Rhett finally came<br> home, somewhat the worse for drink, the house was in an uproar and<br> Bonnie's screams reached him even in the stables. She had waked in<br> darkness and called for him and he had not been there. All the<br> nameless horrors that peopled her small imagination clutched her.<br> All the soothing and bright lights brought by Scarlett and the<br> servants could not quiet her and Rhett, coming up the stairs three<br> at a jump, looked like a man who has seen Death.<br><br> When he finally had her in his arms and from her sobbing gasps had<br> recognized only one word, ‘Dark,’ he turned on Scarlett and the<br> negroes in fury.<br><br> ‘Who put out the light? Who left her alone in the dark? Prissy,<br> I'll skin you for this, you--’<br><br> ‘Gawdlmighty, Mist' Rhett! 'Twarn't me! 'Twuz Lou!’<br><br> ‘Fo' Gawd, Mist' Rhett, Ah--’<br><br> ‘Shut up. You know my orders. By God, I'll--get out. Don't come<br> back. Scarlett, give her some money and see that she's gone before<br> I come down stairs. Now, everybody get out, everybody!’<br><br> The negroes fled, the luckless Lou wailing into her apron. But<br> Scarlett remained. It was hard to see her favorite child quieting<br> in Rhett's arms when she had screamed so pitifully in her own. It<br> was hard to see the small arms going around his neck and hear the<br> choking voice relate what had frightened her, when she, Scarlett,<br> had gotten nothing coherent out of her.<br><br> ‘So it sat on your chest,’ said Rhett softly. ‘Was it a big one?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes! Dretfull big. And claws.’<br><br> ‘Ah, claws, too. Well, now. I shall certainly sit up all night<br> and shoot him if he comes back.’ Rhett's voice was interested and<br> soothing and Bonnie's sobs died away. Her voice became less choked<br> as she went into detailed description of her monster guest in a<br> language which only he could understand. Irritation stirred in<br> Scarlett as Rhett discussed the matter as if it had been something<br> real.<br><br> ‘For Heaven's sake, Rhett--’<br><br> But he made a sign for silence. When Bonnie was at last asleep, he<br> laid her in her bed and pulled up the sheet.<br><br> ‘I'm going to skin that nigger alive,’ he said quietly. ‘It's your<br> fault too. Why didn't you come up here to see if the light was<br> burning?’<br><br> ‘Don't be a fool, Rhett,’ she whispered. ‘She gets this way<br> because you humor her. Lots of children are afraid of the dark but<br> they get over it. Wade was afraid but I didn't pamper him. If<br> you'd just let her scream for a night or two--’<br><br> ‘Let her scream!’ For a moment Scarlett thought he would hit her.<br> ‘Either you are a fool or the most inhuman woman I've ever seen.’<br><br> ‘I don't want her to grow up nervous and cowardly.’<br><br> ‘Cowardly? Hell's afire! There isn't a cowardly bone in her body!<br> But you haven't any imagination and, of course, you can't<br> appreciate the tortures of people who have one--especially a child.<br> If something with claws and horns came and sat on your chest, you'd<br> tell it to get the hell off you, wouldn't you? Like hell you<br> would. Kindly remember, Madam, that I've seen you wake up<br> squalling like a scalded cat simply because you dreamed of running<br> in a fog. And that's not been so long ago either!’<br><br> Scarlett was taken aback, for she never liked to think of that<br> dream. Moreover, it embarrassed her to remember that Rhett had<br> comforted her in much the same manner he comforted Bonnie. So she<br> swung rapidly to a different attack.<br><br> ‘You are just humoring her and--’<br><br> ‘And I intend to keep on humoring her. If I do, she'll outgrow it<br> and forget about it.’<br><br> ‘Then,’ said Scarlett acidly, ‘if you intend to play nursemaid, you<br> might try coming home nights and sober too, for a change.’<br><br> ‘I shall come home early but drunk as a fiddler's bitch if I<br> please.’<br><br> He did come home early thereafter, arriving long before time for<br> Bonnie to be put to bed. He sat beside her, holding her hand until<br> sleep loosened her grasp. Only then did he tiptoe downstairs,<br> leaving the lamp burning brightly and the door ajar so he might<br> hear her should she awake and become frightened. Never again did<br> he intend her to have a recurrence of fear of the dark. The whole<br> household was acutely conscious of the burning light, Scarlett,<br> Mammy, Prissy and Pork, frequently tiptoeing upstairs to make sure<br> that it still burned.<br><br> He came home sober too, but that was none of Scarlett's doing. For<br> months he had been drinking heavily, though he was never actually<br> drunk, and one evening the smell of whisky was especially strong<br> upon his breath. He picked up Bonnie, swung her to his shoulder<br> and asked her: ‘Have you a kiss for your sweetheart?’<br><br> She wrinkled her small upturned nose and wriggled to get down from<br> his arms.<br><br> ‘No,’ she said frankly. ‘Nasty.’<br><br> ‘I'm what?’<br><br> ‘Smell nasty. Uncle Ashley don't smell nasty.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'll be damned,’ he said ruefully, putting her on the floor.<br> ‘I never expected to find a temperance advocate in my own home, of<br> all places!’<br><br> But, thereafter, he limited his drinking to a glass of wine after<br> supper. Bonnie, who was always permitted to have the last drops in<br> the glass, did not think the smell of wine nasty at all. As the<br> result, the puffiness which had begun to obscure the hard lines of<br> his cheeks slowly disappeared and the circles beneath his black<br> eyes were not so dark or so harshly cut. Because Bonnie liked to<br> ride on the front of his saddle, he stayed out of doors more and<br> the sunburn began to creep across his dark face, making him<br> swarthier than ever. He looked healthier and laughed more and was<br> again like the dashing young blockader who had excited Atlanta<br> early in the war.<br><br> People who had never liked him came to smile as he went by with the<br> small figure perched before him on his saddle. Women who had<br> heretofore believed that no woman was safe with him, began to stop<br> and talk with him on the streets, to admire Bonnie. Even the<br> strictest old ladies felt that a man who could discuss the ailments<br> and problems of childhood as well as he did could not be altogether<br> bad.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LIII<br><br> <br> It was Ashley's birthday and Melanie was giving him a surprise<br> reception that night. Everyone knew about the reception, except<br> Ashley. Even Wade and little Beau knew and were sworn to secrecy<br> that puffed them up with pride. Everyone in Atlanta who was nice<br> had been invited and was coming. General Gordon and his family had<br> graciously accepted, Alexander Stephens would be present if his<br> ever-uncertain health permitted and even Bob Toombs, the stormy<br> petrel of the Confederacy, was expected.<br><br> All that morning, Scarlett, with Melanie, India and Aunt Pitty flew<br> about the little house, directing the negroes as they hung freshly<br> laundered curtains, polished silver, waxed the floor and cooked,<br> stirred and tasted the refreshments. Scarlett had never seen<br> Melanie so excited or so happy.<br><br> ‘You see, dear, Ashley hasn't had a birthday party since--since,<br> you remember the barbecue at Twelve Oaks? The day we heard about<br> Mr. Lincoln's call for volunteers? Well, he hasn't had a birthday<br> party since then. And he works so hard and he's so tired when he<br> gets home at night that he really hasn't thought about today being<br> his birthday. And won't he be surprised after supper when<br> everybody troops in!’<br><br> ‘How you goin' to manage them lanterns on the lawn without Mr.<br> Wilkes seein' them when he comes home to supper?’ demanded Archie<br> grumpily.<br><br> He had sat all morning watching the preparations, interested but<br> unwilling to admit it. He had never been behind the scenes at a<br> large town folks' party and it was a new experience. He made frank<br> remarks about women running around like the house was afire, just<br> because they were having company, but wild horses could not have<br> dragged him from the scene. The colored-paper lanterns which Mrs.<br> Elsing and Fanny had made and painted for the occasion held a<br> special interest for him, as he had never seen ‘sech contraptions’<br> before. They had been hidden in his room in the cellar and he had<br> examined them minutely.<br><br> ‘Mercy! I hadn't thought of that!’ cried Melanie. ‘Archie, how<br> fortunate that you mentioned it. Dear, dear! What shall I do?<br> They've got to be strung on the bushes and trees and little candles<br> put in them and lighted just at the proper time when the guests are<br> arriving. Scarlett, can you send Pork down to do it while we're<br> eating supper?’<br><br> ‘Miz Wilkes, you got more sense than most women but you gits<br> flurried right easy,’ said Archie. ‘And as for that fool nigger,<br> Pork, he ain't got no bizness with them thar contraptions. He'd<br> set them afire in no time. They are--right pretty,’ he conceded.<br> ‘I'll hang them for you, whilst you and Mr. Wilkes are eatin'.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Archie, how kind of you!’ Melanie turned childlike eyes of<br> gratitude and dependence upon him. ‘I don't know what I should do<br> without you. Do you suppose you could go put the candles in them<br> now, so we'd have that much out of the way?’<br><br> ‘Well, I could, p'raps,’ said Archie ungraciously and stumped off<br> toward the cellar stairs.<br><br> ‘There's more ways of killing a cat than choking him to death with<br> butter,’ giggled Melanie when the whiskered old man had thumped<br> down the stairs. ‘I had intended all along for Archie to put up<br> those lanterns but you know how he is. He won't do a thing if you<br> ask him to. And now we've got him out from underfoot for a while.<br> The darkies are so scared of him they just won't do any work when<br> he's around, breathing down their necks.’<br><br> ‘Melly, I wouldn't have that old desperado in my house,’ said<br> Scarlett crossly. She hated Archie as much as he hated her and<br> they barely spoke. Melanie's was the only house in which he would<br> remain if she were present. And even in Melanie's house, he stared<br> at her with suspicion and cold contempt. ‘He'll cause you trouble,<br> mark my words.’<br><br> ‘Oh, he's harmless if you flatter him and act like you depend on<br> him,’ said Melanie. ‘And he's so devoted to Ashley and Beau that I<br> always feel safe having him around.’<br><br> ‘You mean he's so devoted to you, Melly,’ said India, her cold face<br> relaxing into a faintly warm smile as her gaze rested fondly on her<br> sister-in-law. ‘I believe you're the first person that old ruffian<br> has loved since his wife--er--since his wife. I think he'd really<br> like for somebody to insult you, so he could kill them to show his<br> respect for you.’<br><br> ‘Mercy! How you run on, India!’ said Melanie blushing. ‘He thinks<br> I'm a terrible goose and you know it.’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't see that what that smelly old hill-billy thinks is<br> of any importance,’ said Scarlett abruptly. The very thought of<br> how Archie had sat in judgment upon her about the convicts always<br> enraged her. ‘I have to go now. I've got to go get dinner and<br> then go by the store and pay off the clerks and go by the lumber<br> yard and pay the drivers and Hugh Elsing.’<br><br> ‘Oh, are you going to the lumber yard?’ asked Melanie. ‘Ashley is<br> coming in to the yard in the late afternoon to see Hugh. Can you<br> possibly hold him there till five o'clock? If he comes home<br> earlier he'll be sure to catch us finishing up a cake or something<br> and then he won't be surprised at all.’<br><br> Scarlett smiled inwardly, good temper restored.<br><br> ‘Yes, I'll hold him,’ she said.<br><br> As she spoke, India's pale lashless eyes met hers piercingly. She<br> always looks at me so oddly when I speak of Ashley, thought<br> Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Well, hold him there as long as you can after five o'clock,’ said<br> Melanie. ‘And then India will drive down and pick him up. . . .<br> Scarlett, do come early tonight. I don't want you to miss a minute<br> of the reception.’<br><br> As Scarlett rode home she thought sullenly: ‘She doesn't want me<br> to miss a minute of the reception, eh? Well then, why didn't she<br> invite me to receive with her and India and Aunt Pitty?’<br><br> Generally, Scarlett would not have cared whether she received at<br> Melly's piddling parties or not. But this was the largest party<br> Melanie had ever given and Ashley's birthday party too, and<br> Scarlett longed to stand by Ashley's side and receive with him.<br> But she knew why she had not been invited to receive. Even had she<br> not known it, Rhett's comment on the subject had been frank enough.<br><br> ‘A Scallawag receive when all the prominent ex-Confederates and<br> Democrats are going to be there? Your notions are as enchanting as<br> they are muddle headed. It's only because of Miss Melly's loyalty<br> that you are invited at all.’<br><br> Scarlett dressed with more than usual care that afternoon for her<br> trip to the store and the lumber yard, wearing the new dull-green<br> changeable taffeta frock that looked lilac in some lights and the<br> new pale-green bonnet, circled about with dark-green plumes. If<br> only Rhett would let her cut bangs and frizzle them on her<br> forehead, how much better this bonnet would look! But he had<br> declared that he would shave her whole head if she banged her<br> forelocks. And these days he acted so atrociously he really might<br> do it.<br><br> It was a lovely afternoon, sunny but not too hot, bright but not<br> glaring, and the warm breeze that rustled the trees along Peachtree<br> Street made the plumes on Scarlett's bonnet dance. Her heart<br> danced too, as always when she was going to see Ashley. Perhaps,<br> if she paid off the team drivers and Hugh early, they would go home<br> and leave her and Ashley alone in the square little office in the<br> middle of the lumber yard. Chances to see Ashley alone were all<br> too infrequent these days. And to think that Melanie had asked her<br> to hold him! That was funny!<br><br> Her heart was merry when she reached the store, and she paid off<br> Willie and the other counter boys without even asking what the<br> day's business had been. It was Saturday, the biggest day of the<br> week for the store, for all the farmers came to town to shop that<br> day, but she asked no questions.<br><br> Along the way to the lumber yard she stopped a dozen times to speak<br> with Carpetbagger ladies in splendid equipages--not so splendid as<br> her own, she thought with pleasure--and with many men who came<br> through the red dust of the street to stand hat in hand and<br> compliment her. It was a beautiful afternoon, she was happy, she<br> looked pretty and her progress was a royal one. Because of these<br> delays she arrived at the lumber yard later than she intended and<br> found Hugh and the team drivers sitting on a low pile of lumber<br> waiting for her.<br><br> ‘Is Ashley here?’<br><br> ‘Yes, he's in the office,’ said Hugh, the habitually worried<br> expression leaving his face at the sight of her happy, dancing<br> eyes. ‘He's trying to--I mean, he's going over the books.’<br><br> ‘Oh, he needn't bother about that today,’ she said and then<br> lowering her voice: ‘Melly sent me down to keep him here till they<br> get the house straight for the reception tonight.’<br><br> Hugh smiled for he was going to the reception. He liked parties<br> and he guessed Scarlett did too from the way she looked this<br> afternoon. She paid off the teamsters and Hugh and, abruptly<br> leaving them, walked toward the office, showing plainly by her<br> manner that she did not care to be accompanied. Ashley met her at<br> the door and stood in the afternoon sunshine, his hair bright and<br> on his lips a little smile that was almost a grin.<br><br> ‘Why, Scarlett, what are you doing downtown this time of the day?<br> Why aren't you out at my house helping Melly get ready for the<br> surprise party?’<br><br> ‘Why, Ashley Wilkes!’ she cried indignantly. ‘You weren't supposed<br> to know a thing about it. Melly will be so disappointed if you<br> aren't surprised.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I won't let on. I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta,’<br> said Ashley, his eyes laughing.<br><br> ‘Now, who was mean enough to tell you?’<br><br> ‘Practically every man Melly invited. General Gordon was the<br> first. He said it had been his experience that when women gave<br> surprise parties they usually gave them on the very nights men had<br> decided to polish and clean all the guns in the house. And then<br> Grandpa Merriwether warned me. He said Mrs. Merriwether gave him a<br> surprise party once and she was the most surprised person there,<br> because Grandpa had been treating his rheumatism, on the sly, with<br> a bottle of whisky and he was too drunk to get out of bed and--oh,<br> every man who's ever had a surprise party given him told me.’<br><br> ‘The mean things!’ cried Scarlett but she had to smile.<br><br> He looked like the old Ashley she knew at twelve Oaks when he<br> smiled like this. And he smiled so seldom these days. The air was<br> so soft, the sun so gentle, Ashley's face so gay, his talk so<br> unconstrained that her heart leaped with happiness. It swelled in<br> her bosom until it positively ached with pleasure, ached as with a<br> burden of joyful, hot, unshed tears. Suddenly she felt sixteen<br> again and happy, a little breathless and excited. She had a mad<br> impulse to snatch off her bonnet and toss it into the air and cry<br> ‘Hurray!’ Then she thought how startled Ashley would be if she did<br> this, and she suddenly laughed, laughed until tears came to her<br> eyes. He laughed, too, throwing back his head as though he enjoyed<br> laughter, thinking her mirth came from the friendly treachery of<br> the men who had given Melly's secret away.<br><br> ‘Come in, Scarlett. I'm going over the books.’<br><br> She passed into the small room, blazing with the afternoon sun, and<br> sat down in the chair before the roll-topped desk. Ashley,<br> following her, seated himself on the corner of the rough table, his<br> long legs dangling easily.<br><br> ‘Oh, don't let's fool with any books this afternoon, Ashley! I<br> just can't be bothered. When I'm wearing a new bonnet, it seems<br> like all the figures I know leave my head.’<br><br> ‘Figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that one,’ he<br> said. ‘Scarlett, you get prettier all the time!’<br><br> He slipped from the table and, laughing, took her hands, spreading<br> them wide so he could see her dress. ‘You are so pretty! I don't<br> believe you'll ever get old!’<br><br> At his touch she realized that, without being conscious of it, she<br> had hoped that just this thing would happen. All this happy<br> afternoon, she had hoped for the warmth of his hands, the<br> tenderness of his eyes, a word that would show he cared. This was<br> the first time they had been utterly alone since the cold day in<br> the orchard at Tara, the first time their hands had met in any but<br> formal gestures, and through the long months she had hungered for<br> closer contact. But now--<br><br> How odd that the touch of his hands did not excite her! Once his<br> very nearness would have set her a-tremble. Now she felt a curious<br> warm friendliness and content. No fever leaped from his hands to<br> hers and in his hands her heart hushed to happy quietness. This<br> puzzled her, made her a little disconcerted. He was still her<br> Ashley, still her bright, shining darling and she loved him better<br> than life. Then why--<br><br> But she pushed the thought from her mind. It was enough that she<br> was with him and he was holding her hands and smiling, completely<br> friendly, without strain or fever. It seemed miraculous that this<br> could be when she thought of all the unsaid things that lay between<br> them. His eyes looked into hers, clear and shining, smiling in the<br> old way she loved, smiling as though there had never been anything<br> between them but happiness. There was no barrier between his eyes<br> and hers now, no baffling remoteness. She laughed.<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, I'm getting old and decrepit.’<br><br> ‘Ah, that's very apparent! No, Scarlett, when you are sixty,<br> you'll look the same to me. I'll always remember you as you were<br> that day of our last barbecue, sitting under an oak with a dozen<br> boys around you. I can even tell you just how you were dressed, in<br> a white dress covered with tiny green flowers and a white lace<br> shawl about your shoulders. You had on little green slippers with<br> black lacings and an enormous leghorn hat with long green<br> streamers. I know that dress by heart because when I was in prison<br> and things got too bad, I'd take out my memories and thumb them<br> over like pictures, recalling every little detail--’<br><br> He stopped abruptly and the eager light faded from his face. He<br> dropped her hands gently and she sat waiting, waiting for his next<br> words.<br><br> ‘We've come a long way, both of us, since that day, haven't we,<br> Scarlett? We've traveled roads we never expected to travel.<br> You've come swiftly, directly, and I, slowly and reluctantly.’<br><br> He sat down on the table again and looked at her and a small smile<br> crept back into his face. But it was not the smile that had made<br> her so happy so short a while before. It was a bleak smile.<br><br> ‘Yes, you came swiftly, dragging me at your chariot wheels.<br> Scarlett, sometimes I have an impersonal curiosity as to what would<br> have happened to me without you.’<br><br> Scarlett went quickly to defend him from himself, more quickly<br> because treacherously there rose to her mind Rhett's words on this<br> same subject.<br><br> ‘But I've never done anything for you, Ashley. Without me, you'd<br> have been just the same. Some day, you'd have been a rich man, a<br> great man like you are going to be.’<br><br> ‘No, Scarlett, the seeds of greatness were never in me. I think<br> that if it hadn't been for you, I'd have gone down into oblivion--<br> like poor Cathleen Calvert and so many other people who once had<br> great names, old names.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, don't talk like that. You sound so sad.’<br><br> ‘No, I'm not sad. Not any longer. Once--once I was sad. Now, I'm<br> only--’<br><br> He stopped and suddenly she knew what he was thinking. It was the<br> first time she had ever known what Ashley was thinking when his<br> eyes went past her, crystal clear, absent. When the fury of love<br> had beaten in her heart, his mind had been closed to her. Now, in<br> the quiet friendliness that lay between them, she could walk a<br> little way into his mind, understand a little. He was not sad any<br> longer. He had been sad after the surrender, sad when she begged<br> him to come to Atlanta. Now, he was only resigned.<br><br> ‘I hate to hear you talk like that, Ashley,’ she said vehemently.<br> ‘You sound just like Rhett. He's always harping on things like<br> that and something he calls the survival of the fitting till I'm so<br> bored I could scream.’<br><br> Ashley smiled.<br><br> ‘Did you ever stop to think, Scarlett, that Rhett and I are<br> fundamentally alike?’<br><br> ‘Oh, no! You are so fine, so honorable and he--’ She broke off,<br> confused.<br><br> ‘But we are. We came of the same kind of people, we were raised in<br> the same pattern, brought up to think the same things. And<br> somewhere along the road we took different turnings. We still<br> think alike but we react differently. As, for instance, neither of<br> us believed in the war but I enlisted and fought and he stayed out<br> till nearly the end. We both knew the war was all wrong. We both<br> knew it was a losing fight. I was willing to fight a losing fight.<br> He wasn't. Sometimes I think he was right and then, again--’<br><br> ‘Oh, Ashley, when will you stop seeing both sides of questions?’<br> she asked. But she did not speak impatiently as she once would<br> have done. ‘No one ever gets anywhere seeing both sides.’<br><br> ‘That's true but--Scarlett, just where do you want to get? I've<br> often wondered. You see, I never wanted to get anywhere at all.<br> I've only wanted to be myself.’<br><br> Where did she want to get? That was a silly question. Money and<br> security, of course. And yet-- Her mind fumbled. She had money<br> and as much security as one could hope for in an insecure world.<br> But, now that she thought about it, they weren't quite enough. Now<br> that she thought about it, they hadn't made her particularly happy,<br> though they made her less harried, less fearful of the morrow. If<br> I'd had money and security and you, that would have been where I<br> wanted to get, she thought, looking at him yearningly. But she did<br> not speak the words, fearful of breaking the spell that lay between<br> them, fearful that his mind would close against her.<br><br> ‘You only want to be yourself?’ she laughed, a little ruefully.<br> ‘Not being myself has always been my hardest trouble! As to where<br> I want to get, well, I guess I've gotten there. I wanted to be<br> rich and safe and--’<br><br> ‘But, Scarlett, did it ever occur to you that I don't care whether<br> I'm rich or not?’<br><br> No, it had never occurred to her that anyone would not want to be<br> rich.<br><br> ‘Then, what do you want?’<br><br> ‘I don't know, now. I knew once but I've half forgotten. Mostly<br> to be left alone, not to be harried by people I don't like, driven<br> to do things I don't want to do. Perhaps--I want the old days back<br> again and they'll never come back, and I am haunted by the memory<br> of them and of the world falling about my ears.’<br><br> Scarlett set her mouth obstinately. It was not that she did not<br> know what he meant. The very tones of his voice called up other<br> days as nothing else could, made her heart hurt suddenly, as she<br> too remembered. But since the day she had lain sick and desolate<br> in the garden at Twelve Oaks and said: ‘I won't look back,’ she<br> had set her face against the past.<br><br> ‘I like these days better,’ she said. But she did not meet his<br> eyes as she spoke. ‘There's always something exciting happening<br> now, parties and so on. Everything's got a glitter to it. The old<br> days were so dull.’ (Oh, lazy days and warm still country<br> twilights! The high soft laughter from the quarters! The golden<br> warmth life had then and the comforting knowledge of what all<br> tomorrows would bring! How can I deny you?)<br><br> ‘I like these days better,’ she said but her voice was tremulous.<br><br> He slipped from the table, laughing softly in unbelief. Putting<br> his hand under her chin, he turned her face up to his.<br><br> ‘Ah, Scarlett, what a poor liar you are! Yes, life has a glitter<br> now--of a sort. That's what's wrong with it. The old days had no<br> glitter but they had a charm, a beauty, a slow-paced glamour.’<br><br> Her mind pulled two ways, she dropped her eyes. The sound of his<br> voice, the touch of his hand were softly unlocking doors that she<br> had locked forever. Behind those doors lay the beauty of the old<br> days, and a sad hunger for them welled up within her. But she knew<br> that no matter what beauty lay behind, it must remain there. No<br> one could go forward with a load of aching memories.<br><br> His hand dropped from her chin and he took one of her hands between<br> his two and held it gently.<br><br> ‘Do you remember,’ he said--and a warning bell in her mind rang:<br> Don't look back! Don't look back!<br><br> But she swiftly disregarded it, swept forward on a tide of<br> happiness. At last she was understanding him, at last their minds<br> had met. This moment was too precious to be lost, no matter what<br> pain came after.<br><br> ‘Do you remember,’ he said and under the spell of his voice the<br> bare walls of the little office faded and the years rolled aside<br> and they were riding country bridle paths together in a long-gone<br> spring. As he spoke, his light grip tightened on her hand and in<br> his voice was the sad magic of old half-forgotten songs. She could<br> hear the gay jingle of bridle bits as they rode under the dogwood<br> trees to the Tarletons' picnic, hear her own careless laughter, see<br> the sun glinting on his silver-gilt hair and note the proud easy<br> grace with which he sat his horse. There was music in his voice,<br> the music of fiddles and banjos to which they had danced in the<br> white house that was no more. There was the far-off yelping of<br> possum dogs in the dark swamp under cool autumn moons and the smell<br> of eggnog bowls, wreathed with holly at Christmas time and smiles<br> on black and white faces. And old friends came trooping back,<br> laughing as though they had not been dead these many years: Stuart<br> and Brent with their long legs and their red hair and their<br> practical jokes, Tom and Boyd as wild as young horses, Joe Fontaine<br> with his hot black eyes, and Cade and Raiford Calvert who moved<br> with such languid grace. There was John Wilkes, too; and Gerald,<br> red with brandy; and a whisper and a fragrance that was Ellen.<br> Over it all rested a sense of security, a knowledge that tomorrow<br> could only bring the same happiness today had brought.<br><br> His voice stopped and they looked for a long quiet moment into each<br> other's eyes and between them lay the sunny lost youth that they<br> had so unthinkingly shared.<br><br> ‘Now I know why you can't be happy,’ she thought sadly. ‘I never<br> understood before. I never understood before why I wasn't<br> altogether happy either. But--why, we are talking like old people<br> talk!’ she thought with dreary surprise. ‘Old people looking back<br> fifty years. And we're not old! It's just that so much has<br> happened in between. Everything's changed so much that it seems<br> like fifty years ago. But we're not old!’<br><br> But when she looked at Ashley he was no longer young and shining.<br> His head was bowed as he looked down absently at her hand which he<br> still held and she saw that his once bright hair was very gray,<br> silver gray as moonlight on still water. Somehow the bright beauty<br> had gone from the April afternoon and from her heart as well and<br> the sad sweetness of remembering was as bitter as gall.<br><br> ‘I shouldn't have let him make me look back,’ she thought<br> despairingly. ‘I was right when I said I'd never look back. It<br> hurts too much, it drags at your heart till you can't ever do<br> anything else except look back. That's what's wrong with Ashley.<br> He can't look forward any more. He can't see the present, he fears<br> the future, and so he looks back. I never understood it before. I<br> never understood Ashley before. Oh, Ashley, my darling, you<br> shouldn't look back! What good will it do? I shouldn't have let<br> you tempt me into talking of the old days. This is what happens<br> when you look back to happiness, this pain, this heartbreak, this<br> discontent.’<br><br> She rose to her feet, her hand still in his. She must go. She<br> could not stay and think of the old days and see his face, tired<br> and sad and bleak as it now was.<br><br> ‘We've come a long way since those days, Ashley,’ she said, trying<br> to steady her voice, trying to fight the constriction in her<br> throat. ‘We had fine notions then, didn't we?’ And then, with a<br> rush, ‘Oh, Ashley, nothing has turned out as we expected!’<br><br> ‘It never does,’ he said. ‘Life's under no obligation to give us<br> what we expect. We take what we get and are thankful it's no worse<br> than it is.’<br><br> Her heart was suddenly dull with pain, with weariness, as she<br> thought of the long road she had come since those days. There rose<br> up in her mind the memory of Scarlett O'Hara who loved beaux and<br> pretty dresses and who intended, some day, when she had the time,<br> to be a great lady like Ellen.<br><br> Without warning, tears started in her eyes and rolled slowly down<br> her cheeks and she stood looking at him dumbly, like a hurt<br> bewildered child. He said no word but took her gently in his arms,<br> pressed her head against his shoulder and, leaning down, laid his<br> cheek against hers. She relaxed against him and her arms went<br> round his body. The comfort of his arms helped dry her sudden<br> tears. Ah, it was good to be in his arms, without passion, without<br> tenseness, to be there as a loved friend. Only Ashley who shared<br> her memories and her youth, who knew her beginnings and her present<br> could understand.<br><br> She heard the sound of feet outside but paid little heed, thinking<br> it was the teamsters going home. She stood for a moment, listening<br> to the slow beat of Ashley's heart. Then suddenly he wrenched<br> himself from her, confusing her by his violence. She looked up<br> into his face in surprise but he was not looking at her. He was<br> looking over her shoulder at the door.<br><br> She turned and there stood India, white faced, her pale eyes<br> blazing, and Archie, malevolent as a one-eyed parrot. Behind them<br> stood Mrs. Elsing.<br><br> <br><br> How she got out of the office she never remembered. But she went<br> instantly, swiftly, by Ashley's order, leaving Ashley and Archie in<br> grim converse in the little room and India and Mrs. Elsing outside<br> with their backs to her. Shame and fear sped her homeward and, in<br> her mind, Archie with his patriarch's beard assumed the proportions<br> of an avenging angel straight from the pages of the Old Testament.<br><br> The house was empty and still in the April sunset. All the<br> servants had gone to a funeral and the children were playing in<br> Melanie's back yard. Melanie--<br><br> Melanie! Scarlett went cold at the thought of her as she climbed<br> the stairs to her room. Melanie would hear of this. India had<br> said she would tell her. Oh, India would glory in telling her, not<br> caring if she blackened Ashley's name, not caring if she hurt<br> Melanie, if by so doing she could injure Scarlett! And Mrs. Elsing<br> would talk too, even though she had really seen nothing, because<br> she was behind India and Archie in the door of the lumber office.<br> But she would talk, just the same. The news would be all over town<br> by supper time. Everyone, even the negroes, would know by<br> tomorrow's breakfast. At the party tonight, women would gather in<br> corners and whisper discreetly and with malicious pleasure.<br> Scarlett Butler tumbled from her high and mighty place! And the<br> story would grow and grow. There was no way of stopping it. It<br> wouldn't stop at the bare facts, that Ashley was holding her in his<br> arms while she cried. Before nightfall people would be saying she<br> had been taken in adultery. And it had been so innocent, so sweet!<br> Scarlett thought wildly: If we had been caught that Christmas of<br> his furlough when I kissed him good-by--if we had been caught in<br> the orchard at Tara when I begged him to run away with me--oh, if<br> we'd been caught any of the times when we were really guilty, it<br> wouldn't be so bad! But now! Now! When I went to his arms as a<br> friend--<br><br> But no one would believe that. She wouldn't have a single friend<br> to take her part, not a single voice would be raised to say: ‘I<br> don't believe she was doing anything wrong.’ She had outraged old<br> friends too long to find a champion among them now. Her new<br> friends, suffering in silence under her insolences, would welcome a<br> chance to blackguard her. No, everybody would believe anything<br> about her, though they might regret that so fine a man as Ashley<br> Wilkes was mixed up in so dirty an affair. As usual they would<br> cast the blame upon the woman and shrug at the man's guilt. And in<br> this case they would be right. She had gone into his arms.<br><br> Oh, she could stand the cuts, the slights, the covert smiles,<br> anything the town might say, if she had to stand them--but not<br> Melanie! Oh, not Melanie! She did not know why she should mind<br> Melanie knowing, more than anyone else. She was too frightened and<br> weighed down by a sense of past guilt to try to understand it. But<br> she burst into tears at the thought of what would be in Melanie's<br> eyes when India told her that she had caught Ashley fondling<br> Scarlett. And what would Melanie do when she knew? Leave Ashley?<br> What else could she do, with any dignity? And what will Ashley and<br> I do then? she thought frenziedly, the tears streaming down her<br> face. Oh, Ashley will die of shame and hate me for bringing this<br> on him. Suddenly her tears stopped short as a deadly fear went<br> through her heart. What of Rhett? What would he do?<br><br> Perhaps he'd never know. What was that old saying, that cynical<br> saying? ‘The husband is always the last to find out.’ Perhaps no<br> one would tell him. It would take a brave man to break such news<br> to Rhett, for Rhett had the reputation for shooting first and<br> asking questions afterwards. Please, God, don't let anybody be<br> brave enough to tell him! But she remembered the face of Archie in<br> the lumber office, the cold, pale eye, remorseless, full of hate<br> for her and all women. Archie feared neither God nor man and he<br> hated loose women. He had hated them enough to kill one. And he<br> had said he would tell Rhett. And he'd tell him in spite of all<br> Ashley could do to dissuade him. Unless Ashley killed him, Archie<br> would tell Rhett, feeling it his Christian duty.<br><br> She pulled off her clothes and lay down on the bed, her mind<br> whirling round and round. If she could only lock her door and stay<br> in this safe place forever and ever and never see anyone again.<br> Perhaps Rhett wouldn't find out tonight. She'd say she had a<br> headache and didn't feel like going to the reception. By morning<br> she would have thought up some excuse to offer, some defense that<br> might hold water.<br><br> ‘I won't think of it now,’ she said desperately, burying her face<br> in the pillow. ‘I won't think of it now. I'll think of it later<br> when I can stand it.’<br><br> She heard the servants come back as night fell and it seemed to her<br> that they were very silent as they moved about preparing supper.<br> Or was it her guilty conscience? Mammy came to the door and<br> knocked but Scarlett sent her away, saying she did not want any<br> supper. Time passed and finally she heard Rhett coming up the<br> steps. She held herself tensely as he reached the upper hall,<br> gathered all her strength for a meeting but he passed into his<br> room. She breathed easier. He hadn't heard. Thank God, he still<br> respected her icy request that he never put foot in her bedroom<br> again, for if he saw her now, her face would give her away. She<br> must gather herself together enough to tell him that she felt too<br> ill to go to the reception. Well, there was time enough for her to<br> calm herself. Or was there time? Since the awful moment that<br> afternoon, life had seemed timeless. She heard Rhett moving about<br> in his room for a long time, speaking occasionally to Pork. Still<br> she could not find courage to call to him. She lay still on the<br> bed in the darkness, shaking.<br><br> After a long time, he knocked on her door and she said, trying to<br> control her voice: ‘Come in.’<br><br> ‘Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?’ he questioned,<br> opening the door. It was dark and she could not see his face. Nor<br> could she make anything of his voice. He entered and closed the<br> door.<br><br> ‘Are you ready for the reception?’<br><br> ‘I'm so sorry but I have a headache.’ How odd that her voice<br> sounded natural! Thank God for the dark! ‘I don't believe I'll<br> go. You go, Rhett, and give Melanie my regrets.’<br><br> There was a long pause and he spoke drawlingly, bitingly in the<br> dark.<br><br> ‘What a white livered, cowardly little bitch you are.’<br><br> He knew! She lay shaking, unable to speak. She heard him fumble<br> in the dark, strike a match and the room sprang into light. He<br> walked over to the bed and looked down at her. She saw that he was<br> in evening clothes.<br><br> ‘Get up,’ he said and there was nothing in his voice. ‘We are<br> going to the reception. You will have to hurry.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, I can't. You see--’<br><br> ‘I can see. Get up.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, did Archie dare--’<br><br> ‘Archie dared. A very brave man, Archie.’<br><br> ‘You should have killed him for telling lies--’<br><br> ‘I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth.<br> There's no time to argue now. Get up.’<br><br> She sat up, hugging her wrapper close to her, her eyes searching<br> his face. It was dark and impassive.<br><br> ‘I won't go, Rhett. I can't until this--misunderstanding is<br> cleared up.’<br><br> ‘If you don't show your face tonight, you'll never be able to show<br> it in this town as long as you live. And while I may endure a<br> trollop for a wife, I won't endure a coward. You are going<br> tonight, even if everyone, from Alex Stephens down, cuts you and<br> Mrs. Wilkes asks us to leave the house.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, let me explain.’<br><br> ‘I don't want to hear. There isn't time. Get on your clothes.’<br><br> ‘They misunderstood--India and Mrs. Elsing and Archie. And they<br> hate me so. India hates me so much that she'd even tell lies about<br> her own brother to make me appear in a bad light. If you'll only<br> let me explain--’<br><br> Oh, Mother of God, she thought in agony, suppose he says: ‘Pray do<br> explain!’ What can I say? How can I explain?<br><br> ‘They'll have told everybody lies. I can't go tonight.’<br><br> ‘You will go,’ he said, ‘if I have to drag you by the neck and<br> plant my boot on your ever so charming bottom every step of the<br> way.’<br><br> There was a cold glitter in his eyes as he jerked her to her feet.<br> He picked up her stays and threw them at her.<br><br> ‘Put them on. I'll lace you. Oh yes, I know all about lacing.<br> No, I won't call Mammy to help you and have you lock the door and<br> skulk here like the coward you are.’<br><br> ‘I'm not a coward,’ she cried, stung out of her fear. ‘I--’<br><br> ‘Oh, spare me your saga about shooting Yankees and facing Sherman's<br> army. You're a coward--among other things. If not for your own<br> sake, you are going tonight for Bonnie's sake. How could you<br> further ruin her chances? Put on your stays, quick.’<br><br> Hastily she slipped off her wrapper and stood clad only in her<br> chemise. If only he would look at her and see how nice she looked<br> in her chemise, perhaps that frightening look would leave his face.<br> After all, he hadn't seen her in her chemise for ever and ever so<br> long. But he did not look. He was in her closet, going through<br> her dresses swiftly. He fumbled and drew out her new jade-green<br> watered-silk dress. It was cut low over the bosom and the skirt<br> was draped back over an enormous bustle and on the bustle was a<br> huge bunch of pink velvet roses.<br><br> ‘Wear that,’ he said, tossing it on the bed and coming toward her.<br> ‘No modest, matronly dove grays and lilacs tonight. Your flag must<br> be nailed to the mast, for obviously you'd run it down if it<br> wasn't. And plenty of rouge. I'm sure the woman the Pharisees<br> took in adultery didn't look half so pale. Turn around.’<br><br> He took the strings of the stays in his hands and jerked them so<br> hard that she cried out, frightened, humiliated, embarrassed at<br> such an untoward performance.<br><br> ‘Hurts, does it?’ He laughed shortly and she could not see his<br> face. ‘Pity it isn't around your neck.’<br><br> Melanie's house blazed lights from every room and they could hear<br> the music far up the street. As they drew up in front, the<br> pleasant exciting sounds of many people enjoying themselves floated<br> out. The house was packed with guests. They overflowed on<br> verandas and many were sitting on benches in the dim lantern-hung<br> yard.<br><br> I can't go in--I can't, thought Scarlett, sitting in the carriage,<br> gripping her balled-up handkerchief. I can't. I won't. I will<br> jump out and run away, somewhere, back home to Tara. Why did Rhett<br> force me to come here? What will people do? What will Melanie do?<br> What will she look like? Oh, I can't face her. I will run away.<br><br> As though he read her mind, Rhett's hand closed upon her arm in a<br> grip that would leave a bruise, the rough grip of a careless<br> stranger.<br><br> ‘I've never known an Irishman to be a coward. Where's your much-<br> vaunted courage?’<br><br> ‘Rhett, do please, let me go home and explain.’<br><br> ‘You have eternity in which to explain and only one night to be a<br> martyr in the amphitheater. Get out, darling, and let me see the<br> lions eat you. Get out.’<br><br> She went up the walk somehow, the arm she was holding as hard and<br> steady as granite, communicating to her some courage. By God, she<br> could face them and she would. What were they but a bunch of<br> howling, clawing cats who were jealous of her? She'd show them.<br> She didn't care what they thought. Only Melanie--only Melanie.<br><br> They were on the porch and Rhett was bowing right and left, his hat<br> in his hand, his voice cool and soft. The music stopped as they<br> entered and the crowd of people seemed to her confused mind to<br> surge up to her like the roar of the sea and then ebb away, with<br> lessening, ever-lessening sound. Was everyone going to cut her?<br> Well, God's nightgown, let them do it! Her chin went up and she<br> smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling.<br><br> Before she could turn to speak to those nearest the door, someone<br> came through the press of people. There was an odd hush that<br> caught Scarlett's heart. Then through the lane came Melanie on<br> small feet that hurried, hurried to meet Scarlett at the door, to<br> speak to her before anyone else could speak. Her narrow shoulders<br> were squared and her small jaw set indignantly and, for all her<br> notice, she might have had no other guest but Scarlett. She went<br> to her side and slipped an arm about her waist.<br><br> ‘What a lovely dress, darling,’ she said in her small, clear voice.<br> ‘Will you be an angel? India was unable to come tonight and assist<br> me. Will you receive with me?’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LIV<br><br> <br> Safe in her room again, Scarlett fell on the bed, careless of her<br> moire dress, bustle and roses. For a time she could only lie still<br> and think of standing between Melanie and Ashley, greeting guests.<br> What a horror! She would face Sherman's army again rather than<br> repeat that performance! After a time, she rose from the bed and<br> nervously paced the floor, shedding garments as she walked.<br><br> Reaction from strain set in and she began to shake. Hairpins<br> slipped out of her fingers and tinkled to the floor and when she<br> tried to give her hair its customary hundred strokes, she banged<br> the back of the brush hurtingly against her temple. A dozen times<br> she tiptoed to the door to listen for noises downstairs but the<br> hall below lay like a black silent pit.<br><br> Rhett had sent her home alone in the carriage when the party was<br> over and she had thanked God for the reprieve. He had not come in<br> yet. Thank God, he had not come in. She could not face him<br> tonight, shamed, frightened, shaking. But where was he? Probably<br> at that creature's place. For the first time, Scarlett was glad<br> there was such a person as Belle Watling. Glad there was some<br> other place than this house to shelter Rhett until his glittering,<br> murderous mood had passed. That was wrong, being glad a husband<br> was at the house of a prostitute, but she could not help it. She<br> would be almost glad if he were dead, if it meant she would not<br> have to see him tonight.<br><br> Tomorrow--well, tomorrow was another day. Tomorrow she would think<br> of some excuse, some counter accusations, some way of putting Rhett<br> in the wrong. Tomorrow the memory of this hideous night would not<br> be driving her so fiercely that she shook. Tomorrow she would not<br> be so haunted by the memory of Ashley's face, his broken pride and<br> his shame--shame that she had caused, shame in which he had so<br> little part. Would he hate her now, her darling honorable Ashley,<br> because she had shamed him? Of course he would hate her now--now<br> that they had both been saved by the indignant squaring of<br> Melanie's thin shoulders and the love and outspoken trust which had<br> been in her voice as she crossed the glassy floor to slip her arm<br> through Scarlett's and face the curious, malicious, covertly<br> hostile crowd. How neatly Melanie had scotched the scandal,<br> keeping Scarlett at her side all through the dreadful evening!<br> People had been a bit cool, somewhat bewildered, but they had been<br> polite.<br><br> Oh, the ignominy of it all, to be sheltered behind Melanie's skirts<br> from those who hated her, who would have torn her to bits with<br> their whispers! To be sheltered by Melanie's blind trust, Melanie<br> of all people!<br><br> Scarlett shook as with a chill at the thought. She must have a<br> drink, a number of drinks before she could lie down and hope to<br> sleep. She threw a wrapper about her gown and went hastily out<br> into the dark hall, her backless slippers making a great clatter in<br> the stillness. She was halfway down the stairs before she looked<br> toward the closed door of the dining room and saw a narrow line of<br> light streaming from under it. Her heart stopped for a moment.<br> Had that light been burning when she came home and had she been too<br> upset to notice it? Or was Rhett home after all? He could have<br> come in quietly through the kitchen door. If Rhett were home, she<br> would tiptoe back to bed without her brandy, much as she needed it.<br> Then she wouldn't have to face him. Once in her room she would be<br> safe, for she could lock the door.<br><br> She was leaning over to pluck off her slippers, so she might hurry<br> back in silence, when the dining-room door swung open abruptly and<br> Rhett stood silhouetted against the dim candlelight behind him. He<br> looked huge, larger than she had ever seen him, a terrifying<br> faceless black bulk that swayed slightly on its feet.<br><br> ‘Pray join me, Mrs. Butler,’ he said and his voice was a little<br> thick.<br><br> He was drunk and showing it and she had never before seen him show<br> his liquor, no matter how much he drank. She paused irresolutely,<br> saying nothing and his arm went up in gesture of command.<br><br> ‘Come here, damn you!’ he said roughly.<br><br> He must be very drunk, she thought with a fluttering heart.<br> Usually, the more he drank, the more polished became his manners.<br> He sneered more, his words were apt to be more biting, but the<br> manner that accompanied them was always punctilious--too<br> punctilious.<br><br> ‘I must never let him know I'm afraid to face him,’ she thought,<br> and, clutching the wrapper closer to her throat, she went down the<br> stairs with her head up and her heels clacking noisily.<br><br> He stood aside and bowed her through the door with a mockery that<br> made her wince. She saw that he was coatless and his cravat hung<br> down on either side of his open collar. His shirt was open down to<br> the thick mat of black hair on his chest. His hair was rumpled and<br> his eyes bloodshot and narrow. One candle burned on the table, a<br> tiny spark of light that threw monstrous shadows about the high-<br> ceilinged room and made the massive sideboards and buffet look like<br> still, crouching beasts. On the table on the silver tray stood the<br> decanter with cut-glass stopper out, surrounded by glasses.<br><br> ‘Sit down,’ he said curtly, following her into the room.<br><br> Now a new kind of fear crept into her, a fear that made her alarm<br> at facing him seem very small. He looked and talked and acted like<br> a stranger. This was an ill-mannered Rhett she had never seen<br> before. Never at any time, even in most intimate moments, had he<br> been other than nonchalant. Even in anger, he was suave and<br> satirical, and whisky usually served to intensify these qualities.<br> At first it had annoyed her and she had tried to break down that<br> nonchalance but soon she had come to accept it as a very convenient<br> thing. For years she had thought that nothing mattered very much<br> to him, that he thought everything in life, including her, an<br> ironic joke. But as she faced him across the table, she knew with<br> a sinking feeling in her stomach that at last something was<br> mattering to him, mattering very much.<br><br> ‘There is no reason why you should not have your nightcap, even if<br> I am ill bred enough to be at home,’ he said. ‘Shall I pour it for<br> you?’<br><br> ‘I did not want a drink,’ she said stiffly. ‘I heard a noise and<br> came--’<br><br> ‘You heard nothing. You wouldn't have come down if you'd thought I<br> was home. I've sat here and listened to you racing up and down the<br> floor upstairs. You must need a drink badly. Take it.’<br><br> ‘I do not--’<br><br> He picked up the decanter and sloshed a glassful, untidily.<br><br> ‘Take it,’ he said, shoving it into her hand. ‘You are shaking all<br> over. Oh, don't give yourself airs. I know you drink on the quiet<br> and I know how much you drink. For some time I've been intending<br> to tell you to stop your elaborate pretenses and drink openly if<br> you want to. Do you think I give a damn if you like your brandy?’<br><br> She took the wet glass, silently cursing him. He read her like a<br> book. He had always read her and he was the one man in the world<br> from whom she would like to hide her real thoughts.<br><br> ‘Drink it, I say.’<br><br> She raised the glass and bolted the contents with one abrupt motion<br> of her arm, wrist stiff, just as Gerald had always taken his neat<br> whisky, bolted it before she thought how practiced and unbecoming<br> it looked. He did not miss the gesture and his mouth went down at<br> the corner.<br><br> ‘Sit down and we will have a pleasant domestic discussion of the<br> elegant reception we have just attended.’<br><br> ‘You are drunk,’ she said coldly, ‘and I am going to bed.’<br><br> ‘I am very drunk and I intend to get still drunker before the<br> evening's over. But you aren't going to bed--not yet. Sit down.’<br><br> His voice still held a remnant of its wonted cool drawl but beneath<br> the words she could feel violence fighting its way to the surface,<br> violence as cruel as the crack of a whip. She wavered irresolutely<br> and he was at her side, his hand on her arm in a grip that hurt.<br> He gave it a slight wrench and she hastily sat down with a little<br> cry of pain. Now, she was afraid, more afraid than she had ever<br> been in her life. As he leaned over her, she saw that his face was<br> dark and flushed and his eyes still held their frightening glitter.<br> There was something in their depths she did not recognize, could<br> not understand, something deeper than anger, stronger than pain,<br> something driving him until his eyes glowed redly like twin coals.<br> He looked down at her for a long time, so long that her defiant<br> gaze wavered and fell, and then he slumped into a chair opposite<br> her and poured himself another drink. She thought rapidly, trying<br> to lay a line of defenses. But until he spoke, she would not know<br> what to say for she did not know exactly what accusation he<br> intended to make.<br><br> He drank slowly, watching her over the glass and she tightened her<br> nerves, trying to keep from trembling. For a time his face did not<br> change its expression but finally he laughed, still keeping his<br> eyes on her, and at the sound she could not still her shaking.<br><br> ‘It was an amusing comedy, this evening, wasn't it?’<br><br> She said nothing, curling her toes in the loose slippers in an<br> effort at controlling her quivering.<br><br> ‘A pleasant comedy with no character missing. The village assembled<br> to stone the erring woman, the wronged husband supporting his wife<br> as a gentleman should, the wronged wife stepping in with Christian<br> spirit and casting the garments of her spotless reputation over it<br> all. And the lover--’<br><br> ‘Please.’<br><br> ‘I don't please. Not tonight. It's too amusing. And the lover<br> looking like a damned fool and wishing he were dead. How does it<br> feel, my dear, to have the woman you hate stand by you and cloak<br> your sins for you? Sit down.’<br><br> She sat down.<br><br> ‘You don't like her any better for it, I imagine. You are<br> wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley--wondering why she<br> did this if she does know--if she just did it to save her own face.<br> And you are thinking she's a fool for doing it, even if it did save<br> your hide but--’<br><br> ‘I will not listen--’<br><br> ‘Yes, you will listen. And I'll tell you this to ease your worry.<br> Miss Melly is a fool but not the kind you think. It was obvious<br> that someone had told her but she didn't believe it. Even if she<br> saw, she wouldn't believe. There's too much honor in her to<br> conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves. I don't know what lie<br> Ashley Wilkes told her--but any clumsy one would do, for she loves<br> Ashley and she loves you. I'm sure I can't see why she loves you<br> but she does. Let that be one of your crosses.’<br><br> ‘If you were not so drunk and insulting, I would explain<br> everything,’ said Scarlett, recovering some dignity. ‘But now--’<br><br> ‘I am not interested in your explanations. I know the truth better<br> than you do. By God, if you get up out of that chair just once<br> more--<br><br> ‘And what I find more amusing than even tonight's comedy is the<br> fact that while you have been so virtuously denying me the<br> pleasures of your bed because of my many sins, you have been<br> lusting in your heart after Ashley Wilkes. 'Lusting in your<br> heart.' That's a good phrase, isn't it? There are a number of<br> good phrases in that Book, aren't there?’<br><br> ‘What book? What book?’ her mind ran on, foolishly, irrelevantly<br> as she cast frantic eyes about the room, noting how dully the<br> massive silver gleamed in the dim light, how frighteningly dark the<br> corners were.<br><br> ‘And I was cast out because my coarse ardors were too much for your<br> refinement--because you didn't want any more children. How bad<br> that made me feel, dear heart! How it cut me! So I went out and<br> found pleasant consolation and left you to your refinements. And<br> you spent that time tracking the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes. God<br> damn him, what ails him? He can't be faithful to his wife with his<br> mind or unfaithful with his body. Why doesn't he make up his mind?<br> You wouldn't object to having his children, would you--and passing<br> them off as mine?’<br><br> She sprang to her feet with a cry and he lunged from his seat,<br> laughing that soft laugh that made her blood cold. He pressed her<br> back into her chair with large brown hands and leaned over her.<br><br> ‘Observe my hands, my dear,’ he said, flexing them before her eyes.<br> ‘I could tear you to pieces with them with no trouble whatsoever<br> and I would do it if it would take Ashley out of your mind. But it<br> wouldn't. So I think I'll remove him from your mind forever, this<br> way. I'll put my hands, so, on each side of your head and I'll<br> smash your skull between them like a walnut and that will blot him<br> out.’<br><br> His hands were on her head, under her flowing hair, caressing,<br> hard, turning her face up to his. She was looking into the face of<br> a stranger, a drunken drawling-voiced stranger. She had never<br> lacked animal courage and in the face of danger it flooded back<br> hotly into her veins, stiffening her spine, narrowing her eyes.<br><br> ‘You drunken fool,’ she said. ‘Take your hands off me.’<br><br> To her surprise, he did so and seating himself on the edge of the<br> table he poured himself another drink.<br><br> ‘I have always admired your spirit, my dear. Never more than now<br> when you are cornered.’<br><br> She drew her wrapper close about her body. Oh, if she could only<br> reach her room and turn the key in the stout door and be alone.<br> Somehow, she must stand him off, bully him into submission, this<br> Rhett she had never seen before. She rose without haste, though<br> her knees shook, tightened the wrapper across her hips and threw<br> back her hair from her face.<br><br> ‘I'm not cornered,’ she said cuttingly. ‘You'll never corner me,<br> Rhett Butler, or frighten me. You are nothing but a drunken beast<br> who's been with bad women so long that you can't understand<br> anything else but badness. You can't understand Ashley or me.<br> You've lived in dirt too long to know anything else. You are<br> jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.’<br><br> She turned casually and started toward the door and a burst of<br> laughter stopped her. She turned and he swayed across the room<br> toward her. Name of God, if he would only stop that terrible<br> laugh! What was there to laugh about in all of this? As he came<br> toward her, she backed toward the door and found herself against<br> the wall. He put his hands heavily upon her and pinned her<br> shoulders to the wall.<br><br> ‘Stop laughing.’<br><br> ‘I am laughing because I am so sorry for you.’<br><br> ‘Sorry--for me? Be sorry for yourself.’<br><br> ‘Yes, by God, I'm sorry for you, my dear, my pretty little fool.<br> That hurts, doesn't it? You can't stand either laughter or pity,<br> can you?’<br><br> He stopped laughing, leaning so heavily against her shoulders that<br> they ached. His face changed and he leaned so close to her that<br> the heavy whisky smell of his breath made her turn her head.<br><br> ‘Jealous, am I?’ he said. ‘And why not? Oh, yes, I'm jealous of<br> Ashley Wilkes. Why not? Oh, don't try to talk and explain. I<br> know you've been physically faithful to me. Was that what you were<br> trying to say? Oh, I've known that all along. All these years.<br> How do I know? Oh, well, I know Ashley Wilkes and his breed. I<br> know he is honorable and a gentleman. And that, my dear, is more<br> than I can say for you--or for me, for that matter. We are not<br> gentlemen and we have no honor, have we? That's why we flourish<br> like green bay trees.’<br><br> ‘Let me go. I won't stand here and be insulted.’<br><br> ‘I'm not insulting you. I'm praising your physical virtue. And it<br> hasn't fooled me one bit. You think men are such fools, Scarlett.<br> It never pays to underestimate your opponent's strength and<br> intelligence. And I'm not a fool. Don't you suppose I know that<br> you've lain in my arms and pretended I was Ashley Wilkes?’<br><br> Her jaw dropped and fear and astonishment were written plainly in<br> her face.<br><br> ‘Pleasant thing, that. Rather ghostly, in fact. Like having three<br> in a bed where there ought to be just two.’ He shook her<br> shoulders, ever so slightly, hiccoughed and smiled mockingly.<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, you've been faithful to me because Ashley wouldn't have<br> you. But, hell, I wouldn't have grudged him your body. I know how<br> little bodies mean--especially women's bodies. But I do grudge him<br> your heart and your dear, hard, unscrupulous, stubborn mind. He<br> doesn't want your mind, the fool, and I don't want your body. I<br> can buy women cheap. But I do want your mind and your heart, and<br> I'll never have them, any more than you'll ever have Ashley's mind.<br> And that's why I'm sorry for you.’<br><br> Even through her fear and bewilderment, his sneer stung.<br><br> ‘Sorry--for me?’<br><br> ‘Yes, sorry because you're such a child, Scarlett. A child crying<br> for the moon. What would a child do with the moon if it got it?<br> And what would you do with Ashley? Yes, I'm sorry for you--sorry<br> to see you throwing away happiness with both hands and reaching out<br> for something that would never make you happy. I'm sorry because<br> you are such a fool you don't know there can't ever be happiness<br> except when like mates like. If I were dead, if Miss Melly were<br> dead and you had your precious honorable lover, do you think you'd<br> be happy with him? Hell, no! You would never know him, never know<br> what he was thinking about, never understand him any more than you<br> understand music and poetry and books or anything that isn't<br> dollars and cents. Whereas, we, dear wife of my bosom, could have<br> been perfectly happy if you had ever given us half a chance, for we<br> are so much alike. We are both scoundrels, Scarlett, and nothing<br> is beyond us when we want something. We could have been happy, for<br> I loved you and I know you, Scarlett, down to your bones, in a way<br> that Ashley could never know you. And he would despise you if he<br> did know. . . . But no, you must go mooning all your life after a<br> man you cannot understand. And I, my darling, will continue to<br> moon after whores. And, I dare say we'll do better than most<br> couples.’<br><br> He released her abruptly and made a weaving way back toward the<br> decanter. For a moment, Scarlett stood rooted, thoughts tearing in<br> and out of her mind so swiftly that she could seize none of them<br> long enough to examine them. Rhett had said he loved her. Did he<br> mean it? Or was he merely drunk? Or was this one of his horrible<br> jokes? And Ashley--the moon--crying for the moon. She ran swiftly<br> into the dark hall, fleeing as though demons were upon her. Oh, if<br> she could only reach her room! She turned her ankle and the slipper<br> fell half off. As she stopped to kick it loose frantically, Rhett,<br> running lightly as an Indian, was beside her in the dark. His<br> breath was not on her face and his hands went round her roughly,<br> under the wrapper, against her bare skin.<br><br> ‘You turned me out on the town while you chased him. By God, this<br> is one night when there are only going to be two in my bed.’<br><br> He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs.<br> Her head was crushed against his chest and she heard the hard<br> hammering of his heart beneath her ears. He hurt her and she cried<br> out, muffled, frightened. Up the stairs he went in the utter<br> darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear. He was a mad<br> stranger and this was a black darkness she did not know, darker<br> than death. He was like death, carrying her away in arms that<br> hurt. She screamed, stifled against him and he stopped suddenly on<br> the landing and, turning her swiftly in his arms, bent over and<br> kissed her with a savagery and a completeness that wiped out<br> everything from her mind but the dark into which she was sinking<br> and the lips on hers. He was shaking, as though he stood in a<br> strong wind, and his lips, traveling from her mouth downward to<br> where the wrapper had fallen from her body, fell on her soft flesh.<br> He was muttering things she did not hear, his lips were evoking<br> feelings never felt before. She was darkness and he was darkness<br> and there had never been anything before this time, only darkness<br> and his lips upon her. She tried to speak and his mouth was over<br> hers again. Suddenly she had a wild thrill such as she had never<br> known; joy, fear, madness, excitement, surrender to arms that were<br> too strong, lips too bruising, fate that moved too fast. For the<br> first time in her life she had met someone, something stronger than<br> she, someone she could neither bully nor break, someone who was<br> bullying and breaking her. Somehow, her arms were around his neck<br> and her lips trembling beneath his and they were going up, up into<br> the darkness again, a darkness that was soft and swirling and all<br> enveloping.<br><br> <br><br> When she awoke the next morning, he was gone and had it not been<br> for the rumpled pillow beside her, she would have thought the<br> happenings of the night before a wild preposterous dream. She went<br> crimson at the memory and, pulling the bed covers up about her<br> neck, lay bathed in sunlight, trying to sort out the jumbled<br> impressions in her mind.<br><br> Two things stood to the fore. She had lived for years with Rhett,<br> slept with him, eaten with him, quarreled with him and borne his<br> child--and yet, she did not know him. The man who had carried her<br> up the dark stairs was a stranger of whose existence she had not<br> dreamed. And now, though she tried to make herself hate him, tried<br> to be indignant, she could not. He had humbled her, hurt her, used<br> her brutally through a wild mad night and she had gloried in it.<br><br> Oh, she should be ashamed, should shrink from the very memory of<br> the hot swirling darkness! A lady, a real lady, could never hold<br> up her head after such a night. But, stronger than shame, was the<br> memory of rapture, of the ecstasy of surrender. For the first time<br> in her life she had felt alive, felt passion as sweeping and<br> primitive as the fear she had known the night she fled Atlanta, as<br> dizzy sweet as the cold hate when she had shot the Yankee.<br><br> Rhett loved her! At least, he said he loved her and how could she<br> doubt it now? How odd and bewildering and how incredible that he<br> loved her, this savage stranger with whom she had lived in such<br> coolness. She was not altogether certain how she felt about this<br> revelation but as an idea came to her she suddenly laughed aloud.<br> He loved her and so she had him at last. She had almost forgotten<br> her early desire to entrap him into loving her, so she could hold<br> the whip over his insolent black head. Now, it came back and it<br> gave her great satisfaction. For one night, he had had her at his<br> mercy but now she knew the weakness of his armor. From now on she<br> had him where she wanted him. She had smarted under his jeers for<br> a long time, but now she had him where she could make him jump<br> through any hoops she cared to hold.<br><br> When she thought of meeting him again, face to face in the sober<br> light of day, a nervous tingling embarrassment that carried with it<br> an exciting pleasure enveloped her.<br><br> ‘I'm nervous as a bride,’ she thought. ‘And about Rhett!’ And, at<br> the idea she fell to giggling foolishly.<br><br> But Rhett did not appear for dinner, nor was he at his place at the<br> supper table. The night passed, a long night during which she lay<br> awake until dawn, her ears strained to hear his key in the latch.<br> But he did not come. When the second day passed with no word from<br> him, she was frantic with disappointment and fear. She went by the<br> bank but he was not there. She went to the store and was very<br> sharp with everyone, for every time the door opened to admit a<br> customer she looked up with a flutter, hoping it was Rhett. She<br> went to the lumber yard and bullied Hugh until he hid himself<br> behind a pile of lumber. But Rhett did not seek her there.<br><br> She could not humble herself to ask friends if they had seen him.<br> She could not make inquiries among the servants for news of him.<br> But she felt they knew something she did not know. Negroes always<br> knew everything. Mammy was unusually silent those two days. She<br> watched Scarlett out of the corner of her eye and said nothing.<br> When the second night had passed Scarlett made up her mind to go to<br> the police. Perhaps he had had an accident, perhaps his horse had<br> thrown him and he was lying helpless in some ditch. Perhaps--oh,<br> horrible thought--perhaps he was dead.<br><br> The next morning when she had finished her breakfast and was in her<br> room putting on her bonnet, she heard swift feet on the stairs. As<br> she sank to the bed in weak thankfulness, Rhett entered the room.<br> He was freshly barbered, shaved and massaged and he was sober, but<br> his eyes were bloodshot and his face puffy from drink. He waved an<br> airy hand at her and said: ‘Oh, hello.’<br><br> How could a man say ‘Oh, hello,’ after being gone without<br> explanation for two days? How could he be so nonchalant with the<br> memory of such a night as they had spent? He couldn't unless--<br> unless--the terrible thought leaped into her mind. Unless such<br> nights were the usual thing to him. For a moment she could not<br> speak and all the pretty gestures and smiles she had thought to use<br> upon him were forgotten. He did not even come to her to give her<br> his usual offhand kiss but stood looking at her, with a grin, a<br> smoking cigar in his hand.<br><br> ‘Where--where have you been?’<br><br> ‘Don't tell me you don't know! I thought surely the whole town<br> knew by now. Perhaps they all do, except you. You know the old<br> adage: 'The wife is always the last one to find out.'‘<br><br> ‘What do you mean?’<br><br> ‘I thought that after the police called at Belle's night before<br> last--’<br><br> ‘Belle's--that--that woman! You have been with--’<br><br> ‘Of course. Where else would I be? I hope you haven't worried<br> about me.’<br><br> ‘You went from me to--oh!’<br><br> ‘Come, come, Scarlett! Don't play the deceived wife. You must<br> have known about Belle long ago.’<br><br> ‘You went to her from me, after--after--’<br><br> ‘Oh, that.’ He made a careless gesture. ‘I will forget my<br> manners. My apologies for my conduct at our last meeting. I was<br> very drunk, as you doubtless know, and quite swept off my feet by<br> your charms--need I enumerate them?’<br><br> Suddenly she wanted to cry, to lie down on the bed and sob<br> endlessly. He hadn't changed, nothing had changed, and she had<br> been a fool, a stupid, conceited, silly fool, thinking he loved<br> her. It had all been one of his repulsive drunken jests. He had<br> taken her and used her when he was drunk, just as he would use any<br> woman in Belle's house. And now he was back, insulting, sardonic,<br> out of reach. She swallowed her tears and rallied. He must never,<br> never know what she had thought. How he would laugh if he knew!<br> Well, he'd never know. She looked up quickly at him and caught<br> that old, puzzling, watchful glint in his eyes--keen, eager as<br> though he hung on her next words, hoping they would be--what was he<br> hoping? That she'd make a fool out of herself and bawl and give<br> him something to laugh about? Not she! Her slanting brows rushed<br> together in a cold frown.<br><br> ‘I had naturally suspected what your relations with that creature<br> were.’<br><br> ‘Only suspected? Why didn't you ask me and satisfy your curiosity?<br> I'd have told you. I've been living with her ever since the day<br> you and Ashley Wilkes decided that we should have separate<br> bedrooms.’<br><br> ‘You have the gall to stand there and boast to me, your wife, that--’<br><br> ‘Oh, spare me your moral indignation. You never gave a damn what I<br> did as long as I paid the bills. And you know I've been no angel<br> recently. And as for you being my wife--you haven't been much of a<br> wife since Bonnie came, have you? You've been a poor investment,<br> Scarlett. Belle's been a better one.’<br><br> ‘Investment? You mean you gave her--?’<br><br> ‘'Set her up in business' is the correct term, I believe. Belle's<br> a smart woman. I wanted to see her get ahead and all she needed<br> was money to start a house of her own. You ought to know what<br> miracles a woman can perform when she has a bit of cash. Look at<br> yourself.’<br><br> ‘You compare me--’<br><br> ‘Well, you are both hard-headed business women and both successful.<br> Belle's got the edge on you, of course, because she's a kind-<br> hearted, good-natured soul--’<br><br> ‘Will you get out of this room?’<br><br> He lounged toward the door, one eyebrow raised quizzically. How<br> could he insult her so, she thought in rage and pain. He was going<br> out of his way to hurt and humiliate her and she writhed as she<br> thought how she had longed for his homecoming, while all the time<br> he was drunk and brawling with police in a bawdy house.<br><br> ‘Get out of this room and don't ever come back in it. I told you<br> that once before and you weren't enough of a gentleman to<br> understand. Hereafter I will lock my door.’<br><br> ‘Don't bother.’<br><br> ‘I will lock it. After the way you acted the other night--so<br> drunk, so disgusting--’<br><br> ‘Come now, darling! Not disgusting, surely!’<br><br> ‘Get out.’<br><br> ‘Don't worry. I'm going. And I promise I'll never bother you<br> again. That's final. And I just thought I'd tell you that if my<br> infamous conduct was too much for you to bear, I'll let you have a<br> divorce. Just give me Bonnie and I won't contest it.’<br><br> ‘I would not think of disgracing the family with a divorce.’<br><br> ‘You'd disgrace it quick enough if Miss Melly was dead, wouldn't<br> you? It makes my head spin to think how quickly you'd divorce me.’<br><br> ‘Will you go?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I'm going. That's what I came home to tell you. I'm going<br> to Charleston and New Orleans and--oh, well, a very extended trip.<br> I'm leaving today.’<br><br> ‘Oh!’<br><br> ‘And I'm taking Bonnie with me. Get that foolish Prissy to pack<br> her little duds. I'll take Prissy too.’<br><br> ‘You'll never take my child out of this house.’<br><br> ‘My child too, Mrs. Butler. Surely you do not mind me taking her<br> to Charleston to see her grandmother?’<br><br> ‘Her grandmother, my foot! Do you think I'll let you take that<br> baby out of here when you'll be drunk every night and most likely<br> taking her to houses like that Belle's--’<br><br> He threw down the cigar violently and it smoked acridly on the<br> carpet, the smell of scorching wool rising to their nostrils. In<br> an instant he was across the floor and by her side, his face black<br> with fury.<br><br> ‘If you were a man, I would break your neck for that. As it is,<br> all I can say is for you to shut your God-damn mouth. Do you think<br> I do not love Bonnie, that I would take her where--my daughter!<br> Good God, you fool! And as for you, giving yourself pious airs<br> about your motherhood, why, a cat's a better mother than you! What<br> have you ever done for the children? Wade and Ella are frightened<br> to death of you and if it wasn't for Melanie Wilkes, they'd never<br> know what love and affection are. But Bonnie, my Bonnie! Do you<br> think I can't take better care of her than you? Do you think I'll<br> ever let you bully her and break her spirit, as you've broken<br> Wade's and Ella's? Hell, no! Have her packed up and ready for me<br> in an hour or I warn you what happened the other night will be mild<br> beside what will happen. I've always thought a good lashing with a<br> buggy whip would benefit you immensely.’<br><br> He turned on his heel before she could speak and went out of the<br> room on swift feet. She heard him cross the floor of the hall to<br> the children's play room and open the door. There was a glad,<br> quick treble of childish voices and she heard Bonnie's tones rise<br> over Ella's.<br><br> ‘Daddy, where you been?’<br><br> ‘Hunting for a rabbit's skin to wrap my little Bonnie in. Give<br> your best sweetheart a kiss, Bonnie--and you too, Ella.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LV<br><br> <br> ‘Darling, I don't want any explanation from you and I won't listen<br> to one,’ said Melanie firmly as she gently laid a small hand across<br> Scarlett's tortured lips and stilled her words. ‘You insult<br> yourself and Ashley and me by even thinking there could be need of<br> explanations between us. Why, we three have been--have been like<br> soldiers fighting the world together for so many years that I'm<br> ashamed of you for thinking idle gossip could come between us. Do<br> you think I'd believe that you and my Ashley-- Why, the idea!<br> Don't you realize I know you better than anyone in the world knows<br> you? Do you think I've forgotten all the wonderful, unselfish<br> things you've done for Ashley and Beau and me--everything from<br> saving my life to keeping us from starving! Do you think I could<br> remember you walking in a furrow behind that Yankee's horse almost<br> barefooted and with your hands blistered--just so the baby and I<br> could have something to eat--and then believe such dreadful things<br> about you? I don't want to hear a word out of you, Scarlett<br> O'Hara. Not a word.’<br><br> ‘But--’ Scarlett fumbled and stopped.<br><br> Rhett had left town the hour before with Bonnie and Prissy, and<br> desolation was added to Scarlett's shame and anger. The additional<br> burden of her guilt with Ashley and Melanie's defense was more than<br> she could bear. Had Melanie believed India and Archie, cut her at<br> the reception or even greeted her frigidly, then she could have<br> held her head high and fought back with every weapon in her armory.<br> But now, with the memory of Melanie standing between her and social<br> ruin, standing like a thin, shining blade, with trust and a<br> fighting light in her eyes, there seemed nothing honest to do but<br> confess. Yes, blurt out everything from that far-off beginning on<br> the sunny porch at Tara.<br><br> She was driven by a conscience which, though long suppressed, could<br> still rise up, an active Catholic conscience. ‘Confess your sins<br> and do penance for them in sorrow and contrition,’ Ellen had told<br> her a hundred times and, in this crisis, Ellen's religious training<br> came back and gripped her. She would confess--yes, everything,<br> every look and word, those few caresses--and then God would ease<br> her pain and give her peace. And, for her penance, there would be<br> the dreadful sight of Melanie's face changing from fond love and<br> trust to incredulous horror and repulsion. Oh, that was too hard a<br> penance, she thought in anguish, to have to live out her life<br> remembering Melanie's face, knowing that Melanie knew all the<br> pettiness, the meanness, the two-faced disloyalty and the hypocrisy<br> that were in her.<br><br> Once, the thought of flinging the truth tauntingly in Melanie's<br> face and seeing the collapse of her fool's paradise had been an<br> intoxicating one, a gesture worth everything she might lose<br> thereby. But now, all that had changed overnight and there was<br> nothing she desired less. Why this should be she did not know.<br> There was too great a tumult of conflicting ideas in her mind for<br> her to sort them out. She only knew that as she had once desired<br> to keep her mother thinking her modest, kind, pure of heart, so she<br> now passionately desired to keep Melanie's high opinion. She only<br> knew that she did not care what the world thought of her or what<br> Ashley or Rhett thought of her, but Melanie must not think her<br> other than she had always thought her.<br><br> She dreaded to tell Melanie the truth but one of her rare honest<br> instincts arose, an instinct that would not let her masquerade in<br> false colors before the woman who had fought her battles for her.<br> So she had hurried to Melanie that morning, as soon as Rhett and<br> Bonnie had left the house.<br><br> But at her first tumbled-out words: ‘Melly, I must explain about<br> the other day--’ Melanie had imperiously stopped her. Scarlett<br> looking shamefaced into the dark eyes that were flashing with love<br> and anger, knew with a sinking heart that the peace and calm<br> following confession could never be hers. Melanie had forever cut<br> off that line of action by her first words. With one of the few<br> adult emotions Scarlett had ever had, she realized that to unburden<br> her own tortured heart would be the purest selfishness. She would<br> be ridding herself of her burden and laying it on the heart of an<br> innocent and trusting person. She owed Melanie a debt for her<br> championship and that debt could only be paid with silence. What<br> cruel payment it would be to wreck Melanie's life with the<br> unwelcome knowledge that her husband was unfaithful to her, and her<br> beloved friend a party to it!<br><br> ‘I can't tell her,’ she thought miserably. ‘Never, not even if my<br> conscience kills me.’ She remembered irrelevantly Rhett's drunken<br> remark: ‘She can't conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves . . .<br> let that be your cross.’<br><br> Yes, it would be her cross, until she died, to keep this torment<br> silent within her, to wear the hair shirt of shame, to feel it<br> chafing her at every tender look and gesture Melanie would make<br> throughout the years, to subdue forever the impulse to cry: ‘Don't<br> be so kind! Don't fight for me! I'm not worth it!’<br><br> ‘If you only weren't such a fool, such a sweet, trusting, simple-<br> minded fool, it wouldn't be so hard,’ she thought desperately.<br> ‘I've toted lots of weary loads but this is going to be the<br> heaviest and most galling load I've ever toted.’<br><br> Melanie sat facing her, in a low chair, her feet firmly planted on<br> an ottoman so high that her knees stuck up like a child's, a<br> posture she would never have assumed had not rage possessed her to<br> the point of forgetting proprieties. She held a line of tatting in<br> her hands and she was driving the shining needle back and forth as<br> furiously as though handling a rapier in a duel.<br><br> Had Scarlett been possessed of such an anger, she would have been<br> stamping both feet and roaring like Gerald in his finest days,<br> calling on God to witness the accursed duplicity and knavishness of<br> mankind and uttering blood-curdling threats of retaliation. But<br> only by the flashing needle and the delicate brows drawn down<br> toward her nose did Melanie indicate that she was inwardly<br> seething. Her voice was cool and her words were more close clipped<br> than usual. But the forceful words she uttered were foreign to<br> Melanie who seldom voiced an opinion at all and never an unkind<br> word. Scarlett realized suddenly that the Wilkeses and the<br> Hamiltons were capable of furies equal to and surpassing those of<br> the O'Haras.<br><br> ‘I've gotten mighty tired of hearing people criticize you,<br> darling,’ Melanie said, ‘and this is the last straw and I'm going<br> to do something about it. All this has happened because people are<br> jealous of you, because you are so smart and successful. You've<br> succeeded where lots of men, even, have failed. Now, don't be<br> vexed with me, dear, for saying that. I don't mean you've ever<br> been unwomanly or unsexed yourself, as lots of folks have said.<br> Because you haven't. People just don't understand you and people<br> can't bear for women to be smart. But your smartness and your<br> success don't give people the right to say that you and Ashley--<br> Stars above!’<br><br> The soft vehemence of this last ejaculation would have been, upon a<br> man's lips, profanity of no uncertain meaning. Scarlett stared at<br> her, alarmed by so unprecedented an outburst.<br><br> ‘And for them to come to me with the filthy lies they'd concocted--<br> Archie, India, Mrs. Elsing! How did they dare? Of course, Mrs.<br> Elsing didn't come here. No, indeed, she didn't have the courage.<br> But she's always hated you, darling, because you were more popular<br> than Fanny. And she was so incensed at your demoting Hugh from the<br> management of the mill. But you were quite right in demoting him.<br> He's just a piddling, do-less, good-for-nothing!’ Swiftly Melanie<br> dismissed the playmate of her childhood and the beau of her teen<br> years. ‘I blame myself about Archie. I shouldn't have given the<br> old scoundrel shelter. Everyone told me so but I wouldn't listen.<br> He didn't like you, dear, because of the convicts, but who is he to<br> criticize you? A murderer, and the murderer of a woman, too! And<br> after all I've done for him, he comes to me and tells me-- I<br> shouldn't have been a bit sorry if Ashley had shot him. Well, I<br> packed him off with a large flea in his ear, I can tell you! And<br> he's left town.<br><br> ‘And as for India, the vile thing! Darling, I couldn't help<br> noticing from the first time I saw you two together that she was<br> jealous of you and hated you, because you were so much prettier and<br> had so many beaux. And she hated you especially about Stuart<br> Tarleton. And she's brooded about Stuart so much that--well, I<br> hate to say it about Ashley's sister but I think her mind has<br> broken with thinking so much! There's no other explanation for her<br> action. . . . I told her never to put foot in this house again and<br> that if I heard her breathe so vile an insinuation I would--I would<br> call her a liar in public!’<br><br> Melanie stopped speaking and abruptly the anger left her face and<br> sorrow swamped it. Melanie had all that passionate clan loyalty<br> peculiar to Georgians and the thought of a family quarrel tore her<br> heart. She faltered for a moment. But Scarlett was dearest,<br> Scarlett came first in her heart, and she went on loyally:<br><br> ‘She's always been jealous because I loved you best, dear. She'll<br> never come in this house again and I'll never put foot under any<br> roof that receives her. Ashley agrees with me, but it's just about<br> broken his heart that his own sister should tell such a--’<br><br> At the mention of Ashley's name, Scarlett's overwrought nerves gave<br> way and she burst into tears. Would she never stop stabbing him to<br> the heart? Her only thought had been to make him happy and safe<br> but at every turn she seemed to hurt him. She had wrecked his<br> life, broken his pride and self-respect, shattered that inner<br> peace, that calm based on integrity. And now she had alienated him<br> from the sister he loved so dearly. To save her own reputation and<br> his wife's happiness, India had to be sacrificed, forced into the<br> light of a lying, half-crazed, jealous old maid--India who was<br> absolutely justified in every suspicion she had ever harbored and<br> every accusing word she had uttered. Whenever Ashley looked into<br> India's eyes, he would see the truth shining there, truth and<br> reproach and the cold contempt of which the Wilkeses were masters.<br><br> Knowing how Ashley valued honor above his life, Scarlett knew he<br> must be writhing. He, like Scarlett, was forced to shelter behind<br> Melanie's skirts. While Scarlett realized the necessity for this<br> and knew that the blame for his false position lay mostly at her<br> own door, still--still-- Womanlike she would have respected Ashley<br> more, had he shot Archie and admitted everything to Melanie and the<br> world. She knew she was being unfair but she was too miserable to<br> care for such fine points. Some of Rhett's taunting words of<br> contempt came back to her and she wondered if indeed Ashley had<br> played the manly part in this mess. And, for the first time, some<br> of the bright glow which had enveloped him since the first day she<br> fell in love with him began to fade imperceptibly. The tarnish of<br> shame and guilt that enveloped her spread to him as well.<br> Resolutely she tried to fight off this thought but it only made her<br> cry harder.<br><br> ‘Don't! Don't!’ cried Melanie, dropping her tatting and flinging<br> herself onto the sofa and drawing Scarlett's head down onto her<br> shoulder. ‘I shouldn't have talked about it all and distressed you<br> so. I know how dreadfully you must feel and we'll never mention it<br> again. No, not to each other or to anybody. It'll be as though it<br> never happened. But,’ she added with quiet venom, ‘I'm going to<br> show India and Mrs. Elsing what's what. They needn't think they<br> can spread lies about my husband and my sister-in-law. I'm going<br> to fix it so neither of them can hold up their heads in Atlanta.<br> And anybody who believes them or receives them is my enemy.’<br><br> Scarlett, looking sorrowfully down the long vista of years to come,<br> knew that she was the cause of a feud that would split the town and<br> the family for generations.<br><br> <br><br> Melanie was as good as her word. She never again mentioned the<br> subject to Scarlett or to Ashley. Nor, for that matter, would she<br> discuss it with anyone. She maintained an air of cool indifference<br> that could speedily change to icy formality if anyone even dared<br> hint about the matter. During the weeks that followed her surprise<br> party, while Rhett was mysteriously absent and the town in a<br> frenzied state of gossip, excitement and partisanship, she gave no<br> quarter to Scarlett's detractors, whether they were her old friends<br> or her blood kin. She did not speak, she acted.<br><br> She stuck by Scarlett's side like a cocklebur. She made Scarlett<br> go to the store and the lumber yard, as usual, every morning and<br> she went with her. She insisted that Scarlett go driving in the<br> afternoons, little though Scarlett wished to expose herself to the<br> eager curious gaze of her fellow townspeople. And Melanie sat in<br> the carriage beside her. Melanie took her calling with her on<br> formal afternoons, gently forcing her into parlors in which<br> Scarlett had not sat for more than two years. And Melanie, with a<br> fierce ‘love-me-love-my-dog’ look on her face, made converse with<br> astounded hostesses.<br><br> She made Scarlett arrive early on these afternoons and remain until<br> the last callers had gone, thereby depriving the ladies of the<br> opportunity for enjoyable group discussion and speculation, a<br> matter which caused some mild indignation. These calls were an<br> especial torment to Scarlett but she dared not refuse to go with<br> Melanie. She hated to sit amid crowds of women who were secretly<br> wondering if she had been actually taken in adultery. She hated<br> the knowledge that these women would not have spoken to her, had it<br> not been that they loved Melanie and did not want to lose her<br> friendship. But Scarlett knew that, having once received her, they<br> could not cut her thereafter.<br><br> It was characteristic of the regard in which Scarlett was held that<br> few people based their defense or their criticism of her on her<br> personal integrity. ‘I wouldn't put much beyond her,’ was the<br> universal attitude. Scarlett had made too many enemies to have<br> many champions now. Her words and her actions rankled in too many<br> hearts for many people to care whether this scandal hurt her or<br> not. But everyone cared violently about hurting Melanie or India<br> and the storm revolved around them, rather than Scarlett, centering<br> upon the one question--’Did India lie?’<br><br> Those who espoused Melanie's side pointed triumphantly to the fact<br> that Melanie was constantly with Scarlett these days. Would a<br> woman of Melanie's high principles champion the cause of a guilty<br> woman, especially a woman guilty with her own husband? No, indeed!<br> India was just a cracked old maid who hated Scarlett and lied about<br> her and induced Archie and Mrs. Elsing to believe her lies.<br><br> But, questioned India's adherents, if Scarlett isn't guilty, where<br> is Captain Butler? Why isn't he here at his wife's side, lending<br> her the strength of his countenance? That was an unanswerable<br> question and, as the weeks went by and the rumor spread that<br> Scarlett was pregnant, the pro-India group nodded with satisfaction.<br> It couldn't be Captain Butler's baby, they said. For too long the<br> fact of their estrangement had been public property. For too long<br> the town had been scandalized by the separate bedrooms.<br><br> So the gossip ran, tearing the town apart, tearing apart, too, the<br> close-knit clan of Hamiltons, Wilkeses, Burrs, Whitemans and<br> Winfields. Everyone in the family connection was forced to take<br> sides. There was no neutral ground. Melanie with cool dignity and<br> India with acid bitterness saw to that. But no matter which side<br> the relatives took, they all were resentful that Scarlett should<br> have been the cause of the family breach. None of them thought her<br> worth it. And no matter which side they took, the relatives<br> heartily deplored the fact that India had taken it upon herself to<br> wash the family dirty linen so publicly and involve Ashley in so<br> degrading a scandal. But now that she had spoken, many rushed to<br> her defense and took her side against Scarlett, even as others,<br> loving Melanie, stood by her and Scarlett.<br><br> Half of Atlanta was kin to or claimed kin with Melanie and India.<br> The ramifications of cousins, double cousins, cousins-in-law and<br> kissing cousins were so intricate and involved that no one but a<br> born Georgian could ever unravel them. They had always been a<br> clannish tribe, presenting an unbroken phalanx of overlapping<br> shields to the world in time of stress, no matter what their<br> private opinions of the conduct of individual kinsmen might be.<br> With the exception of the guerrilla warfare carried on by Aunt<br> Pitty against Uncle Henry, which had been a matter for hilarious<br> laughter within the family for years, there had never been an open<br> breach in the pleasant relations. They were gentle, quiet spoken,<br> reserved people and not given to even the amiable bickering that<br> characterized most Atlanta families.<br><br> But now they were split in twain and the town was privileged to<br> witness cousins of the fifth and sixth degree taking sides in the<br> most shattering scandal Atlanta had ever seen. This worked great<br> hardship and strained the tact and forbearance of the unrelated<br> half of the town, for the India-Melanie feud made a rupture in<br> practically every social organization. The Thalians, the Sewing<br> Circle for the Widows and Orphans of the Confederacy, the<br> Association for the Beautification of the Graves of Our Glorious<br> Dead, the Saturday Night Musical Circle, the Ladies' Evening<br> Cotillion Society, the Young Men's Library were all involved. So<br> were four churches with their Ladies' Aid and Missionary societies.<br> Great care had to be taken to avoid putting members of warring<br> factions on the same committees.<br><br> On their regular afternoons at home, Atlanta matrons were in<br> anguish from four to six o'clock for fear Melanie and Scarlett<br> would call at the same time India and her loyal kin were in their<br> parlors.<br><br> Of all the family, poor Aunt Pitty suffered the most. Pitty, who<br> desired nothing except to live comfortably amid the love of her<br> relatives, would have been very pleased, in this matter, to run<br> with the hares and hunt with the hounds. But neither the hares nor<br> the hounds would permit this.<br><br> India lived with Aunt Pitty and, if Pitty sided with Melanie, as<br> she wished to do, India would leave. And if India left her, what<br> would poor Pitty do then? She could not live alone. She would<br> have to get a stranger to live with her or she would have to close<br> up her house and go and live with Scarlett. Aunt Pitty felt<br> vaguely that Captain Butler would not care for this, or she would<br> have to go and live with Melanie and sleep in the little cubbyhole<br> that was Beau's nursery.<br><br> Pitty was not overly fond of India, for India intimidated her with<br> her dry, stiff-necked ways and her passionate convictions. But she<br> made it possible for Pitty to keep her own comfortable establishment<br> and Pitty was always swayed more by considerations of personal<br> comfort than by moral issues. And so India remained.<br><br> But her presence in the house made Aunt Pitty a storm center, for<br> both Scarlett and Melanie took that to mean that she sided with<br> India. Scarlett curtly refused to contribute more money to Pitty's<br> establishment as long as India was under the same roof. Ashley<br> sent India money every week and every week India proudly and<br> silently returned it, much to the old lady's alarm and regret.<br> Finances at the red-brick house would have been in a deplorable<br> state, but for Uncle Henry's intervention, and it humiliated Pitty<br> to take money from him.<br><br> Pitty loved Melanie better than anyone in the world, except<br> herself, and now Melly acted like a cool, polite stranger. Though<br> she practically lived in Pitty's back yard, she never once came<br> through the hedge and she used to run in and out a dozen times a<br> day. Pitty called on her and wept and protested her love and<br> devotion, but Melanie always refused to discuss matters and never<br> returned the calls.<br><br> Pitty knew very well what she owed Scarlett--almost her very<br> existence. Certainly in those black days after the war when Pitty<br> was faced with the alternative of Brother Henry or starvation,<br> Scarlett had kept her home for her, fed her, clothed her and<br> enabled her to hold up her head in Atlanta society. And since<br> Scarlett had married and moved into her own home, she had been<br> generosity itself. And that frightening fascinating Captain<br> Butler--frequently after he called with Scarlett, Pitty found<br> brand-new purses stuffed with bills on her console table or lace<br> handkerchiefs knotted about gold pieces which had been slyly<br> slipped into her sewing box. Rhett always vowed he knew nothing<br> about them and accused her, in a very unrefined way, of having a<br> secret admirer, usually the be-whiskered Grandpa Merriwether.<br><br> Yes, Pitty owed love to Melanie, security to Scarlett, and what did<br> she owe India? Nothing, except that India's presence kept her from<br> having to break up her pleasant life and make decisions for<br> herself. It was all most distressing and too, too vulgar and<br> Pitty, who had never made a decision for herself in her whole life,<br> simply let matters go on as they were and as a result spent much<br> time in uncomforted tears.<br><br> In the end, some people believed whole-heartedly in Scarlett's<br> innocence, not because of her own personal virtue but because<br> Melanie believed in it. Some had mental reservations but they were<br> courteous to Scarlett and called on her because they loved Melanie<br> and wished to keep her love. India's adherents bowed coldly and<br> some few cut her openly. These last were embarrassing, infuriating,<br> but Scarlett realized that, except for Melanie's championship and<br> her quick action, the face of the whole town would have been set<br> against her and she would have been an outcast.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER LVI<br><br> <br> Rhett was gone for three months and during that time Scarlett had<br> no word from him. She did not know where he was or how long he<br> would be gone. Indeed, she had no idea if he would ever return.<br> During this time, she went about her business with her head high<br> and her heart sick. She did not feel well physically but, forced<br> by Melanie, she went to the store every day and tried to keep up a<br> superficial interest in the mills. But the store palled on her for<br> the first time and, although the business was treble what it had<br> been the year before and the money rolling in, she could take no<br> interest in it and was sharp and cross with the clerks. Johnnie<br> Gallegher's mill was thriving and the lumber yard selling all his<br> supply easily, but nothing Johnnie did or said pleased her.<br> Johnnie, as Irish as she, finally erupted into rage at her naggings<br> and threatened to quit, after a long tirade which ended with ‘and<br> the back of both me hands to you, Ma'm, and the curse of Cromwell<br> on you.’ She had to appease him with the most abject of apologies.<br><br> She never went to Ashley's mill. Nor did she go to the lumber-yard<br> office when she thought he would be there. She knew he was<br> avoiding her, knew that her constant presence in his house, at<br> Melanie's inescapable invitations, was a torment to him. They<br> never spoke alone and she was desperate to question him. She<br> wanted to know whether he now hated her and exactly what he had<br> told Melanie, but he held her at arm's length and silently pleaded<br> with her not to speak. The sight of his face, old, haggard with<br> remorse, added to her load, and the fact that his mill lost money<br> every week was an extra irritant which she could not voice.<br><br> His helplessness in the face of the present situation irked her.<br> She did not know what he could do to better matters but she felt<br> that he should do something. Rhett would have done something.<br> Rhett always did something, even if it was the wrong thing, and she<br> unwillingly respected him for it.<br><br> Now that her first rage at Rhett and his insults had passed, she<br> began to miss him and she missed him more and more as days went by<br> without news of him. Out of the welter of rapture and anger and<br> heartbreak and hurt pride that he had left, depression emerged to<br> sit upon her shoulder like a carrion crow. She missed him, missed<br> his light flippant touch in anecdotes that made her shout with<br> laughter, his sardonic grin that reduced troubles to their proper<br> proportions, missed even his jeers that stung her to angry retort.<br> Most of all she missed having him to tell things to. Rhett was so<br> satisfactory in that respect. She could recount shamelessly and<br> with pride how she had skinned people out of their eyeteeth and he<br> would applaud. And if she even mentioned such things to other<br> people they were shocked.<br><br> She was lonely without him and Bonnie. She missed the child more<br> than she had thought possible. Remembering the last harsh words<br> Rhett had hurled at her about Wade and Ella, she tried to fill in<br> some of her empty hours with them. But it was no use. Rhett's<br> words and the children's reactions opened her eyes to a startling,<br> a galling truth. During the babyhood of each child she had been<br> too busy, too worried with money matters, too sharp and easily<br> vexed, to win their confidence or affection. And now, it was<br> either too late or she did not have the patience or the wisdom to<br> penetrate their small secretive hearts.<br><br> Ella! It annoyed Scarlett to realize that Ella was a silly child<br> but she undoubtedly was. She couldn't keep her little mind on one<br> subject any longer than a bird could stay on one twig and even when<br> Scarlett tried to tell her stories, Ella went off at childish<br> tangents, interrupting with questions about matters that had<br> nothing to do with the story and forgetting what she had asked long<br> before Scarlett could get the explanation out of her mouth. And as<br> for Wade--perhaps Rhett was right. Perhaps he was afraid of her.<br> That was odd and it hurt her. Why should her own boy, her only<br> boy, be afraid of her? When she tried to draw him out in talk, he<br> looked at her with Charles' soft brown eyes and squirmed and<br> twisted his feet in embarrassment. But with Melanie, he bubbled<br> over with talk and brought from his pocket everything from fishing<br> worms to old strings to show her.<br><br> Melanie had a way with brats. There was no getting around it. Her<br> own little Beau was the best behaved and most lovable child in<br> Atlanta. Scarlett got on better with him than she did with her own<br> son because little Beau had no self-consciousness where grown<br> people were concerned and climbed on her knee, uninvited, whenever<br> he saw her. What a beautiful blond boy he was, just like Ashley!<br> Now if only Wade were like Beau-- Of course, the reason Melanie<br> could do so much with him was that she had only one child and she<br> hadn't had to worry and work as Scarlett had. At least, Scarlett<br> tried to excuse herself that way but honesty forced her to admit<br> that Melanie loved children and would have welcomed a dozen. And<br> the over-brimming affection she had was poured out on Wade and the<br> neighbors' broods.<br><br> Scarlett would never forget the shock of the day she drove by<br> Melanie's house to pick up Wade and heard, as she came up the front<br> walk, the sound of her son's voice raised in a very fair imitation<br> of the Rebel Yell--Wade who was always as still as a mouse at home.<br> And manfully seconding Wade's yell was the shrill piping of Beau.<br> When she had walked into the sitting room she had found the two<br> charging at the sofa with wooden swords. They had hushed abashed<br> as she entered and Melanie had arisen, laughing and clutching at<br> hairpins and flying curls from where she was crouching behind the<br> sofa.<br><br> ‘It's Gettysburg,’ she explained. ‘And I'm the Yankees and I've<br> gotten the worst of it. This is General Lee,’ pointing to Beau,<br> ‘and this is General Pickett,’ putting an arm about Wade's<br> shoulder.<br><br> Yes, Melanie had a way with children that Scarlett could never<br> fathom.<br><br> ‘At least,’ she thought, ‘Bonnie loves me and likes to play with<br> me.’ But honesty forced her to admit that Bonnie infinitely<br> preferred Rhett to her. And perhaps she would never see Bonnie<br> again. For all she knew, Rhett might be in Perisa or Egypt and<br> intending to stay there forever.<br><br> When Dr. Meade told her she was pregnant, she was astounded, for<br> she had been expecting a diagnosis of biliousness and over-wrought<br> nerves. Then her mind fled back to that wild night and her face<br> went crimson at the memory. So a child was coming from those<br> moments of high rapture--even if the memory of the rapture was<br> dimmed by what followed. And for the first time she was glad that<br> she was going to have a child. If it were only a boy! A fine boy,<br> not a spiritless little creature like Wade. How she would care for<br> him! Now that she had the leisure to devote to a baby and the<br> money to smooth his path, how happy she would be! She had an<br> impulse to write to Rhett in care of his mother in Charleston and<br> tell him. Good Heavens, he must come home now! Suppose he stayed<br> away till after the baby was born! She could never explain that!<br> But if she wrote him he'd think she wanted him to come home and he<br> would be amused. And he mustn't ever think she wanted him or<br> needed him.<br><br> She was very glad she had stifled this impulse when her first news<br> of Rhett came in a letter from Aunt Pauline in Charleston where, it<br> seemed, Rhett was visiting his mother. What a relief to know he<br> was still in the United States, even if Aunt Pauline's letter was<br> infuriating. Rhett had brought Bonnie to see her and Aunt Eulalie<br> and the letter was full of praise.<br><br> ‘Such a little beauty! When she grows up she will certainly be a<br> belle. But I suppose you know that any man who courts her will<br> have a tussle with Captain Butler, for I never saw such a devoted<br> father. Now, my dear, I wish to confess something. Until I met<br> Captain Butler, I felt that your marriage with him had been a<br> dreadful mesalliance for, of course, no one in Charleston hears<br> anything good about him and everyone is so sorry for his family.<br> In fact, Eulalie and I were uncertain as to whether or not we<br> should receive him--but, after all, the dear child is our great-<br> niece. When he came, we were pleasantly surprised, most<br> pleasantly, and realized how un-Christian it is to credit idle<br> gossip. For he is most charming. Quite handsome, too, we thought,<br> and so very grave and courteous. And so devoted to you and the<br> child.<br><br> ‘And now, my dear, I must write you of something that has come to<br> our ears--something Eulalie and I were loath to believe at first.<br> We had heard, of course, that you sometimes did help out at the<br> store that Mr. Kennedy had left you. We had heard rumors but, of<br> course, we denied them. We realized that in those first dreadful<br> days after the war, it was perhaps necessary, conditions being what<br> they were. But there is no necessity now for such conduct on your<br> part, as I know Captain Butler is in quite comfortable circumstances<br> and is, moreover, fully capable of managing for you any business and<br> property you may own. We had to know the truth of these rumors and<br> were forced to ask Captain Butler point-blank questions which was<br> most distressing to all of us.<br><br> ‘With reluctance he told us that you spent your mornings at the<br> store and would permit no one else to do the bookkeeping. He also<br> admitted that you had some interest in a mill or mills (we did not<br> press him on this, being most upset at this information which was<br> news to us) that necessitated your riding about alone, or attended<br> by a ruffian who, Captain Butler assures us, is a murderer. We<br> could see how this wrung his heart and think he must be a most<br> indulgent--in fact, a far too indulgent husband. Scarlett, this<br> must stop. Your mother is not here to command you and I must do it<br> in her place. Think how your little children will feel when they<br> grow older and realize that you were in trade! How mortified they<br> will be to know that you exposed yourself to the insults of rude<br> men and the dangers of careless gossip in attending to mills. Such<br> unwomanly--’<br><br> Scarlett flung down the letter unfinished, with an oath. She could<br> just see Aunt Pauline and Aunt Eulalie sitting in judgment on her<br> in the crumbling house on the Battery with little between them and<br> starvation except what she, Scarlett, sent them every month.<br> Unwomanly? By God, if she hadn't been unwomanly Aunt Pauline and<br> Aunt Eulalie probably wouldn't have a roof over their heads this<br> very moment. And damn Rhett for telling them about the store and<br> the bookkeeping and the mills! Reluctant, was he? She knew very<br> well the joy he took in palming himself off on the old ladies as<br> grave, courteous and charming, the devoted husband and father.<br> How he must have loved harrowing them with descriptions of her<br> activities with the store, the mills, the saloon. What a devil he<br> was. Why did such perverse things give him such pleasure?<br><br> But soon, even this rage passed into apathy. So much of the keen<br> zest had gone out of life recently. If only she could recapture<br> the thrill and the glow of Ashley--if only Rhett would come home<br> and make her laugh.<br><br> <br><br> They were home again, without warning. The first intimation of<br> their return was the sound of luggage being thumped on the front-<br> hall floor and Bonnie's voice crying, ‘Mother!’<br><br> Scarlett hurried from her room to the top of the stairs and saw her<br> daughter stretching her short plump legs in an effort to climb the<br> steps. A resigned striped kitten was clutched to her breast.<br><br> ‘Gran'ma gave him to me,’ she cried excitedly, holding the kitten<br> out by the scruff.<br><br> Scarlett swept her up into her arms and kissed her, thankful that<br> the child's presence spared her her first meeting alone with Rhett.<br> Looking over Bonnie's head, she saw him in the hall below, paying<br> the cab driver. He looked up, saw her and swept off his hat in a<br> wide gesture, bowing as he did. When she met his dark eyes, her<br> heart leaped. No matter what he was, no matter what he had done,<br> he was home and she was glad.<br><br> ‘Where's Mammy?’ asked Bonnie, wriggling in Scarlett's grasp and<br> she reluctantly set the child on her feet.<br><br> It was going to be more difficult than she anticipated, greeting<br> Rhett with just the proper degree of casualness and, as for telling<br> him about the new baby! She looked at his face as he came up the<br> steps, that dark nonchalant face, so impervious, so blank. No,<br> she'd wait to tell him. She couldn't tell him right away. And<br> yet, such tidings as these belonged first to a husband, for a<br> husband was always happy to hear them. But she did not think he<br> would be happy about it.<br><br> She stood on the landing, leaning against the banisters and<br> wondered if he would kiss her. But he did not. He said only:<br> ‘You are looking pale, Mrs. Butler. Is there a rouge shortage?’<br><br> No word of missing her, even if he didn't mean it. And he might<br> have at least kissed her in front of Mammy who, after bobbing a<br> curtsy, was leading Bonnie away down the hall to the nursery. He<br> stood beside her on the landing, his eyes appraising her carelessly.<br><br> ‘Can this wanness mean that you've been missing me?’ he questioned<br> and though his lips smiled, his eyes did not.<br><br> So that was going to be his attitude. He was going to be as<br> hateful as ever. Suddenly the child she was carrying became a<br> nauseating burden instead of something she had gladly carried, and<br> this man before her, standing carelessly with his wide Panama hat<br> upon his hip, her bitterest foe, the cause of all her troubles.<br> There was venom in her eyes as she answered, venom that was too<br> unmistakable to be missed, and the smile went from his face.<br><br> ‘If I'm pale it's your fault and not because I've missed you, you<br> conceited thing. It's because--’ Oh, she hadn't intended to tell<br> him like this but the hot words rushed to her lips and she flung<br> them at him, careless of the servants who might hear. ‘It's<br> because I'm going to have a baby!’<br><br> He sucked in his breath suddenly and his eyes went rapidly over<br> her. He took a quick step toward her as though to put a hand on<br> her arm but she twisted away from him, and before the hate in her<br> eyes his face hardened.<br><br> ‘Indeed!’ he said coolly. ‘Well, who's the happy father? Ashley?’<br><br> She clutched the newel post until the ears of the carved lion dug<br> with sudden pain into her palm. Even she who knew him so well had<br> not anticipated this insult. Of course, he was joking but there<br> were some jokes too monstrous to be borne. She wanted to rake her<br> sharp nails across his eyes and blot out that queer light in them.<br><br> ‘Damn you!’ she began, her voice shaking with sick rage. ‘You--you<br> know it's yours. And I don't want it any more than you do. No--no<br> woman would want the children of a cad like you. I wish-- Oh,<br> God, I wish it was anybody's baby but yours!’<br><br> She saw his swarthy face change suddenly, anger and something she<br> could not analyze making it twitch as though stung.<br><br> ‘There!’ she thought in a hot rage of pleasure. ‘There! I've hurt<br> him now!’<br><br> But the old impassive mask was back across his face and he stroked<br> one side of his mustache.<br><br> ‘Cheer up,’ he said, turning from her and starting up the stairs,<br> ‘maybe you'll have a miscarriage.’<br><br> For a dizzy moment she thought what childbearing meant, the nausea<br> that tore her, the tedious waiting, the thickening of her figure,<br> the hours of pain. Things no man could ever realize. And he dared<br> to joke. She would claw him. Nothing but the sight of blood upon<br> his dark face would ease this pain in her heart. She lunged for<br> him, swift as a cat, but with a light startled movement, he<br> sidestepped, throwing up his arm to ward her off. She was standing<br> on the edge of the freshly waxed top step, and as her arm with the<br> whole weight of her body behind it, struck his out-thrust arm, she<br> lost her balance. She made a wild clutch for the newel post and<br> missed it. She went down the stairs backwards, feeling a sickening<br> dart of pain in her ribs as she landed. And, too dazed to catch<br> herself, she rolled over and over to the bottom of the flight.<br><br> <br><br> It was the first time Scarlett had ever been ill, except when she<br> had her babies, and somehow those times did not count. She had not<br> been forlorn and frightened then, as she was now, weak and pain<br> racked and bewildered. She knew she was sicker than they dared<br> tell her, feebly realized that she might die. The broken rib<br> stabbed when she breathed, her bruised face and head ached and her<br> whole body was given over to demons who plucked at her with hot<br> pinchers and sawed on her with dull knives and left her, for short<br> intervals, so drained of strength that she could not regain grip on<br> herself before they returned. No, childbirth had not been like<br> this. She had been able to eat hearty meals two hours after Wade<br> and Ella and Bonnie had been born, but now the thought of anything<br> but cool water brought on feeble nausea.<br><br> How easy it was to have a child and how painful not to have one!<br> Strange, what a pang it had been even in her pain, to know that she<br> would not have this child. Stranger still that it should have been<br> the first child she really wanted. She tried to think why she<br> wanted it but her mind was too tired. Her mind was too tired to<br> think of anything except fear of death. Death was in the room and<br> she had no strength to confront it, to fight it back and she was<br> frightened. She wanted someone strong to stand by her and hold her<br> hand and fight off death until enough strength came back for her to<br> do her own fighting.<br><br> Rage had been swallowed up in pain and she wanted Rhett. But he<br> was not there and she could not bring herself to ask for him.<br><br> Her last memory of him was how he looked as he picked her up in the<br> dark hall at the bottom of the steps, his face white and wiped<br> clean of all save hideous fear, his voice hoarsely calling for<br> Mammy. And then there was a faint memory of being carried<br> upstairs, before darkness came over her mind. And then pain and<br> more pain and the room full of buzzing voices and Aunt Pittypat's<br> sobs and Dr. Meade's brusque orders and feet that hurried on the<br> stairs and tiptoes in the upper hall. And then like a blinding ray<br> of lightning, the knowledge of death and fear that suddenly made<br> her try to scream a name and the scream was only a whisper.<br><br> But that forlorn whisper brought instant response from somewhere in<br> the darkness beside the bed and the soft voice of the one she<br> called made answer in lullaby tones: ‘I'm here, dear. I've been<br> right here all the time.’<br><br> Death and fear receded gently as Melanie took her hand and laid it<br> quietly against her cool cheek. Scarlett tried to turn to see her<br> face and could not. Melly was having a baby and the Yankees were<br> coming. The town was afire and she must hurry, hurry. But Melly<br> was having a baby and she couldn't hurry. She must stay with her<br> till the baby came and be strong because Melly needed her strength.<br> Melly was hurting so bad--there were hot pinchers at her and dull<br> knives and recurrent waves of pain. She must hold Melly's hand.<br><br> But Dr. Meade was there after all, he had come, even if the soldiers<br> at the depot did need him for she heard him say: ‘Delirious.<br> Where's Captain Butler?’<br><br> The night was dark and then light and sometimes she was having a<br> baby and sometimes it was Melanie who cried out, but through it all<br> Melly was there and her hands were cool and she did not make futile<br> anxious gestures or sob like Aunt Pitty. Whenever Scarlett opened<br> her eyes, she said ‘Melly?’ and the voice answered. And usually<br> she started to whisper: ‘Rhett--I want Rhett’ and remembered, as<br> from a dream, that Rhett didn't want her, that Rhett's face was<br> dark as an Indian's and his teeth were white in a jeer. She wanted<br> him and he didn't want her.<br><br> Once she said ‘Melly?’ and Mammy's voice said: ‘S'me, chile,’ and<br> put a cold rag on her forehead and she cried fretfully: ‘Melly--<br> Melanie’ over and over but for a long time Melanie did not come.<br> For Melanie was sitting on the edge of Rhett's bed and Rhett, drunk<br> and sobbing, was sprawled on the floor, crying, his head in her<br> lap.<br><br> Every time she had come out of Scarlett's room she had seen him,<br> sitting on his bed, his door wide, watching the door across the<br> hall. The room was untidy, littered with cigar butts and dishes of<br> untouched food. The bed was tumbled and unmade and he sat on it,<br> unshaven and suddenly gaunt, endlessly smoking. He never asked<br> questions when he saw her. She always stood in the doorway for a<br> minute, giving the news: ‘I'm sorry, she's worse,’ or ‘No, she<br> hasn't asked for you yet. You see, she's delirious’ or ‘You<br> mustn't give up hope, Captain Butler. Let me fix you some hot<br> coffee and something to eat. You'll make yourself ill.’<br><br> Her heart always ached with pity for him, although she was almost<br> too tired and sleepy to feel anything. How could people say such<br> mean things about him--say he was heartless and wicked and<br> unfaithful to Scarlett, when she could see him getting thin before<br> her eyes, see the torment in his face? Tired as she was, she<br> always tried to be kinder than usual when she gave bulletins from<br> the sick room. He looked so like a damned soul waiting judgment--<br> so like a child in a suddenly hostile world. But everyone was like<br> a child to Melanie.<br><br> But when, at last, she went joyfully to his door to tell him that<br> Scarlett was better, she was unprepared for what she found. There<br> was a half-empty bottle of whisky on the table by the bed and the<br> room reeked with the odor. He looked at her with bright glazed<br> eyes and his jaw muscles trembled despite his efforts to set his<br> teeth.<br><br> ‘She's dead?’<br><br> ‘Oh, no. She's much better.’<br><br> He said: ‘Oh, my God,’ and put his head in his hands. She saw his<br> wide shoulders shake as with a nervous chill and, as she watched<br> him pityingly, her pity changed to horror for she saw that he was<br> crying. Melanie had never seen a man cry and of all men, Rhett, so<br> suave, so mocking, so eternally sure of himself.<br><br> It frightened her, the desperate choking sound he made. She had a<br> terrified thought that he was drunk and Melanie was afraid of<br> drunkenness. But when he raised his head and she caught one<br> glimpse of his eyes, she stepped swiftly into the room, closed the<br> door softly behind her and went to him. She had never seen a man<br> cry but she had comforted the tears of many children. When she put<br> a soft hand on his shoulder, his arms went suddenly around her<br> skirts. Before she knew how it happened she was sitting on the bed<br> and he was on the floor, his head in her lap and his arms and hands<br> clutching her in a frantic clasp that hurt her.<br><br> She stroked the black head gently and said: ‘There! There!’<br> soothingly. ‘There! She's going to get well.’<br><br> At her words, his grip tightened and he began speaking rapidly,<br> hoarsely, babbling as though to a grave which would never give up<br> its secrets, babbling the truth for the first time in his life,<br> baring himself mercilessly to Melanie who was at first, utterly<br> uncomprehending, utterly maternal. He talked brokenly, burrowing<br> his head in her lap, tugging at the folds of her skirt. Sometimes<br> his words were blurred, muffled, sometimes they came far too<br> clearly to her ears, harsh, bitter words of confession and<br> abasement, speaking of things she had never heard even a woman<br> mention, secret things that brought the hot blood of modesty to her<br> cheeks and made her grateful for his bowed head.<br><br> She patted his head as she did little Beau's and said: ‘Hush!<br> Captain Butler! You must not tell me these things! You are not<br> yourself. Hush!’ But his voice went on in a wild torrent of<br> outpouring and he held to her dress as though it were his hope of<br> life.<br><br> He accused himself of deeds she did not understand; he mumbled the<br> name of Belle Watling and then he shook her with his violence as he<br> cried: ‘I've killed Scarlett, I've killed her. You don't<br> understand. She didn't want this baby and--’<br><br> ‘You must hush! You are beside yourself! Not want a baby? Why<br> every woman wants--’<br><br> ‘No! No! You want babies. But she doesn't. Not my babies--’<br><br> ‘You must stop!’<br><br> ‘You don't understand. She didn't want a baby and I made her.<br> This--this baby--it's all my damned fault. We hadn't been sleeping<br> together--’<br><br> ‘Hush, Captain Butler! It is not fit--’<br><br> ‘And I was drunk and insane and I wanted to hurt her--because she<br> had hurt me. I wanted to--and I did--but she didn't want me.<br> She's never wanted me. She never has and I tried--I tried so hard<br> and--’<br><br> ‘Oh, please!’<br><br> ‘And I didn't know about this baby till the other day--when she<br> fell. She didn't know where I was to write to me and tell me--but<br> she wouldn't have written me if she had known. I tell you--I tell<br> you I'd have come straight home--if I'd only known--whether she<br> wanted me home or not. . . .’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes, I know you would!’<br><br> ‘God, I've been crazy these weeks, crazy and drunk! And when she<br> told me, there on the steps--what did I do? What did I say? I<br> laughed and said: 'Cheer up. Maybe you'll have a miscarriage.'<br> And she--’<br><br> Melanie suddenly went white and her eyes widened with horror as she<br> looked down at the black tormented head writhing in her lap. The<br> afternoon sun streamed in through the open window and suddenly she<br> saw, as for the first time, how large and brown and strong his<br> hands were and how thickly the black hairs grew along the backs of<br> them. Involuntarily, she recoiled from them. They seemed so<br> predatory, so ruthless and yet, twined in her skirt, so broken, so<br> helpless.<br><br> Could it be possible that he had heard and believed the preposterous<br> lie about Scarlett and Ashley and become jealous? True, he had left<br> town immediately after the scandal broke but-- No, it couldn't be<br> that. Captain Butler was always going off abruptly on journeys. He<br> couldn't have believed the gossip. He was too sensible. If that<br> had been the cause of the trouble, wouldn't he have tried to shoot<br> Ashley? Or at least demanded an explanation?<br><br> No, it couldn't be that. It was only that he was drunk and sick<br> from strain and his mind was running wild, like a man delirious,<br> babbling wild fantasies. Men couldn't stand strains as well as<br> women. Something had upset him, perhaps he had had a small quarrel<br> with Scarlett and magnified it. Perhaps some of the awful things<br> he said were true. But all of them could not be true. Oh, not<br> that last, certainly! No man could say such a thing to a woman he<br> loved as passionately as this man loved Scarlett. Melanie had never<br> seen evil, never seen cruelty, and now that she looked on them for<br> the first time she found them too inconceivable to believe. He was<br> drunk and sick. And sick children must be humored.<br><br> ‘There! There!’ she said crooningly. ‘Hush, now. I understand.’<br><br> He raised his head violently and looked up at her with bloodshot<br> eyes, fiercely throwing off her hands.<br><br> ‘No, by God, you don't understand! You can't understand! You're--<br> you're too good to understand. You don't believe me but it's all<br> true and I'm a dog. Do you know why I did it? I was mad, crazy<br> with jealousy. She never cared for me and I thought I could make<br> her care. But she never cared. She doesn't love me. She never<br> has. She loves--’<br><br> His passionate, drunken gaze met hers and he stopped, mouth open,<br> as though for the first time he realized to whom he was speaking.<br> Her face was white and strained but her eyes were steady and sweet<br> and full of pity and unbelief. There was a luminous serenity in<br> them and the innocence in the soft brown depths struck him like a<br> blow in the face, clearing some of the alcohol out of his brain,<br> halting his mad, careering words in mid-flight. He trailed off<br> into a mumble, his eyes dropping away from hers, his lids batting<br> rapidly as he fought back to sanity.<br><br> ‘I'm a cad,’ he muttered, dropping his head tiredly back into her<br> lap. ‘But not that big a cad. And if I did tell you, you wouldn't<br> believe me, would you? You're too good to believe me. I never<br> before knew anybody who was really good. You wouldn't believe me,<br> would you?’<br><br> ‘No, I wouldn't believe you,’ said Melanie soothingly, beginning to<br> stroke his hair again. ‘She's going to get well. There, Captain<br> Butler! Don't cry! She's going to get well.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LVII<br><br> <br> It was a pale, thin woman that Rhett put on the Jonesboro train a<br> month later. Wade and Ella, who were to make the trip with her,<br> were silent and uneasy at their mother's still, white face. They<br> clung close to Prissy, for even to their childish minds there was<br> something frightening in the cold, impersonal atmosphere between<br> their mother and their stepfather.<br><br> Weak as she was, Scarlett was going home to Tara. She felt that<br> she would stifle if she stayed in Atlanta another day, with her<br> tired mind forcing itself round and round the deeply worn circle of<br> futile thoughts about the mess she was in. She was sick in body<br> and weary in mind and she was standing like a lost child in a<br> nightmare country in which there was no familiar landmark to guide<br> her.<br><br> As she had once fled Atlanta before an invading army, so she was<br> fleeing it again, pressing her worries into the back of her mind<br> with her old defense against the world: ‘I won't think of it now.<br> I can't stand it if I do. I'll think of it tomorrow at Tara.<br> Tomorrow's another day.’ It seemed that if she could only get back<br> to the stillness and the green cotton fields of home, all her<br> troubles would fall away and she would somehow be able to mold her<br> shattered thoughts into something she could live by.<br><br> Rhett watched the train until it was out of sight and on his face<br> there was a look of speculative bitterness that was not pleasant.<br> He sighed, dismissed the carriage and mounting his horse, rode down<br> Ivy Street toward Melanie's house.<br><br> It was a warm morning and Melanie sat on the vine-shaded porch, her<br> mending basket piled high with socks. Confusion and dismay filled<br> her when she saw Rhett alight from his horse and toss the reins<br> over the arm of the cast-iron negro boy who stood at the sidewalk.<br> She had not seen him alone since that too dreadful day when<br> Scarlett had been so ill and he had been so--well--so drunk.<br> Melanie hated even to think the word. She had spoken to him only<br> casually during Scarlett's convalescence and, on those occasions,<br> she had found it difficult to meet his eyes. However, he had been<br> his usual bland self at those times, and never by look or word<br> showed that such a scene had taken place between them. Ashley had<br> told her once that men frequently did not remember things said and<br> done in drink and Melanie prayed heartily that Captain Butler's<br> memory had failed him on that occasion. She felt she would rather<br> die than learn that he remembered his outpourings. Timidity and<br> embarrassment swept over her and waves of color mounted her cheeks<br> as he came up the walk. But perhaps he had only come to ask if<br> Beau could spend the day with Bonnie. Surely he wouldn't have the<br> bad taste to come and thank her for what she had done that day!<br><br> She rose to meet him, noting with surprise, as always, how lightly<br> he walked for a big man.<br><br> ‘Scarlett has gone?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Tara will do her good,’ he said smiling. ‘Sometimes I think<br> she's like the giant Antaeus who became stronger each time he<br> touched Mother Earth. It doesn't do for Scarlett to stay away too<br> long from the patch of red mud she loves. The sight of cotton<br> growing will do her more good than all Dr. Meade's tonics.’<br><br> ‘Won't you sit down?’ said Melanie, her hands fluttering. He was<br> so very large and male, and excessively male creatures always<br> discomposed her. They seem to radiate a force and vitality that<br> made her feel smaller and weaker even than she was. He looked so<br> swarthy and formidable and the heavy muscles in his shoulders<br> swelled against his white linen coat in a way that frightened her.<br> It seemed impossible that she had seen all this strength and<br> insolence brought low. And she had held that black head in her<br> lap!<br><br> ‘Oh, dear!’ she thought in distress and blushed again.<br><br> ‘Miss Melly,’ he said gently, ‘does my presence annoy you? Would<br> you rather I went away? Pray be frank.’<br><br> ‘Oh!’ she thought. ‘He does remember! And he knows how upset I<br> am!’<br><br> She looked up at him, imploringly, and suddenly her embarrassment<br> and confusion faded. His eyes were so quiet, so kind, so<br> understanding that she wondered how she could ever have been silly<br> enough to be flurried. His face looked tired and, she thought with<br> surprise, more than a little sad. How could she have even thought<br> he'd be ill bred enough to bring up subjects both would rather<br> forget?<br><br> ‘Poor thing, he's been so worried about Scarlett,’ she thought, and<br> managing a smile, she said: ‘Do sit down, Captain Butler.’<br><br> He sat down heavily and watched her as she picked up her darning.<br><br> ‘Miss Melly, I've come to ask a very great favor of you and,’ he<br> smiled and his mouth twisted down, ‘to enlist your aid in a<br> deception from which I know you will shrink.’<br><br> ‘A--deception?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Really, I've come to talk business to you.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear. Then it's Mr. Wilkes you'd better see. I'm such a<br> goose about business. I'm not smart like Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘I'm afraid Scarlett is too smart for her own good,’ he said, ‘and<br> that is exactly what I want to talk to you about. You know how--<br> ill she's been. When she gets back from Tara she will start again<br> hammer and tongs with the store and those mills which I wish<br> devoutly would explode some night. I fear for her health, Miss<br> Melly.’<br><br> ‘Yes, she does far too much. You must make her stop and take care<br> of herself.’<br><br> He laughed.<br><br> ‘You know how headstrong she is. I never even try to argue with<br> her. She's just like a willful child. She won't let me help her--<br> she won't let anyone help her. I've tried to get her to sell her<br> share in the mills but she won't. And now, Miss Melly, I come to<br> the business matter. I know Scarlett would sell the remainder of<br> her interest in the mills to Mr. Wilkes but to no one else, and I<br> want Mr. Wilkes to buy her out.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear me! That would be nice but--’ Melanie stopped and bit<br> her lip. She could not mention money matters to an outsider.<br> Somehow, despite what he made from the mill, she and Ashley never<br> seemed to have enough money. It worried her that they saved so<br> little. She did not know where the money went. Ashley gave her<br> enough to run the house on, but when it came to extra expenses they<br> were often pinched. Of course, her doctors bills were so much, and<br> then the books and furniture Ashley ordered from New York did run<br> into money. And they had fed and clothed any number of waifs who<br> slept in their cellar. And Ashley never felt like refusing a loan<br> to any man who'd been in the Confederate Army. And--<br><br> ‘Miss Melly, I want to lend you the money,’ said Rhett.<br><br> ‘That's so kind of you, but we might never repay it.’<br><br> ‘I don't want it repaid. Don't be angry with me, Miss Melly! Please<br> hear me through. It will repay me enough to know that Scarlett will<br> not be exhausting herself driving miles to the mills every day. The<br> store will be enough to keep her busy and happy. . . . Don't you<br> see?’<br><br> ‘Well--yes--’ said Melanie uncertainly.<br><br> ‘You want your boy to have a pony don't you? And want him to go to<br> the university and to Harvard and to Europe on a Grand Tour?’<br><br> ‘Oh, of course,’ cried Melanie, her face lighting up, as always, at<br> the mention of Beau. ‘I want him to have everything but--well,<br> everyone is so poor these days that--’<br><br> ‘Mr. Wilkes could make a pile of money out of the mills some day,’<br> said Rhett. ‘And I'd like to see Beau have all the advantages he<br> deserves.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Captain Butler, what a crafty wretch you are!’ she cried,<br> smiling. ‘Appealing to a mother's pride! I can read you like a<br> book.’<br><br> ‘I hope not,’ said Rhett, and for the first time there was a gleam<br> in his eye. ‘Now will you let me lend you the money?’<br><br> ‘But where does the deception come in?’<br><br> ‘We must be conspirators and deceive both Scarlett and Mr. Wilkes.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear! I couldn't!’<br><br> ‘If Scarlett knew I had plotted behind her back, even for her own<br> good--well, you know her temper! And I'm afraid Mr. Wilkes would<br> refuse any loan I offered him. So neither of them must know where<br> the money comes from.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but I'm sure Mr. Wilkes wouldn't refuse, if he understood the<br> matter. He is so fond of Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I'm sure he is,’ said Rhett smoothly. ‘But just the same he<br> would refuse. You know how proud all the Wilkes are.’<br><br> ‘Oh, dear!’ cried Melanie miserably, ‘I wish-- Really, Captain<br> Butler, I couldn't deceive my husband.’<br><br> ‘Not even to help Scarlett?’ Rhett looked very hurt. ‘And she is<br> so fond of you!’<br><br> Tears trembled on Melanie's eyelids.<br><br> ‘You know I'd do anything in the world for her. I can never, never<br> half repay her for what she's done for me. You know.’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ he said shortly, ‘I know what she's done for you. Couldn't<br> you tell Mr. Wilkes that the money was left you in the will of some<br> relative?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Captain Butler, I haven't a relative with a penny to bless<br> him!’<br><br> ‘Then, if I sent the money through the mail to Mr. Wilkes without<br> his knowing who sent it, would you see that it was used to buy the<br> mills and not--well, given away to destitute ex-Confederates?’<br><br> At first she looked hurt at his last words, as though they implied<br> criticism of Ashley, but he smiled so understandingly she smiled<br> back.<br><br> ‘Of course I will.’<br><br> ‘So it's settled? It's to be our secret?’<br><br> ‘But I have never kept anything secret from my husband!’<br><br> ‘I'm sure of that, Miss Melly.’<br><br> As she looked at him she thought how right she had always been<br> about him and how wrong so many other people were. People had said<br> he was brutal and sneering and bad mannered and even dishonest.<br> Though many of the nicest people were now admitting they had been<br> wrong. Well! She had known from the very beginning that he was a<br> fine man. She had never received from him anything but the kindest<br> treatment, thoughtfulness, utter respect and what understanding!<br> And then, how he loved Scarlett! How sweet of him to take this<br> roundabout way of sparing Scarlett one of the loads she carried!<br><br> In an impulsive rush of feeling, she said: ‘Scarlett's lucky to<br> have a husband who's so nice to her!’<br><br> ‘You think so? I'm afraid she wouldn't agree with you, if she<br> could hear you. Besides, I want to be nice to you too, Miss Melly.<br> I'm giving you more than I'm giving Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘Me!’ she questioned, puzzled. ‘Oh, you mean for Beau.’<br><br> He picked up his hat and rose. He stood for a moment looking down<br> at the plain, heart-shaped face with its long widow's peak and<br> serious dark eyes. Such an unworldly face, a face with no defenses<br> against life.<br><br> ‘No, not Beau. I'm trying to give you something more than Beau, if<br> you can imagine that.’<br><br> ‘No, I can't,’ she said, bewildered again. ‘There's nothing in the<br> world more precious to me than Beau except Ash--except Mr. Wilkes.’<br><br> Rhett said nothing and looked down at her, his dark face still.<br><br> ‘You're mighty nice to want to do things for me, Captain Butler,<br> but really, I'm so lucky. I have everything in the world any woman<br> could want.’<br><br> ‘That's fine,’ said Rhett, suddenly grim. ‘And I intend to see<br> that you keep them.’<br><br> <br><br> When Scarlett came back from Tara, the unhealthy pallor had gone<br> from her face and her cheeks were rounded and faintly pink. Her<br> green eyes were alert and sparkling again, and she laughed aloud<br> for the first time in weeks when Rhett and Bonnie met her and Wade<br> and Ella at the depot--laughed in annoyance and amusement. Rhett<br> had two straggling turkey feathers in the brim of his hat and<br> Bonnie, dressed in a sadly torn dress that was her Sunday frock,<br> had diagonal lines of indigo blue on her cheeks and a peacock<br> feather half as long as she was in her curls. Evidently a game of<br> Indian had been in progress when the time came to meet the train<br> and it was obvious from the look of quizzical helplessness on<br> Rhett's face and the lowering indignation of Mammy that Bonnie had<br> refused to have her toilet remedied, even to meet her mother.<br><br> Scarlett said: ‘What a ragamuffin!’ as she kissed the child and<br> turned a cheek for Rhett's lips. There were crowds of people in<br> the depot or she would never have invited this caress. She could<br> not help noticing, for all her embarrassment at Bonnie's<br> appearance, that everyone in the crowd was smiling at the figure<br> father and daughter cut, smiling not in derision but in genuine<br> amusement and kindness. Everyone knew that Scarlett's youngest had<br> her father under her thumb and Atlanta was amused and approving.<br> Rhett's great love for his child had gone far toward reinstating<br> him in public opinion.<br><br> On the way home, Scarlett was full of County news. The hot, dry<br> weather was making the cotton grow so fast you could almost hear it<br> but Will said cotton prices were going to be low this fall.<br> Suellen was going to have another baby--she spelled this out so the<br> children would not comprehend--and Ella had shown unwonted spirit<br> in biting Suellen's oldest girl. Though, observed Scarlett, it was<br> no more than little Susie deserved, she being her mother all over<br> again. But Suellen had become infuriated and they had had an<br> invigorating quarrel that was just like old times. Wade had killed<br> a water moccasin, all by himself. 'Randa and Camilla Tarleton were<br> teaching school and wasn't that a joke? Not a one of the Tarletons<br> had ever been able to spell cat! Betsy Tarleton had married a fat<br> one-armed man from Lovejoy and they and Hetty and Jim Tarleton were<br> raising a good cotton crop at Fairhill. Mrs. Tarleton had a brood<br> mare and a colt and was as happy as though she had a million<br> dollars. And there were negroes living in the old Calvert house!<br> Swarms of them and they actually owned it! They'd bought it in at<br> the sheriff's sale. The place was dilapidated and it made you cry<br> to look at it. No one knew where Cathleen and her no-good husband<br> had gone. And Alex was to marry Sally, his brother's widow!<br> Imagine that, after them living in the same house for so many<br> years! Everybody said it was a marriage of convenience because<br> people were beginning to gossip about them living there alone,<br> since both Old Miss and Young Miss had died. And it had about<br> broken Dimity Munroe's heart. But it served her right. If she'd<br> had any gumption she'd have caught her another man long ago,<br> instead of waiting for Alex to get money enough to marry her.<br><br> Scarlett chattered on cheerfully but there were many things about<br> the County which she suppressed, things that hurt to think about.<br> She had driven over the County with Will, trying not to remember<br> when these thousands of fertile acres had stood green with cotton.<br> Now, plantation after plantation was going back to the forest, and<br> dismal fields of broomsedge, scrub oak and runty pines had grown<br> stealthily about silent ruins and over old cotton fields. Only one<br> acre was being farmed now where once a hundred had been under the<br> plow. It was like moving through a dead land.<br><br> ‘This section won't come back for fifty years--if it ever comes<br> back,’ Will had said. ‘Tara's the best farm in the County, thanks<br> to you and me, Scarlett, but it's a farm, a two-mule farm, not a<br> plantation. And the Fontaine place, it comes next to Tara and then<br> the Tarletons. They ain't makin' much money but they're gettin'<br> along and they got gumption. But most of the rest of the folks,<br> the rest of the farms--’<br><br> No, Scarlett did not like to remember the way the deserted County<br> looked. It seemed even sadder, in retrospect, beside the bustle<br> and prosperity of Atlanta.<br><br> ‘Has anything happened here?’ she asked when they were finally home<br> and were seated on the front porch. She had talked rapidly and<br> continuously all the way home, fearing that a silence would fall.<br> She had not had a word alone with Rhett since that day when she<br> fell down the steps and she was none too anxious to be alone with<br> him now. She did not know how he felt toward her. He had been<br> kindness itself during her miserable convalescence, but it was the<br> kindness of an impersonal stranger. He had anticipated her wants,<br> kept the children from bothering her and supervised the store and<br> the mills. But he had never said: ‘I'm sorry.’ Well, perhaps he<br> wasn't sorry. Perhaps he still thought that child that was never<br> born was not his child. How could she tell what went on in the<br> mind behind the bland dark face? But he had showed a disposition<br> to be courteous, for the first time in their married life, and a<br> desire to let life go on as though there had never been anything<br> unpleasant between them--as though, thought Scarlett, cheerlessly,<br> as though there had never been anything at all between them. Well,<br> if that was what he wanted, she could act her part too.<br><br> ‘Is everything all right?’ she repeated. ‘Did you get the new<br> shingles for the store? Did you swap the mules? For Heaven's<br> sake, Rhett, take those feathers out of your hat. You look a fool<br> and you'll be likely to wear them downtown without remembering to<br> take them out.’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Bonnie, picking up her father's hat, defensively.<br><br> ‘Everything has gone very well here,’ replied Rhett. ‘Bonnie and I<br> have had a nice time and I don't believe her hair has been combed<br> since you left. Don't suck the feathers, darling, they may be<br> nasty. Yes, the shingles are fixed and I got a good trade on the<br> mules. No, there's really no news. Everything has been quite<br> dull.’<br><br> Then, as an afterthought, he added: ‘The honorable Ashley was over<br> here last night. He wanted to know if I thought you would sell him<br> your mill and the part interest you have in his.’<br><br> Scarlett, who had been rocking and fanning herself with a turkey<br> tail fan, stopped abruptly.<br><br> ‘Sell? Where on earth did Ashley get the money? You know they<br> never have a cent. Melanie spends it as fast as he makes it.’<br><br> Rhett shrugged. ‘I always thought her a frugal little person, but<br> then I'm not as well informed about the intimate details of the<br> Wilkes family as you seem to be.’<br><br> That jab seemed in something of Rhett's old style and Scarlett grew<br> annoyed.<br><br> ‘Run away, dear,’ she said to Bonnie. ‘Mother wants to talk to<br> Father.’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Bonnie positively and climbed upon Rhett's lap.<br><br> Scarlett frowned at her child and Bonnie scowled back in so<br> complete a resemblance to Gerald O'Hara that Scarlett almost<br> laughed.<br><br> ‘Let her stay,’ said Rhett comfortably. ‘As to where he got the<br> money, it seems it was sent him by someone he nursed through a case<br> of smallpox at Rock Island. It renews my faith in human nature to<br> know that gratitude still exists.’<br><br> ‘Who was it? Anyone we know?’<br><br> ‘The letter was unsigned and came from Washington. Ashley was at a<br> loss to know who could have sent it. But then, one of Ashley's<br> unselfish temperament goes about the world doing so many good deeds<br> that you can't expect him to remember all of them.’<br><br> Had she not been so surprised at Ashley's windfall, Scarlett would<br> have taken up this gauntlet, although while at Tara she had decided<br> that never again would she permit herself to be involved in any<br> quarrel with Rhett about Ashley. The ground on which she stood in<br> this matter was entirely too uncertain and, until she knew exactly<br> where she stood with both men, she did not care to be drawn out.<br><br> ‘He wants to buy me out?’<br><br> ‘Yes. But of course, I told him you wouldn't sell.’<br><br> ‘I wish you'd let me mind my own business.’<br><br> ‘Well, you know you wouldn't part with the mills. I told him that<br> he knew as well as I did that you couldn't bear not to have your<br> finger in everybody's pie, and if you sold out to him, then you<br> wouldn't be able to tell him how to mind his own business.’<br><br> ‘You dared say that to him about me?’<br><br> ‘Why not? It's true, isn't it? I believe he heartily agreed with<br> me but, of course, he was too much of a gentleman to come right out<br> and say so.’<br><br> ‘It's a lie! I will sell them to him!’ cried Scarlett angrily.<br><br> Until that moment, she had had no idea of parting with the mills.<br> She had several reasons for wanting to keep them and their monetary<br> value was the least reason. She could have sold them for large<br> sums any time in the last few years, but she had refused all<br> offers. The mills were the tangible evidence of what she had done,<br> unaided and against great odds, and she was proud of them and of<br> herself. Most of all, she did not want to sell them because they<br> were the only path that lay open to Ashley. If the mills went from<br> her control it would mean that she would seldom see Ashley and<br> probably never see him alone. And she had to see him alone. She<br> could not go on this way any longer, wondering what his feelings<br> toward her were now, wondering if all his love had died in shame<br> since the dreadful night of Melanie's party. In the course of<br> business she could find many opportune times for conversations<br> without it appearing to anyone that she was seeking him out. And,<br> given time, she knew she could gain back whatever ground she had<br> lost in his heart. But if she sold the mills--<br><br> No, she did not want to sell but, goaded by the thought that Rhett<br> had exposed her to Ashley in so truthful and so unflattering a<br> light, she had made up her mind instantly. Ashley should have the<br> mills and at a price so low he could not help realizing how<br> generous she was.<br><br> ‘I will sell!’ she cried furiously. ‘Now, what do you think of<br> that?’<br><br> There was the faintest gleam of triumph in Rhett's eyes as he bent<br> to tie Bonnie's shoe string.<br><br> ‘I think you'll regret it,’ he said.<br><br> Already she was regretting the hasty words. Had they been spoken<br> to anyone save Rhett she would have shamelessly retracted them.<br> Why had she burst out like that? She looked at Rhett with an angry<br> frown and saw that he was watching her with his old keen, cat-at-a-<br> mouse-hole look. When he saw her frown, he laughed suddenly, his<br> white teeth flashing. Scarlett had an uncertain feeling that he<br> had jockeyed her into this position.<br><br> ‘Did you have anything to do with this?’ she snapped.<br><br> ‘I?’ His brows went up in mock surprise. ‘You should know me<br> better. I never go about the world doing good deeds if I can avoid<br> it.’<br><br> <br><br> That night she sold the mills and all her interest in them to<br> Ashley. She did not lose thereby for Ashley refused to take<br> advantage of her first low offer and met the highest bid that she<br> had ever had for them. When she had signed the papers and the<br> mills were irrevocably gone and Melanie was passing small glasses<br> of wine to Ashley and Rhett to celebrate the transaction, Scarlett<br> felt bereft, as though she had sold one of her children.<br><br> The mills had been her darlings, her pride, the fruit of her small<br> grasping hands. She had started with one little mill in those<br> black days when Atlanta was barely struggling up from ruin and<br> ashes and want was staring her in the face. She had fought and<br> schemed and nursed them through the dark times when Yankee<br> confiscation loomed, when money was tight and smart men going to<br> the wall. And now when Atlanta was covering its scars and<br> buildings were going up everywhere and newcomers flocking to the<br> town every day, she had two fine mills, two lumber yards, a dozen<br> mule teams and convict labor to operate the business at low cost.<br> Bidding farewell to them was like closing a door forever on a part<br> of her life, a bitter, harsh part but one which she recalled with a<br> nostalgic satisfaction.<br><br> She had built up this business and now she had sold it and she was<br> oppressed with the certainty that, without her at the helm, Ashley<br> would lose it all--everything that she had worked to build. Ashley<br> trusted everyone and still hardly knew a two-by-four from a six-by-<br> eight. And now she would never be able to give him the benefit of<br> her advice--all because Rhett had told him that she liked to boss<br> everything.<br><br> ‘Oh, damn Rhett!’ she thought and as she watched him the conviction<br> grew that he was at the bottom of all this. Just how and why she<br> did not know. He was talking to Ashley and his words brought her<br> up sharply.<br><br> ‘I suppose you'll turn the convicts back right away,’ he said.<br><br> Turn the convicts back? Why should there be any idea of turning<br> them back? Rhett knew perfectly well that the large profits from<br> the mills grew out of the cheap convict labor. And why did Rhett<br> speak with such certainty about what Ashley's future actions would<br> be? What did he know of him?<br><br> ‘Yes, they'll go back immediately,’ replied Ashley and he avoided<br> Scarlett's dumbfounded gaze.<br><br> ‘Have you lost your mind?’ she cried. ‘You'll lose all the money<br> on the lease and what kind of labor can you get, anyway?’<br><br> ‘I'll use free darkies,’ said Ashley.<br><br> ‘Free darkies! Fiddle-dee-dee! You know what their wages will<br> cost and besides you'll have the Yankees on your neck every minute<br> to see if you're giving them chicken three times a day and tucking<br> them to sleep under eiderdown quilts. And if you give a lazy darky<br> a couple of licks to speed him up, you'll hear the Yankees scream<br> from here to Dalton and you'll end up in jail. Why, convicts are<br> the only--’<br><br> Melanie looked down into her lap at her twisted hands. Ashley<br> looked unhappy but obdurate. For a moment he was silent. Then his<br> gaze crossed Rhett's and it was as if he found understanding and<br> encouragement in Rhett's eyes--a glance that was not lost on<br> Scarlett.<br><br> ‘I won't work convicts, Scarlett,’ he said quietly.<br><br> ‘Well, sir!’ her breath was taken away. ‘And why not? Are you<br> afraid people will talk about you like they do about me?’<br><br> Ashley raised his head.<br><br> ‘I'm not afraid of what people say as long as I'm right. And I<br> have never felt that convict labor was right.’<br><br> ‘But why--’<br><br> ‘I can't make money from the enforced labor and misery of others.’<br><br> ‘But you owned slaves!’<br><br> ‘They weren't miserable. And besides, I'd have freed them all when<br> Father died if the war hadn't already freed them. But this is<br> different, Scarlett. The system is open to too many abuses.<br> Perhaps you don't know it but I do. I know very well that Johnnie<br> Gallegher has killed at least one man at his camp. Maybe more--who<br> cares about one convict, more or less? He said the man was killed<br> trying to escape, but that's not what I've heard elsewhere. And I<br> know he works men who are too sick to work. Call it superstition,<br> but I do not believe that happiness can come from money made from<br> the sufferings of others.’<br><br> ‘God's nightgown! You mean--goodness, Ashley, you didn't swallow<br> all the Reverend Wallace's bellowings about tainted money?’<br><br> ‘I didn't have to swallow it. I believed it long before he<br> preached on it.’<br><br> ‘Then, you must think all my money is tainted,’ cried Scarlett<br> beginning to be angry. ‘Because I worked convicts and own saloon<br> property and--’ She stopped short. Both the Wilkes looked<br> embarrassed and Rhett was grinning broadly. Damn him, thought<br> Scarlett, vehemently. He's thinking that I'm sticking my finger in<br> other people's pies again and so is Ashley. I'd like to crack<br> their heads together! She swallowed her wrath and tried to assume<br> an aloof air of dignity but with little success.<br><br> ‘Of course, it's immaterial to me,’ she said.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, don't think I'm criticizing you! I'm not. It's just<br> that we look at things in different ways and what is good for you<br> might not be good for me.’<br><br> She suddenly wished that they were alone, wished ardently that<br> Rhett and Melanie were at the end of the earth, so she could cry<br> out: ‘But I want to look at things the way you look at them! Tell<br> me just what you mean, so I can understand and be like you!’<br><br> But with Melanie present, trembling with the distress of the scene,<br> and Rhett lounging, grinning at her, she could only say with as<br> much coolness and offended virtue as she could muster: ‘I'm sure<br> it's your own business, Ashley, and far be it from me to tell you<br> how to run it. But, I must say, I do not understand your attitude<br> or your remarks.’<br><br> Oh, if they were only alone, so she would not be forced to say<br> these cool things to him, these words that were making him unhappy!<br><br> ‘I've offended you, Scarlett, and I did not mean to. You must<br> believe me and forgive me. There is nothing enigmatic in what I<br> said. It is only that I believe that money which comes in certain<br> ways seldom brings happiness.’<br><br> ‘But you're wrong!’ she cried, unable to restrain herself any<br> longer. ‘Look at me! You know how my money came. You know how<br> things were before I made my money! You remember that winter at<br> Tara when it was so cold and we were cutting up the carpets for<br> shoes and there wasn't enough to eat and we used to wonder how we<br> were going to give Beau and Wade an education. You remem--’<br><br> ‘I remember,’ said Ashley tiredly, ‘but I'd rather forget.’<br><br> ‘Well, you can't say any of us were happy then, can you? And look<br> at us now! You've a nice home and a good future. And has anyone a<br> prettier house than mine or nicer clothes or finer horses? Nobody<br> sets as fine a table as me or gives nicer receptions and my<br> children have everything they want. Well, how did I get the money<br> to make it possible? Off trees? No, sir! Convicts and saloon<br> rentals and--’<br><br> ‘And don't forget murdering that Yankee,’ said Rhett softly. ‘He<br> really gave you your start.’<br><br> Scarlett swung on him, furious words on her lips.<br><br> ‘And the money has made you very, very happy, hasn't it, darling?’<br> he asked, poisonously sweet.<br><br> Scarlett stopped short, her mouth open, and her eyes went swiftly<br> to the eyes of the other three. Melanie was almost crying with<br> embarrassment, Ashley was suddenly bleak and withdrawn and Rhett<br> was watching her over his cigar with impersonal amusement. She<br> started to cry out: ‘But of course, it's made me happy!’<br><br> But somehow, she could not speak.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LVIII<br><br> <br> In the time that followed her illness Scarlett noticed a change in<br> Rhett and she was not altogether certain that she liked it. He was<br> sober and quiet and preoccupied. He was at home more often for<br> supper now and he was kinder to the servants and more affectionate<br> to Wade and Ella. He never referred to anything in their past,<br> pleasant or otherwise, and silently seemed to dare her to bring up<br> such subjects. Scarlett held her peace, for it was easier to let<br> well enough alone, and life went on smoothly enough, on the<br> surface. His impersonal courtesy toward her that had begun during<br> her convalescence continued and he did not fling softly drawled<br> barbs at her or sting her with sarcasm. She realized now that<br> though he had infuriated her with his malicious comments and roused<br> her to heated rejoinders, he had done it because he cared what she<br> did and said. Now she wondered if he cared about anything she did.<br> He was polite and disinterested and she missed his interest,<br> perverse though it had been, missed the old days of bickering and<br> retort.<br><br> He was pleasant to her now, almost as though she were a stranger;<br> but, as his eyes had once followed her, they now followed Bonnie.<br> It was as though the swift flood of his life had been diverted into<br> one narrow channel. Sometimes Scarlett thought that if Rhett had<br> given her one-half the attention and tenderness he lavished on<br> Bonnie, life would have been different. Sometimes it was hard to<br> smile when people said: ‘How Captain Butler idolizes that child!’<br> But, if she did not smile, people would think it strange and<br> Scarlett hated to acknowledge, even to herself, that she was<br> jealous of a little girl, especially when that little girl was her<br> favorite child. Scarlett always wanted to be first in the hearts<br> of those around her and it was obvious now that Rhett and Bonnie<br> would always be first with each other.<br><br> Rhett was out late many nights but he came home sober on these<br> nights. Often she heard him whistling softly to himself as he went<br> down the hall past her closed door. Sometimes men came home with<br> him in the late hours and sat talking in the dining room around the<br> brandy decanter. They were not the same men with whom he had drunk<br> the first year they were married. No rich Carpetbaggers, no<br> Scallawags, no Republicans came to the house now at his invitation.<br> Scarlett, creeping on tiptoe to the banister of the upstairs hall,<br> listened and, to her amazement, frequently heard the voices of Rene<br> Picard, Hugh Elsing, the Simmons boys and Andy Bonnell. And always<br> Grandpa Merriwether and Uncle Henry were there. Once, to her<br> astonishment, she heard the tones of Dr. Meade. And these men had<br> once thought hanging too good for Rhett!<br><br> This group was always linked in her mind with Frank's death, and<br> the late hours Rhett kept these days reminded her still more of the<br> times preceding the Klan foray when Frank lost his life. She<br> remembered with dread Rhett's remark that he would even join their<br> damned Klan to be respectable, though he hoped God would not lay so<br> heavy a penance on his shoulders. Suppose Rhett, like Frank--<br><br> One night when he was out later than usual she could stand the<br> strain no longer. When she heard the rasp of his key in the lock,<br> she threw on a wrapper and, going into the gas lit upper hall, met<br> him at the top of the stairs. His expression, absent, thoughtful,<br> changed to surprise when he saw her standing there.<br><br> ‘Rhett, I've got to know! I've got to know if you--if it's the<br> Klan--is that why you stay out so late? Do you belong--’<br><br> In the flaring gas light he looked at her incuriously and then he<br> smiled.<br><br> ‘You are way behind the times,’ he said. ‘There is no Klan in<br> Atlanta now. Probably not in Georgia. You've been listening to<br> the Klan outrage stories of your Scallawag and Carpetbagger<br> friends.’<br><br> ‘No Klan? Are you lying to try to soothe me?’<br><br> ‘My dear, when did I ever try to soothe you? No, there is no Klan<br> now. We decided that it did more harm than good because it just<br> kept the Yankees stirred up and furnished more grist for the<br> slander mill of his excellency, Governor Bullock. He knows he can<br> stay in power just so long as he can convince the Federal<br> government and the Yankee newspapers that Georgia is seething with<br> rebellion and there's a Klansman hiding behind every bush. To keep<br> in power he's been desperately manufacturing Klan outrage stories<br> where none exist, telling of loyal Republicans being hung up by the<br> thumbs and honest darkies lynched for rape. But he's shooting at a<br> nonexistent target and he knows it. Thank you for your<br> apprehensions, but there hasn't been an active Klan since shortly<br> after I stopped being a Scallawag and became an humble Democrat.’<br><br> Most of what he said about Governor Bullock went in one ear and out<br> the other for her mind was mainly occupied with relief that there<br> was no Klan any longer. Rhett would not be killed as Frank was<br> killed; she wouldn't lose her store or his money. But one word of<br> his conversation swam to the top of her mind. He had said ‘we,’<br> linking himself naturally with those he had once called the ‘Old<br> Guard.’<br><br> ‘Rhett,’ she asked suddenly, ‘did you have anything to do with the<br> breaking up of the Klan?’<br><br> He gave her a long look and his eyes began to dance.<br><br> ‘My love, I did. Ashley Wilkes and I are mainly responsible.’<br><br> ‘Ashley--and you?’<br><br> ‘Yes, platitudinously but truly, politics make strange bedfellows.<br> Neither Ashley nor I cared much for each other as bedfellows but--<br> Ashley never believed in the Klan because he's against violence of<br> any sort. And I never believed in it because it's damned<br> foolishness and not the way to get what we want. It's the one way<br> to keep the Yankees on our necks till Kingdom Come. And between<br> Ashley and me, we convinced the hot heads that watching, waiting<br> and working would get us further than nightshirts and fiery<br> crosses.’<br><br> ‘You don't mean the boys actually took your advice when you--’<br><br> ‘When I was a speculator? A Scallawag? A consorter with Yankees?<br> You forget, Mrs. Butler, that I am now a Democrat in good standing,<br> devoted to my last drop of blood to recovering our beloved state<br> from the hands of her ravishers! My advice was good advice and<br> they took it. My advice in other political matters is equally<br> good. We have a Democratic majority in the legislature now,<br> haven't we? And soon, my love, we will have some of our good<br> Republican friends behind the bars. They are a bit too rapacious<br> these days, a bit too open.’<br><br> ‘You'd help put them in jail? Why, they were your friends! They<br> let you in on that railroad-bond business that you made thousands<br> out of!’<br><br> Rhett grinned suddenly, his old mocking grin.<br><br> ‘Oh, I bear them no ill will. But I'm on the other side now and if<br> I can assist in any way in putting them where they belong, I'll do<br> it. And how that will redound to my credit! I know just enough<br> about the inside of some of these deals to be very valuable when<br> the legislature starts digging into them--and that won't be far<br> off, from the way things look now. They're going to investigate<br> the governor, too, and they'll put him in jail if they can. Better<br> tell your good friends the Gelerts and the Hundons to be ready to<br> leave town on a minute's notice, because if they can nab the<br> governor, they'll nab them too.’<br><br> For too many years Scarlett had seen the Republicans, backed up by<br> the force of the Yankee Army, in power in Georgia to believe<br> Rhett's light words. The governor was too strongly entrenched for<br> any legislature to do anything to him, much less put him in jail.<br><br> ‘How you do run on,’ she observed.<br><br> ‘If he isn't put in jail, at least he won't be reelected. We're<br> going to have a Democratic governor next time, for a change.’<br><br> ‘And I suppose you'll have something to do with it?’ she questioned<br> sarcastically.<br><br> ‘My pet, I will. I am having something to do with it now. That's<br> why I stay out so late at nights. I'm working harder than I ever<br> worked with a shovel in the gold rush, trying to help get the<br> election organized. And--I know this will hurt you, Mrs. Butler,<br> but I am contributing plenty of money to the organization, too. Do<br> you remember telling me, years ago, in Frank's store, that it was<br> dishonest for me to keep the Confederate gold? At last I've come<br> to agree with you and the Confederate gold is being spent to get<br> the Confederates back into power.’<br><br> ‘You're pouring money down a rat hole!’<br><br> ‘What! You call the Democratic party a rat hole?’ His eyes mocked<br> her and then were quiet, expressionless. ‘It doesn't matter a damn<br> to me who wins this election. What does matter is that everyone<br> knows I've worked for it and that I've spent money on it. And<br> that'll be remembered in Bonnie's favor in years to come.’<br><br> ‘I was almost afraid from your pious talk that you'd had a change<br> of heart, but I see you've got no more sincerity about the<br> Democrats than about anything else.’<br><br> ‘Not a change of heart at all. Merely a change of hide. You might<br> possibly sponge the spots off a leopard but he'd remain a leopard,<br> just the same.’<br><br> Bonnie, awakened by the sound of voices in the hall, called sleepily<br> but imperiously: ‘Daddy!’ and Rhett started past Scarlett.<br><br> ‘Rhett, wait a minute. There's something else I want to tell you.<br> You must stop taking Bonnie around with you in the afternoons to<br> political meetings. It just doesn't look well. The idea of a<br> little girl at such places! And it makes you look so silly. I<br> never dreamed that you took her until Uncle Henry mentioned it, as<br> though he thought I knew and--’<br><br> He swung round on her and his face was hard.<br><br> ‘How can you read wrong in a little girl sitting on her father's<br> lap while he talks to friends? You may think it looks silly but it<br> isn't silly. People will remember for years that Bonnie sat on my<br> lap while I helped run the Republicans out of this state. People<br> will remember for years--’ The hardness went out of his face and a<br> malicious light danced in his eyes. ‘Did you know that when people<br> ask her who she loves best, she says 'Daddy and the Demiquats,' and<br> who she hates most, she says: 'The Scallywags.' People, thank<br> God, remember things like that.’<br><br> Scarlett's voice rose furiously. ‘And I suppose you tell her I'm a<br> Scallawag!’<br><br> ‘Daddy!’ said the small voice, indignant now, and Rhett, still<br> laughing, went down the hall to his daughter.<br><br> <br><br> That October Governor Bullock resigned his office and fled from<br> Georgia. Misuse of public funds, waste and corruption had reached<br> such proportions during his administration that the edifice was<br> toppling of its own weight. Even his own party was split, so great<br> had public indignation become. The Democrats had a majority in the<br> legislature now, and that meant just one thing. Knowing that he<br> was going to be investigated and fearing impeachment, Bullock did<br> not wait. He hastily and secretly decamped, arranging that his<br> resignation would not become public until he was safely in the<br> North.<br><br> When it was announced, a week after his flight, Atlanta was wild<br> with excitement and joy. People thronged the streets, men laughing<br> and shaking hands in congratulation, ladies kissing each other and<br> crying. Everybody gave parties in celebration and the fire<br> department was kept busy fighting the flames that spread from the<br> bonfires of jubilant small boys.<br><br> Almost out of the woods! Reconstruction's almost over! to be sure,<br> the acting governor was a Republican too, but the election was<br> coming up in December and there was no doubt in anyone's mind as to<br> what the result would be. And when the election came, despite the<br> frantic efforts of the Republicans, Georgia once more had a<br> Democratic governor.<br><br> There was joy then, excitement too, but of a different sort from<br> that which seized the town when Bullock took to his heels. This was<br> a more sober heartfelt joy, a deep-souled feeling of thanksgiving,<br> and the churches were filled as ministers reverently thanked God for<br> the deliverance of the state. There was pride too, mingled with the<br> elation and joy, pride that Georgia was back in the hands of her own<br> people again, in spite of all the administration in Washington could<br> do, in spite of the army, the Carpetbaggers, the Scallawags and the<br> native Republicans.<br><br> Seven times Congress had passed crushing acts against the state to<br> keep it a conquered province, three times the army had set aside<br> civil law. The negroes had frolicked through the legislature,<br> grasping aliens had mismanaged the government, private individuals<br> had enriched themselves from public funds. Georgia had been<br> helpless, tormented, abused, hammered down. But now, in spite of<br> them all, Georgia belonged to herself again and through the efforts<br> of her own people.<br><br> The sudden overturn of the Republicans did not bring joy to<br> everyone. There was consternation in the ranks of the Scallawags,<br> the Carpetbaggers and the Republicans. The Gelerts and Hundons,<br> evidently apprised of Bullock's departure before his resignation<br> became public, left town abruptly, disappearing into that oblivion<br> from which they had come. The other Carpetbaggers and Scallawags<br> who remained were uncertain, frightened, and they hovered together<br> for comfort, wondering what the legislative investigation would<br> bring to light concerning their own private affairs. They were not<br> insolent now. They were stunned, bewildered, afraid. And the<br> ladies who called on Scarlett said over and over:<br><br> ‘But who would have thought it would turn out this way? We thought<br> the governor was too powerful. We thought he was here to stay. We<br> thought--’<br><br> Scarlett was equally bewildered by the turn of events, despite<br> Rhett's warning as to the direction it would take. It was not that<br> she was sorry Bullock had gone and the Democrats were back again.<br> Though no one would have believed it she, too, felt a grim<br> happiness that the Yankee rule was at last thrown off. She<br> remembered all too vividly her struggles during those first days of<br> Reconstruction, her fears that the soldiers and the Carpetbaggers<br> would confiscate her money and her property. She remembered her<br> helplessness and her panic at her helplessness and her hatred of<br> the Yankees who had imposed this galling system upon the South.<br> And she had never stopped hating them. But, in trying to make the<br> best of things, in trying to obtain complete security, she had gone<br> with the conquerors. No matter how much she disliked them, she had<br> surrounded herself with them, cut herself off from her old friends<br> and her old ways of living. And now the power of the conquerors<br> was at an end. She had gambled on the continuance of the Bullock<br> regime and she had lost.<br><br> As she looked about her, that Christmas of 1871, the happiest<br> Christmas the state had known in over ten years, she was disquieted.<br> She could not help seeing that Rhett, once the most execrated man in<br> Atlanta, was now one of the most popular, for he had humbly recanted<br> his Republican heresies and given his time and money and labor and<br> thought to helping Georgia fight her way back. When he rode down<br> the streets, smiling, tipping his hat, the small blue bundle that<br> was Bonnie perched before him on his saddle, everyone smiled back,<br> spoke with enthusiasm and looked with affection on the little girl.<br> Whereas, she, Scarlett--<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LIX<br><br> <br> There was no doubt in anyone's mind that Bonnie Butler was running<br> wild and needed a firm hand but she was so general a favorite that<br> no one had the heart to attempt the necessary firmness. She had<br> first gotten out of control the months when she traveled with her<br> father. When she had been with Rhett in New Orleans and Charleston<br> she had been permitted to sit up as late as she pleased and had<br> gone to sleep in his arms in theaters, restaurants and at card<br> tables. Thereafter, nothing short of force would make her go to<br> bed at the same time as the obedient Ella. While she had been away<br> with him, Rhett had let her wear any dress she chose and, since<br> that time, she had gone into tantrums when Mammy tried to dress her<br> in dimity frocks and pinafores instead of blue taffeta and lace<br> collars.<br><br> There seemed no way to regain the ground which had been lost when<br> the child was away from home and later when Scarlett had been ill<br> and at Tara. As Bonnie grew older Scarlett tried to discipline<br> her, tried to keep her from becoming too headstrong and spoiled,<br> but with little success. Rhett always sided with the child, no<br> matter how foolish her desires or how outrageous her behavior. He<br> encouraged her to talk and treated her as an adult, listening to<br> her opinions with apparent seriousness and pretending to be guided<br> by them. As a result, Bonnie interrupted her elders whenever she<br> pleased and contradicted her father and put him in his place. He<br> only laughed and would not permit Scarlett even to slap the little<br> girl's hand by way of reprimand.<br><br> ‘If she wasn't such a sweet, darling thing, she'd be impossible,’<br> thought Scarlett ruefully, realizing that she had a child with a<br> will equal to her own. ‘She adores Rhett and he could make her<br> behave better if he wanted to.’<br><br> But Rhett showed no inclination to make Bonnie behave. Whatever<br> she did was right and if she wanted the moon she could have it, if<br> he could reach it for her. His pride in her beauty, her curls, her<br> dimples, her graceful little gestures was boundless. He loved her<br> pertness, her high spirits and the quaint sweet manner she had of<br> showing her love for him. For all her spoiled and willful ways she<br> was such a lovable child that he lacked the heart to try to curb<br> her. He was her god, the center of her small world, and that was<br> too precious for him to risk losing by reprimands.<br><br> She clung to him like a shadow. She woke him earlier than he cared<br> to wake, sat beside him at the table, eating alternately from his<br> plate and her own, rode in front of him on his horse and permitted<br> no one but Rhett to undress her and put her to sleep in the small<br> bed beside his.<br><br> It amused and touched Scarlett to see the iron hand with which her<br> small child ruled her father. Who would have thought that Rhett,<br> of all people, would take fatherhood so seriously? But sometimes a<br> dart of jealousy went through Scarlett because Bonnie, at the age<br> of four, understood Rhett better than she had ever understood him<br> and could manage him better than she had ever managed him.<br><br> When Bonnie was four years old, Mammy began to grumble about the<br> impropriety of a girl child riding ‘a-straddle in front of her pa<br> wid her dress flyin' up.’ Rhett lent an attentive ear to this<br> remark, as he did to all Mammy's remarks about the proper raising<br> of little girls. The result was a small brown and white Shetland<br> pony with a long silky mane and tail and a tiny sidesaddle with<br> silver trimmings. Ostensibly the pony was for all three children<br> and Rhett bought a saddle for Wade too. But Wade infinitely<br> preferred his St. Bernard dog and Ella was afraid of all animals.<br> So the pony became Bonnie's own and was named ‘Mr. Butler.’ The<br> only flaw in Bonnie's possessive joy was that she could not still<br> ride astride like her father, but after he had explained how much<br> more difficult it was to ride on the sidesaddle, she was content<br> and learned rapidly. Rhett's pride in her good seat and her good<br> hands was enormous.<br><br> ‘Wait till she's old enough to hunt,’ he boasted. ‘There'll be no<br> one like her on any field. I'll take her to Virginia then. That's<br> where the real hunting is. And Kentucky where they appreciate good<br> riders.’<br><br> When it came to making her riding habit, as usual she had her<br> choice of colors and as usual chose blue.<br><br> ‘But, my darling! Not that blue velvet! The blue velvet is for a<br> party dress for me,’ laughed Scarlett. ‘A nice black broadcloth is<br> what little girls wear.’ Seeing the small black brows coming<br> together: ‘For Heaven's sake, Rhett, tell her how unsuitable it<br> would be and how dirty it will get.’<br><br> ‘Oh, let her have the blue velvet. If it gets dirty, we'll make<br> her another one,’ said Rhett easily.<br><br> So Bonnie had her blue velvet habit with a skirt that trailed down<br> the pony's side and a black hat with a red plume in it, because<br> Aunt Melly's stories of Jeb Stuart's plume had appealed to her<br> imagination. On days that were bright and clear the two could be<br> seen riding down Peachtree Street, Rhett reining in his big black<br> horse to keep pace with the fat pony's gait. Sometimes they went<br> tearing down the quiet roads about the town, scattering chickens<br> and dogs and children, Bonnie beating Mr. Butler with her crop, her<br> tangled curls flying, Rhett holding in his horse with a firm hand<br> that she might think Mr. Butler was winning the race.<br><br> When he had assured himself of her seat, her hands, her utter<br> fearlessness, Rhett decided that the time had come for her to learn<br> to make the low jumps that were within the reach of Mr. Butler's<br> short legs. To this end, he built a hurdle in the back yard and<br> paid Wash, one of Uncle Peter's small nephews, twenty-five cents a<br> day to teach Mr. Butler to jump. He began with a bar two inches<br> from the ground and gradually worked up the height to a foot.<br><br> This arrangement met with the disapproval of the three parties<br> concerned, Wash, Mr. Butler and Bonnie. Wash was afraid of horses<br> and only the princely sum offered induced him to take the stubborn<br> pony over the bar dozens of times a day; Mr. Butler, who bore with<br> equanimity having his tail pulled by his small mistress and his<br> hooves examined constantly, felt that the Creator of ponies had not<br> intended him to put his fat body over the bar; Bonnie, who could<br> not bear to see anyone else upon her pony, danced with impatience<br> while Mr. Butler was learning his lessons.<br><br> When Rhett finally decided that the pony knew his business well<br> enough to trust Bonnie upon him, the child's excitement was<br> boundless. She made her first jump with flying colors and,<br> thereafter, riding abroad with her father held no charms for her.<br> Scarlett could not help laughing at the pride and enthusiasm of<br> father and daughter. She thought, however, that once the novelty<br> had passed, Bonnie would turn to other things and the neighborhood<br> would have some peace. But this sport did not pall. There was a<br> bare track worn from the arbor at the far end of the yard to the<br> hurdle, and all morning long the yard resounded with excited yells.<br> Grandpa Merriwether, who had made the overland trip in 1849, said<br> that the yells sounded just like an Apache after a successful<br> scalping.<br><br> After the first week, Bonnie begged for a higher bar, a bar that<br> was a foot and a half from the ground.<br><br> ‘When you are six years old,’ said Rhett. ‘Then you'll be big<br> enough for a higher jump and I'll buy you a bigger horse. Mr.<br> Butler's legs aren't long enough.’<br><br> ‘They are, too, I jumped Aunt Melly's rose bushes and they are<br> 'normously high!’<br><br> ‘No, you must wait,’ said Rhett, firm for once. But the firmness<br> gradually faded away before her incessant importunings and<br> tantrums.<br><br> ‘Oh, all right,’ he said with a laugh one morning and moved the<br> narrow white cross bar higher. ‘If you fall off, don't cry and<br> blame me!’<br><br> ‘Mother!’ screamed Bonnie, turning her head up toward Scarlett's<br> bedroom. ‘Mother! Watch me! Daddy says I can!’<br><br> Scarlett, who was combing her hair, came to the window and smiled<br> down at the tiny excited figure, so absurd in the soiled blue<br> habit.<br><br> ‘I really must get her another habit,’ she thought. ‘Though Heaven<br> only knows how I'll make her give up that dirty one.’<br><br> ‘Mother, watch!’<br><br> ‘I'm watching dear,’ said Scarlett smiling.<br><br> As Rhett lifted the child and set her on the pony, Scarlett called<br> with a swift rush of pride at the straight back and the proud set<br> of the head,<br><br> ‘You're mighty pretty, precious!’<br><br> ‘So are you,’ said Bonnie generously and, hammering a heel into Mr.<br> Butler's ribs, she galloped down the yard toward the arbor.<br><br> ‘Mother, watch me take this one!’ she cried, laying on the crop.<br><br> WATCH ME TAKE THIS ONE!<br><br> Memory rang a bell far back in Scarlett's mind. There was<br> something ominous about those words. What was it? Why couldn't<br> she remember? She looked down at her small daughter, so lightly<br> poised on the galloping pony and her brow wrinkled as a chill swept<br> swiftly through her breast. Bonnie came on with a rush, her crisp<br> black curls jerking, her blue eyes blazing.<br><br> ‘They are like Pa's eyes,’ thought Scarlett, ‘Irish blue eyes and<br> she's just like him in every way.’<br><br> And, as she thought of Gerald, the memory for which she had been<br> fumbling came to her swiftly, came with the heart stopping clarity<br> of summer lightning, throwing, for an instant, a whole countryside<br> into unnatural brightness. She could hear an Irish voice singing,<br> hear the hard rapid pounding of hooves coming up the pasture hill<br> at Tara, hear a reckless voice, so like the voice of her child:<br> ‘Ellen! Watch me take this one!’<br><br> ‘No!’ she cried. ‘No! Oh, Bonnie, stop!’<br><br> Even as she leaned from the window there was a fearful sound of<br> splintering wood, a hoarse cry from Rhett, a melee of blue velvet<br> and flying hooves on the ground. Then Mr. Butler scrambled to his<br> feet and trotted off with an empty saddle.<br><br> <br><br> On the third night after Bonnie's death, Mammy waddled slowly up<br> the kitchen steps of Melanie's house. She was dressed in black<br> from her huge men's shoes, slashed to permit freedom for her toes,<br> to her black head rag. Her blurred old eyes were bloodshot and red<br> rimmed, and misery cried out in every line of her mountainous<br> figure. Her face was puckered in the sad bewilderment of an old<br> ape but there was determination in her jaw.<br><br> She spoke a few soft words to Dilcey who nodded kindly, as though<br> an unspoken armistice existed in their old feud. Dilcey put down<br> the supper dishes she was holding and went quietly through the<br> pantry toward the dining room. In a minute Melanie was in the<br> kitchen, her table napkin in her hand, anxiety in her face.<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlet isn't--’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett bearin' up, same as allus,’ said Mammy heavily. ‘Ah<br> din' ten ter 'sturb yo' supper, Miss Melly. Ah kin wait tell you<br> thoo ter tell you whut Ah got on mah mine.’<br><br> ‘Supper can wait,’ said Melanie. ‘Dilcey, serve the rest of the<br> supper. Mammy, come with me.’<br><br> Mammy waddled after her, down the hall past the dining room where<br> Ashley sat at the head of the table, his own little Beau beside him<br> and Scarlett's two children opposite, making a great clatter with<br> their soup spoons. The happy voices of Wade and Ella filled the<br> room. It was like a picnic for them to spend so long a visit with<br> Aunt Melly. Aunt Melly was always so kind and she was especially<br> so now. The death of their younger sister had affected them very<br> little. Bonnie had fallen off her pony and Mother had cried a long<br> time and Aunt Melly had taken them home with her to play in the<br> back yard with Beau and have tea cakes whenever they wanted them.<br><br> Melanie led the way to the small book-lined sitting room, shut the<br> door and motioned Mammy to the sofa.<br><br> ‘I was going over right after supper,’ she said. ‘Now that Captain<br> Butler's mother has come, I suppose the funeral will be tomorrow<br> morning.’<br><br> ‘De fune'l. Dat's jes' it,’ said Mammy. ‘Miss Melly, we's all in<br> deep trouble an' Ah's come ter you fer he'p. Ain' nuthin' but<br> weery load, honey, nuthin' but weery load.’<br><br> ‘Has Miss Scarlett collapsed?’ questioned Melanie worriedly. ‘I've<br> hardly seen her since Bonnie-- She has been in her room and<br> Captain Butler has been out of the house and--’<br><br> Suddenly tears began to flow down Mammy's black face. Melanie sat<br> down beside her and patted her arm and, after a moment, Mammy<br> lifted the hem of her black skirt and dried her eyes.<br><br> ‘You got ter come he'p us, Miss Melly. Ah done de bes' Ah kin but<br> it doan do no good.’<br><br> ‘Miss Scarlett--’<br><br> Mammy straightened.<br><br> ‘Miss Melly, you knows Miss Scarlett well's Ah does. Whut dat<br> chile got ter stan', de good Lawd give her strent ter stan'.<br> Disyere done broke her heart but she kin stan' it. It's Mist'<br> Rhett Ah come 'bout.’<br><br> ‘I have so wanted to see him but whenever I've been there, he has<br> either been downtown or locked in his room with-- And Scarlett has<br> looked like a ghost and wouldn't speak-- Tell me quickly, Mammy.<br> You know I'll help if I can.’<br><br> Mammy wiped her nose on the back of her hand.<br><br> ‘Ah say Miss Scarlett kin stan' whut de Lawd sen', kase she done<br> had ter stan' a-plen'y, but Mist' Rhett--Miss Melly, he ain' never<br> had ter stan' nuthin' he din' wanter stan', not nuthin'. It's him<br> Ah come ter see you 'bout.’<br><br> ‘But--’<br><br> ‘Miss Melly, you got ter come home wid me, dis evenin'.’ There was<br> urgency in Mammy's voice. ‘Maybe Mist' Rhett lissen ter you. He<br> allus did think a heap of yo' 'pinion.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Mammy, what is it? What do you mean?’<br><br> Mammy squared her shoulders.<br><br> ‘Miss Melly, Mist' Rhett done--done los' his mine. He woan let us<br> put Lil Miss away.’<br><br> ‘Lost his mind? Oh, Mammy, no!’<br><br> ‘Ah ain' lyin'. It's de Gawd's truff. He ain' gwine let us buhy<br> dat chile. He done tole me so hisseff, not mo'n an hour ago.’<br><br> ‘But he can't--he isn't--’<br><br> ‘Dat's huccome Ah say he los' his mine.’<br><br> ‘But why--’<br><br> ‘Miss Melly, Ah tell you eve'ything. Ah oughtn' tell nobody, but<br> you is our fambly an' you is de onlies' one Ah kin tell. Ah tell<br> you eve'ything. You knows whut a sto' he set by dat chile. Ah<br> ain' never seed no man, black or w'ite, set sech a sto' by any<br> chile. Look lak he go plumb crazy w'en Doctah Meade say her neck<br> broke. He grab his gun an' he run right out an' shoot dat po' pony<br> an', fo' Gawd, Ah think he gwine shoot hisseff. Ah wuz plumb<br> 'stracted whut wid Miss Scarlett in a swoon an' all de neighbors in<br> an' outer de house an' Mist' Rhett cahyin' on an' jes' holin' dat<br> chile an' not even lettin' me wash her lil face whar de grabble cut<br> it. An' w'en Miss Scarlett come to, Ah think, bress Gawd! Now dey<br> kin comfo't each other.’<br><br> Again the tears began to fall but this time Mammy did not even wipe<br> them away.<br><br> ‘But w'en she come to, she go inter de room whar he settin', holin'<br> Miss Bonnie, an' she say: 'Gimme mah baby whut you kilt.'‘<br><br> ‘Oh, no! She couldn't!’<br><br> ‘Yas'm. Dat whut she say. She say: 'You kilt her.' An' Ah felt<br> so sorry fer Mist' Rhett Ah bust out cryin', kase he look lak a<br> whup houn'. An' Ah say: 'Give dat chile ter its mammy. Ah ain'<br> gwine have no sech goin's on over mah Lil Miss.' An' Ah tek de<br> chile away frum him an' tek her inter her room an' wash her face.<br> An' Ah hear dem talkin' an' it lak ter tuhn mah blood cole, whut<br> dey say. Miss Scarlett wuz callin' him a mudderer fer lettin' her<br> try ter jump dat high, an' him sayin' Miss Scarlett hadn' never<br> keered nuthin' 'bout Miss Bonnie nor none of her chillun. . . .’<br><br> ‘Stop, Mammy! Don't tell me any more. It isn't right for you to<br> tell me this!’ cried Melanie, her mind shrinking away from the<br> picture Mammy's words evoked.<br><br> ‘Ah knows Ah got no bizness tellin' you, but mah heart too full ter<br> know jes' whut not ter say. Den he tuck her ter de unnertaker's<br> hisseff an' he bring her back an' he put her in her baid in his<br> room. An' w'en Miss Scarlett say she b'long in de pahlor in de<br> coffin, Ah thought Mist' Rhett gwine hit her. An' he say, right<br> cole lak: 'She b'long in mah room.' An' he tuhn ter me an' he<br> say: 'Mammy, you see dat she stay right hyah tell Ah gits back.'<br> Den he light outer de house on de hawse an' he wuz gone tell 'bout<br> sundown. W'en he come t'arin' home, Ah seed dat he'd been drinkin'<br> an' drinkin' heavy, but he wuz cahyin' it well's usual. He fling<br> inter de house an' not even speak ter Miss Scarlett or Miss Pitty<br> or any of de ladies as wuz callin', but he fly up de steps an'<br> th'ow open de do' of his room an' den he yell for me. W'en Ah<br> comes runnin' as fas' as Ah kin, he wuz stan'in' by de baid an' it<br> wuz so dahk in de room Ah couldn' sceercely see him, kase de<br> shutters wuz done drawed.<br><br> ‘An' he say ter me, right fierce lak: 'Open dem shutters. It's<br> dahk in hyah.' An' Ah fling dem open an' he look at me an', fo'<br> Gawd, Miss Melly, mah knees 'bout give way, kase he look so<br> strange. Den he say: 'Bring lights. Bring lots of lights. An'<br> keep dem buhnin'. An' doan draw no shades an' no shutters. Doan<br> you know Miss Bonnie's 'fraid of de dahk?'‘<br><br> Melanie's horror struck eyes met Mammy's and Mammy nodded ominously.<br><br> ‘Dat's whut he say. 'Miss Bonnie's 'fraid of de dahk.'‘<br><br> Mammy shivvered.<br><br> ‘W'en Ah gits him a dozen candles, he say 'Git!' An' den he lock<br> de do' an' dar he set wid Lil Miss, an' he din' open de do' fer<br> Miss Scarlett even w'en she beat an' hollered ter him. An' dat's<br> de way it been fer two days. He woan say nuthin' 'bout de fune'l,<br> an' in de mawnin' he lock de do' an' git on his hawse an' go off<br> ter town. An' he come back at sundown drunk an' lock hisseff in<br> agin, an' he ain' et nuthin' or slept none. An' now his ma, Ole<br> Miss Butler, she come frum Cha'ston fer de fune'l an' Miss Suellen<br> an' Mist' Will, dey come frum Tara, but Mist' Rhett woan talk ter<br> none of dem. Oh, Miss Melly, it been awful! An' it's gwine be<br> wuss, an' folks gwine talk sumpin' scan'lous.<br><br> ‘An' den, dis evenin',’ Mammy paused and again wiped her nose on<br> her hand. ‘Dis evenin' Miss Scarleft ketch him in de upstairs hall<br> w'en he come in, an' she go in de room wid him an' she say: 'De<br> fune'l set fer termorrer mawnin'.' An' he say: 'Do dat an' Ah<br> kills you termorrer.'‘<br><br> ‘Oh, he must have lost his mind!’<br><br> ‘Yas'm. An' den dey talks kinder low an' Ah doan hear all whut dey<br> say, 'cept he say agin 'bout Miss Bonnie bein' sceered of de dahk<br> an' de grabe pow'ful dahk. An' affer aw'ile, Miss Scarlett say:<br> 'You is a fine one ter tek on so, affer killin' her ter please yo'<br> pride.' An' he say: 'Ain' you got no mercy?' An' she say: 'No.<br> An' Ah ain' got no chile, needer. An' Ah'm wo'out wid de way you<br> been ackin' sence Bonnie wuz kilt. You is a scan'al ter de town.<br> You been drunk all de time an' ef you doan think Ah knows whar you<br> been spendin' yo' days, you is a fool. Ah knows you been down ter<br> dat creeter's house, dat Belle Watling.'‘<br><br> ‘Oh, Mammy, no!’<br><br> ‘Yas'm. Dat whut she said. An', Miss Melly, it's de truff.<br> Niggers knows a heap of things quicker dan w'ite folks, an' Ah<br> knowed dat's whar he been but Ah ain' said nuthin' 'bout it. An'<br> he doan deny it. He say: 'Yas'm, dat's whar Ah been an' you neen<br> tek on, kase you doan give a damn. A bawdy house is a haben of<br> refuge affer dis house of hell. An' Belle is got one of de worl's<br> kines' hearts. She doan th'ow it up ter me dat Ah done kilt mah<br> chile.'‘<br><br> ‘Oh,’ cried Melanie, stricken to the heart.<br><br> Her own life was so pleasant, so sheltered, so wrapped about with<br> people who loved her, so full of kindness that what Mammy told her<br> was almost beyond comprehension or belief. Yet there crawled into<br> her mind a memory, a picture which she hastily put from her, as she<br> would put from her the thought of another's nudity. Rhett had<br> spoken of Belle Watling the day he cried with his head on her<br> knees. But he loved Scarlett. She could not have been mistaken<br> that day. And of course, Scarlett loved him. What had come<br> between them? How could a husband and a wife cut each other to<br> pieces with such sharp knives?<br><br> Mammy took up her story heavily.<br><br> ‘Affer a w'ile, Miss Scarlett come outer de room, w'ite as a sheet<br> but her jaw set, an' she see me stan'in' dar an' she say: 'De<br> fune'l be termorrer, Mammy.' An' she pass me by lak a ghos'. Den<br> mah heart tuhn over, kase whut Miss Scarlett say, she mean. An'<br> whut Mist' Rhett say, he mean too. An' he say he kill her ef she<br> do dat. Ah wuz plumb 'stracted, Miss Melly, kase Ah done had<br> sumpin' on mah conscience all de time an' it weighin' me down.<br> Miss Melly, it wuz me as sceered Lil Miss of de dahk.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but Mammy, it doesn't matter--not now.’<br><br> ‘Yas'm, it do. Dat whut de whole trouble. An' it come ter me Ah<br> better tell Mist' Rhett even ef he kill me, kase it on mah<br> conscience. So Ah slip in de do' real quick, fo' he kin lock it,<br> an' Ah say: 'Mist' Rhett, Ah's come ter confess.' An' he swung<br> roun' on me lak a crazy man an' say: 'Git!' An', fo' Gawd, Ah<br> ain' never been so sceered! But Ah say: 'Please, suh, Mist'<br> Rhett, let me tell you. It's 'bout ter kill me. It wuz me as<br> sceered Lil Miss of de dahk.' An' den, Miss Melly, Ah put mah haid<br> down an' waited fer him ter hit me. But he din' say nuthin'. An'<br> An say: 'Ah din' mean no hahm. But, Mist' Rhett, dat chile din'<br> have no caution an' she wuzn' sceered of nuthin'. An' she wuz<br> allus gittin' outer baid affer eve'ybody sleep an runnin' roun' de<br> house barefoot. An' it worrit me, kase Ah 'fraid she hu't herseff.<br> So Ah tells her dar's ghos'es an' buggerboos in de dahk.'<br><br> ‘An' den--Miss Melly, you know whut he done? His face got right<br> gentle lak an' he come ter me an' put his han' on mah arm. Dat's<br> de fust time he ever done dat. An' he say: 'She wuz so brave,<br> wuzn' she? 'Cept fer de dahk, she wuzn' sceered of nuthin'.' An'<br> wen Ah bust out cryin' he say: 'Now, Mammy,' an' he pat me. 'Now,<br> Mammy, doan you cahy on so. Ah's glad you tole me. Ah knows you<br> love Miss Bonnie an' kase you love her, it doan matter. It's whut<br> de heart is dat matter.' Well'm dat kinder cheered me up, so Ah<br> ventu' ter say: 'Mist Rhett, suh, what 'bout de fune'l?' Den he<br> tuhn on me lak a wile man an' his eyes glitter an' he say: 'Good<br> Gawd, Ah thought you'd unnerstan' even ef nobody else din'! Does<br> you think Ah'm gwine ter put mah chile away in de dahk w'en she so<br> sceered of it? Right now Ah kin hear de way she uster scream w'en<br> she wake up in de dahk. Ah ain' gwine have her sceered.' Miss<br> Melly, den Ah know he los' his mine. He drunk an' he need sleep<br> an' sumpin' ter eat but dat ain' all. He plumb crazy. He jes'<br> push me outer de do' an' say: 'Git de hell outer hyah!'<br><br> ‘Ah goes downstairs an' Ah gits ter thinkin' dat he say dar ain'<br> gwine be no fune'l an' Miss Scarlett say it be termorrer mawnin'<br> an' he say dar be shootin'. An' all de kin-folks in de house an'<br> all de neighbors already gabblin' 'bout it lak a flock of guinea<br> hens, an' Ah thought of you, Miss Melly. You got ter come he'p<br> us.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Mammy, I couldn't intrude!’<br><br> ‘Ef you kain, who kin?’<br><br> ‘But what could I do, Mammy?’<br><br> ‘Miss Melly, Ah doan know. But you kin do sumpin'. You kin talk<br> ter Mist' Rhett an' maybe he lissen ter you. He set a gret sto' by<br> you, Miss Melly. Maybe you doan know it, but he do. Ah done hear<br> him say time an' agin, you is de onlies' gret lady he knows.’<br><br> ‘But--’<br><br> Melanie rose to her feet, confused, her heart quailing at the<br> thought of confronting Rhett. The thought of arguing with a man as<br> grief crazed as the one Mammy depicted made her go cold. The<br> thought of entering that brightly lighted room where lay the little<br> girl she loved so much wrung her heart. What could she do? What<br> could she say to Rhett that would ease his grief and bring him back<br> to reason? For a moment she stood irresolute and through the<br> closed door came the sound of her boy's treble laughter. Like a<br> cold knife in her heart came the thought of him dead. Suppose her<br> Beau were lying upstairs, his little body cold and still, his merry<br> laughter hushed.<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she cried aloud, in fright, and in her mind she clutched him<br> close to her heart. She knew how Rhett felt. If Beau were dead,<br> how could she put him away, alone with the wind and the rain and<br> the darkness?<br><br> ‘Oh! Poor, poor Captain Butler!’ she cried. ‘I'll go to him now,<br> right away.’<br><br> She sped back to the dining room, said a few soft words to Ashley<br> and surprised her little boy by hugging him close to her and<br> kissing his blond curls passionately.<br><br> She left the house without a hat, her dinner napkin still clutched<br> in her hand, and the pace she set was hard for Mammy's old legs.<br> Once in Scarlett's front hall, she bowed briefly to the gathering<br> in the library, to the frightened Miss Pittypat, the stately old<br> Mrs. Butler, Will and Suellen. She went up the stairs swiftly,<br> with Mammy panting behind her. For a moment, she paused before<br> Scarlett's closed door but Mammy hissed, ‘No'm, doan do dat.’<br><br> Down the hall Melly went, more slowly now, and stopped in front of<br> Rhett's room. She stood irresolutely for a moment as though she<br> longed to take flight. Then, bracing herself, like a small soldier<br> going into battle, she knocked on the door and called softly:<br> ‘Please let me in, Captain Butler. It's Mrs. Wilkes. I want to<br> see Bonnie.’<br><br> The door opened quickly and Mammy, shrinking back into the shadows<br> of the hall, saw Rhett huge and dark against the blazing background<br> of candles. He was swaying on his feet and Mammy could smell the<br> whisky on his breath. He looked down at Melly for a moment and<br> then, taking her by the arm, he pulled her into the room and shut<br> the door.<br><br> Mammy edged herself stealthily to a chair beside the door and sank<br> into it wearily, her shapeless body overflowing it. She sat still,<br> weeping silently and praying. Now and then she lifted the hem of<br> her dress and wiped her eyes. Strain her ears as hard as she<br> might, she could hear no words from the room, only a low broken<br> humming sound.<br><br> Alter an interminable period, the door cracked open and Melly's<br> face white and strained, appeared.<br><br> ‘Bring me a pot of coffee, quickly, and some sandwiches.’<br><br> When the devil drove, Mammy could be as swift as a lithe black<br> sixteen-year-old and her curiosity to get into Rhett's room made<br> her work faster. But her hope turned to disappointment when Melly<br> merely opened the door a crack and took the tray. For a long time<br> Mammy strained her sharp ears but she could distinguish nothing<br> except the clatter of silver on china, and the muffled soft tones<br> of Melanie's voice. Then she heard the creaking of the bed as a<br> heavy body fell upon it and, soon after, the sound of boots<br> dropping to the floor. After an interval, Melanie appeared in the<br> doorway but, strive though she might, Mammy could not see past her<br> into the room. Melanie looked tired and there were tears<br> glistening on her lashes but her face was serene again.<br><br> ‘Go tell Miss Scarlett that Captain Butler is quite willing for the<br> funeral to take place tomorrow morning,’ she whispered.<br><br> ‘Bress Gawd!’ ejaculated Mammy. ‘How on uth--’<br><br> ‘Don't talk so loud. He's going to sleep. And, Mammy, tell Miss<br> Scarlett, too, that I'll be here all night and you bring me some<br> coffee. Bring it here.’<br><br> ‘Ter disyere room?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I promised Captain Butler that if he would go to sleep I<br> would sit up by her all night. Now go tell Miss Scarlett, so she<br> won't worry any more.’<br><br> Mammy started off down the hall, her weight shaking the floor, her<br> relieved heart singing ‘Halleluja! Hallelujah!’ She paused<br> thoughtfully outside of Scarlett's door, her mind in a ferment of<br> thankfulness and curiosity.<br><br> ‘How Miss Melley done it beyon' me. De angels fight on her side,<br> Ah specs. Ah'll tell Miss Scarlett de fune'l termorrer but Ah<br> specs Ah better keep hid dat Miss Melly settin' up wid Lil Miss.<br> Miss Scarlett ain' gwine lak dat a-tall.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LX<br><br> <br> Something was wrong with the world, a somber, frightening wrongness<br> that pervaded everything like a dark impenetrable mist, stealthily<br> closing around Scarlett. This wrongness went even deeper than<br> Bonnie's death, for now the first unbearable anguish was fading<br> into resigned acceptance of her loss. Yet this eerie sense of<br> disaster to come persisted, as though something black and hooded<br> stood just at her shoulder, as though the ground beneath her feet<br> might turn to quicksand as she trod upon it.<br><br> She had never before known this type of fear. All her life her<br> feet had been firmly planted in common sense and the only things<br> she had ever feared had been the things she could see, injury,<br> hunger, poverty, loss of Ashley's love. Unanalytical she was<br> trying to analyze now and with no success. She had lost her<br> dearest child but she could stand that, somehow, as she had stood<br> other crushing losses. She had her health, she had as much money<br> as she could wish and she still had Ashley, though she saw less and<br> less of him these days. Even the constraint which had been between<br> them since the day of Melanie's ill-starred surprise party did not<br> worry her, for she knew it would pass. No, her fear was not of<br> pain or hunger or loss of love. Those fears had never weighed her<br> down as this feeling of wrongness was doing--this blighting fear<br> that was oddly like that which she knew in her old nightmare, a<br> thick, swimming mist through which she ran with bursting heart, a<br> lost child seeking a haven that was hidden from her.<br><br> She remembered how Rhett had always been able to laugh her out of<br> her fears. She remembered the comfort of his broad brown chest and<br> his strong arms. And so she turned to him with eyes that really<br> saw him for the first time in weeks. And the change she saw<br> shocked her. This man was not going to laugh, nor was he going to<br> comfort her.<br><br> For some time after Bonnie's death she had been too angry with him,<br> too preoccupied with her own grief to do more than speak politely<br> in front of the servants. She had been too busy remembering the<br> swift running patter of Bonnie's feet and her bubbling laugh to<br> think that he, too, might be remembering and with pain even greater<br> than her own. Throughout these weeks they had met and spoken as<br> courteously as strangers meeting in the impersonal walls of a<br> hotel, sharing the same roof, the same table, but never sharing the<br> thoughts of each other.<br><br> Now that she was frightened and lonely, she would have broken<br> through this barrier if she could, but she found that he was<br> holding her at arm's length, as though he wished to have no words<br> with her that went beneath the surface. Now that her anger was<br> fading she wanted to tell him that she held him guiltless of<br> Bonnie's death. She wanted to cry in his arms and say that she,<br> too, had been overly proud of the child's horsemanship, overly<br> indulgent to her wheedlings. Now she would willingly have humbled<br> herself and admitted that she had only hurled that accusation at<br> him out of her misery, hoping by hurting him to alleviate her own<br> hurt. But there never seemed an opportune moment. He looked at<br> her out of black blank eyes that made no opportunity for her to<br> speak. And apologies, once postponed, became harder and harder to<br> make, and finally impossible.<br><br> She wondered why this should be. Rhett was her husband and between<br> them there was the unbreakable bond of two people who have shared<br> the same bed, begotten and borne a loved child and seen that child,<br> too soon, laid away in the dark. Only in the arms of the father of<br> that child could she find comfort, in the exchange of memories and<br> grief that might hurt at first but would help to heal. But, now,<br> as matters stood between them, she would as soon go to the arms of<br> a complete stranger.<br><br> He was seldom at home. When they did sit down to supper together,<br> he was usually drunk. He was not drinking as he had formerly,<br> becoming increasingly more polished and biting as the liquor took<br> hold of him, saying amusing, malicious things that made her laugh<br> in spite of herself. Now he was silently, morosely drunk and, as<br> the evenings progressed, soddenly drunk. Sometimes, in the early<br> hours of the dawn, she heard him ride into the back yard and beat<br> on the door of the servants' house so that Pork might help him up<br> the back stairs and put him to bed. Put him to bed! Rhett who had<br> always drunk others under the table without turning a hair and then<br> put them to bed.<br><br> He was untidy now, where once he had been well groomed, and it took<br> all Pork's scandalized arguing even to make him change his linen<br> before supper. Whisky was showing in his face and the hard line of<br> his long jaw was being obscured under an unhealthy bloat and puffs<br> rising under his bloodshot eyes. His big body with its hard<br> swelling muscles looked soft and slack and his waist line began to<br> thicken.<br><br> Often he did not come home at all or even send word that he would<br> be away overnight. Of course, he might be snoring drunkenly in<br> some room above a saloon, but Scarlett always believed that he was<br> at Belle Watling's house on these occasions. Once she had seen<br> Belle in a store, a coarse overblown woman now, with most of her<br> good looks gone. But, for all her paint and flashy clothes, she<br> was buxom and almost motherly looking. Instead of dropping her<br> eyes or glaring defiantly, as did other light women when confronted<br> by ladies, Belle gave her stare for stare, searching her face with<br> an intent, almost pitying look that brought a flush to Scarlett's<br> cheek.<br><br> But she could not accuse him now, could not rage at him, demand<br> fidelity or try to shame him, any more than she could bring herself<br> to apologize for accusing him of Bonnie's death. She was clutched<br> by a bewildered apathy, an unhappiness that she could not<br> understand, an unhappiness that went deeper than anything she had<br> ever known. She was lonely and she could never remember being so<br> lonely before. Perhaps she had never had the time to be very<br> lonely until now. She was lonely and afraid and there was no one<br> to whom she could turn, no one except Melanie. For now, even<br> Mammy, her mainstay, had gone back to Tara. Gone permanently.<br><br> Mammy gave no explanation for her departure. Her tired old eyes<br> looked sadly at Scarlett when she asked for the train fare home.<br> To Scarlett's tears and pleading that she stay, Mammy only<br> answered: ‘Look ter me lak Miss Ellen say ter me: 'Mammy, come<br> home. Yo' wuk done finish.' So Ah's gwine home.’<br><br> Rhett, who had listened to the talk, gave Mammy the money and<br> patted her arm.<br><br> ‘You're right, Mammy. Miss Ellen is right. Your work here is<br> done. Go home. Let me know if you ever need anything.’ And as<br> Scarlett broke into renewed indignant commands: ‘Hush, you fool!<br> Let her go! Why should anyone want to stay in this house--now?’<br><br> There was such a savage bright glitter in his eyes when he spoke<br> that Scarlett shrank from him, frightened.<br><br> ‘Dr. Meade, do you think he can--can have lost his mind?’ she<br> questioned afterwards, driven to the doctor by her own sense of<br> helplessness.<br><br> ‘No,’ said the doctor, ‘but he's drinking like a fish and will kill<br> himself if he keeps it up. He loved the child, Scarlett, and I<br> guess he drinks to forget about her. Now, my advice to you, Miss,<br> is to give him another baby just as quickly as you can.’<br><br> ‘Hah!’ thought Scarlett bitterly, as she left his office. That was<br> easier said than done. She would gladly have another child,<br> several children, if they would take that look out of Rhett's eyes<br> and fill up the aching spaces in her own heart. A boy who had<br> Rhett's dark handsomeness and another little girl. Oh, for another<br> girl, pretty and gay and willful and full of laughter, not like the<br> giddy-brained Ella. Why, oh, why couldn't God have taken Ella if<br> He had to take one of her children? Ella was no comfort to her,<br> now that Bonnie was gone. But Rhett did not seem to want any other<br> children. At least he never came to her bedroom though now the<br> door was never locked and usually invitingly ajar. He did not seem<br> to care. He did not seem to care for anything now except whisky<br> and that blowzy red-haired woman.<br><br> He was bitter now, where he had been pleasantly jeering, brutal<br> where his thrusts had once been tempered with humor. After Bonnie<br> died, many of the good ladies of the neighborhood who had been won<br> over to him by his charming manners with his daughter were anxious<br> to show him kindness. They stopped him on the street to give him<br> their sympathy and spoke to him from over their hedges, saying that<br> they understood. But now that Bonnie, the reason for his good<br> manners, was gone the manners went to. He cut the ladies and their<br> well-meant condolences off shortly, rudely.<br><br> But, oddly enough, the ladies were not offended. They understood,<br> or thought they understood. When he rode home in the twilight<br> almost too drunk to stay in the saddle, scowling at those who spoke<br> to him, the ladies said ‘Poor thing!’ and redoubled their efforts<br> to be kind and gentle. They felt very sorry for him, broken<br> hearted and riding home to no better comfort than Scarlett.<br><br> Everybody knew how cold and heartless she was. Everybody was<br> appalled at the seeming ease with which she had recovered from<br> Bonnie's death, never realizing or caring to realize the effort<br> that lay behind that seeming recovery. Rhett had the town's<br> tenderest sympathy and he neither knew nor cared. Scarlett had the<br> town's dislike and, for once, she would have welcomed the sympathy<br> of old friends.<br><br> Now, none of her old friends came to the house, except Aunt Pitty,<br> Melanie and Ashley. Only the new friends came calling in their<br> shining carriages, anxious to tell her of their sympathy, eager to<br> divert her with gossip about other new friends in whom she was not<br> at all interested. All these ‘new people,’ strangers, every one!<br> They didn't know her. They would never know her. They had no<br> realization of what her life had been before she reached her<br> present safe eminence in her mansion on Peachtree Street. They<br> didn't care to talk about what their lives had been before they<br> attained stiff brocades and victorias with fine teams of horses.<br> They didn't know of her struggles, her privations, all the things<br> that made this great house and pretty clothes and silver and<br> receptions worth having. They didn't know. They didn't care,<br> these people from God-knows-where who seemed to live always on the<br> surface of things, who had no common memories of war and hunger and<br> fighting, who had no common roots going down into the same red<br> earth.<br><br> Now in her loneliness, she would have liked to while away the<br> afternoons with Maybelle or Fanny or Mrs. Elsing or Mrs. Whiting or<br> even that redoubtable old warrior, Mrs. Merriwether. Or Mrs.<br> Bonnell or--or any of her old friends and neighbors. For they<br> knew. They had known war and terror and fire, had seen dear ones<br> dead before their time; they had hungered and been ragged, had<br> lived with the wolf at the door. And they had rebuilt fortune from<br> ruin.<br><br> It would be a comfort to sit with Maybelle, remembering that<br> Maybelle had buried a baby, dead in the mad flight before Sherman.<br> There would be solace in Fanny's presence, knowing that she and<br> Fanny both had lost husbands in the black days of martial law. It<br> would be grim fun to laugh with Mrs. Elsing, recalling the old<br> lady's face as she flogged her horse through Five Points the day<br> Atlanta fell, her loot from the commissary jouncing from her<br> carriage. It would be pleasant to match stories with Mrs.<br> Merriwether, now secure on the proceeds of her bakery, pleasant to<br> say: ‘Do you remember how bad things were right after the<br> surrender? Do you remember when we didn't know where our next pair<br> of shoes was coming from? And look at us now!’<br><br> Yes, it would be pleasant. Now she understood why when two ex-<br> Confederates met, they talked of the war with so much relish, with<br> pride, with nostalgia. Those had been days that tried their hearts<br> but they had come through them. They were veterans. She was a<br> veteran too, but she had no cronies with whom she could refight old<br> battles. Oh, to be with her own kind of people again, those people<br> who had been through the same things and knew how they hurt--and<br> yet how great a part of you they were!<br><br> But, somehow, these people had slipped away. She realized that it<br> was her own fault. She had never cared until now--now that Bonnie<br> was dead and she was lonely and afraid and she saw across her<br> shining dinner table a swarthy sodden stranger disintegrating under<br> her eyes.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LXI<br><br> <br> Scarlett was in Marietta when Rhett's urgent telegram came. There<br> was a train leaving for Atlanta in ten minutes and she caught it,<br> carrying no baggage except her reticule and leaving Wade and Ella<br> at the hotel with Prissy.<br><br> Atlanta was only twenty miles away but the train crawled<br> interminably through the wet early autumn afternoon, stopping at<br> every bypath for passengers. Panic stricken at Rhett's message,<br> mad for speed, Scarlett almost screamed at every halt. Down the<br> road lumbered the train through forests faintly, tiredly gold, past<br> red hillsides still scarred with serpentine breastworks, past old<br> battery emplacements and weed-grown craters, down the road over<br> which Johnston's men had retreated so bitterly, fighting every step<br> of the way. Each station, each crossroad the conductor called was<br> the name of a battle, the site of a skirmish. Once they would have<br> stirred Scarlett to memories of terror but now she had no thought<br> for them.<br><br> Rhett's message had been:<br><br> ‘Mrs. Wilkes ill. Come home immediately.’<br><br> Twilight had fallen when the train pulled into Atlanta and a light<br> misting rain obscured the town. The gas street lamps glowed dully,<br> blobs of yellow in the fog. Rhett was waiting for her at the depot<br> with the carriage. The very sight of his face frightened her more<br> than his telegram. She had never seen it so expressionless before.<br><br> ‘She isn't--’ she cried.<br><br> ‘No. She's still alive.’ Rhett assisted her into the carriage.<br> ‘To Mrs. Wilkes' house and as fast as you can go,’ he ordered the<br> coachman.<br><br> ‘What's the matter with her? I didn't know she was ill. She<br> looked all right last week. Did she have an accident? Oh, Rhett,<br> it isn't really as serious as you--’<br><br> ‘She's dying,’ said Rhett and his voice had no more expression than<br> his face. ‘She wants to see you.’<br><br> ‘Not Melly! Oh, not Melly! What's happened to her?’<br><br> ‘She's had a miscarriage.’<br><br> ‘A--a-mis--but, Rhett, she--’ Scarlett floundered. This<br> information on top of the horror of his announcement took her<br> breath away.<br><br> ‘You did not know she was going to have a baby?’<br><br> She could not even shake her head.<br><br> ‘Ah, well. I suppose not. I don't think she told anyone. She<br> wanted it to be a surprise. But I knew.’<br><br> ‘You knew? But surely she didn't tell you!’<br><br> ‘She didn't have to tell me. I knew. She's been so--happy these<br> last two months I knew it couldn't mean anything else.’<br><br> ‘But Rhett, the doctor said it would kill her to have another<br> baby!’<br><br> ‘It has killed her,’ said Rhett. And to the coachman: ‘For God's<br> sake, can't you drive faster?’<br><br> ‘But, Rhett, she can't be dying! I--I didn't and I--’<br><br> ‘She hasn't your strength. She's never had any strength. She's<br> never had anything but heart.’<br><br> The carriage rocked to a standstill in front of the flat little<br> house and Rhett handed her out. Trembling, frightened, a sudden<br> feeling of loneliness upon her, she clasped his arm.<br><br> ‘You're coming in, Rhett?’<br><br> ‘No,’ he said and got back into the carriage.<br><br> She flew up the front steps, across the porch and threw open the<br> door. There, in the yellow lamplight were Ashley, Aunt Pitty and<br> India. Scarlett thought: ‘What's India doing here? Melanie told<br> her never to set foot in this house again.’ The three rose at the<br> sight of her, Aunt Pitty biting her trembling lips to still them,<br> India staring at her, grief stricken and without hate. Ashley<br> looked dull as a sleepwalker and, as he came to her and put his<br> hand upon her arm, he spoke like a sleepwalker.<br><br> ‘She asked for you,’ he said. ‘She asked for you.’<br><br> ‘Can I see her now?’ She turned toward the closed door of<br> Melanie's room.<br><br> ‘No. Dr. Meade is in there now. I'm glad you've come, Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘I came as quickly as I could.’ Scarlett shed her bonnet and her<br> cloak. ‘The train-- She isn't really-- Tell me, she's better,<br> isn't she, Ashley? Speak to me! Don't look like that! She isn't<br> really--’<br><br> ‘She kept asking for you,’ said Ashley and looked her in the eyes.<br> And, in his eyes she saw the answer to her question. For a moment,<br> her heart stood still and then a queer fear, stronger than anxiety,<br> stronger than grief, began to beat in her breast. It can't be<br> true, she thought vehemently, trying to push back the fear.<br> Doctors make mistakes. I won't think it's true. I can't let<br> myself think it's true. I'll scream if I do. I must think of<br> something else.<br><br> ‘I don't believe it!’ she cried stormily, looking into the three<br> drawn faces as though defying them to contradict her. ‘And why<br> didn't Melanie tell me? I'd never have gone to Marietta if I'd<br> known!’<br><br> Ashley's eyes awoke and were tormented.<br><br> ‘She didn't tell anyone, Scarlett, especially not you. She was<br> afraid you'd scold her if you knew. She wanted to wait three--till<br> she thought it safe and sure and then surprise you all and laugh<br> and say how wrong the doctors had been. And she was so happy. You<br> know how she was about babies--how much she's wanted a little girl.<br> And everything went so well until--and then for no reason at all--’<br><br> The door of Melanie's room opened quietly and Dr. Meade came out<br> into the hall, shutting the door behind him. He stood for a<br> moment, his gray beard sunk on his chest, and looked at the<br> suddenly frozen four. His gaze fell last on Scarlett. As he came<br> toward her, she saw that there was grief in his eyes and also<br> dislike and contempt that flooded her frightened heart with guilt.<br><br> ‘So you finally got here,’ he said.<br><br> Before she could answer, Ashley started toward the closed door.<br><br> ‘Not you, yet,’ said the doctor. ‘She wants to speak to Scarlett.’<br><br> ‘Doctor,’ said India, putting a hand on his sleeve. Though her<br> voice was toneless, it plead more loudly than words. ‘Let me see<br> her for a moment. I've been here since this morning, waiting, but<br> she-- Let me see her for a moment. I want to tell her--must tell<br> her--that I was wrong about--something.’<br><br> She did not look at Ashley or Scarlett as she spoke, but Dr. Meade<br> allowed his cold glance to fall on Scarlett.<br><br> ‘I'll see, Miss India,’ he said briefly. ‘But only if you'll give<br> me your word not to use up her strength telling her you were wrong.<br> She knows you were wrong and it will only worry her to hear you<br> apologize.’<br><br> Pitty began, timidly: ‘Please, Dr. Meade--’<br><br> ‘Miss Pitty, you know you'd scream and faint.’<br><br> Pitty drew up her stout little body and gave the doctor glance for<br> glance. Her eyes were dry and there was dignity in every curve.<br><br> ‘Well, all right, honey, a little later,’ said the doctor, more<br> kindly. ‘Come, Scarlett.’<br><br> They tiptoed down the hall to the closed door and the doctor put<br> his hand on Scarlett's shoulder in a hard grip.<br><br> ‘Now, Miss,’ he whispered briefly, ‘no hysterics and no deathbed<br> confessions from you or, before God, I will wring your neck! Don't<br> give me any of your innocent stares. You know what I mean. Miss<br> Melly is going to die easily and you aren't going to ease your own<br> conscience by telling her anything about Ashley. I've never harmed<br> a woman yet, but if you say anything now--you'll answer to me.’<br><br> He opened the door before she could answer, pushed her into the<br> room and closed the door behind her. The little room, cheaply<br> furnished in black walnut, was in semidarkness, the lamp shaded<br> with a newspaper. It was as small and prim a room as a<br> schoolgirl's, the narrow little low-backed bed, the plain net<br> curtains looped back, the clean faded rag rugs on the floor, were<br> so different from the lavishness of Scarlett's own bedroom with its<br> towering carved furniture, pink brocade draperies and rose-strewn<br> carpet.<br><br> Melanie lay in the bed, her figure under the counterpane shrunken<br> and flat like a little girl's. Two black braids fell on either<br> side of her face and her closed eyes were sunken in twin purple<br> circles. At the sight of her Scarlett stood transfixed, leaning<br> against the door. Despite the gloom of the room, she could see<br> that Melanie's face was of a waxy yellow color. It was drained of<br> life's blood and there was a pinched look about the nose. Until<br> that moment, Scarlett had hoped Dr. Meade was mistaken. But now<br> she knew. In the hospitals during the war she had seen too many<br> faces wearing this pinched look not to know what it inevitably<br> presaged.<br><br> Melanie was dying, but for a moment Scarlett's mind refused to take<br> it in. Melanie could not die. It was impossible for her to die.<br> God wouldn't let her die when she, Scarlett, needed her so much.<br> Never before had it occurred to her that she needed Melanie. But<br> now, the truth surged in, down to the deepest recesses of her soul.<br> She had relied on Melanie, even as she had relied upon herself, and<br> she had never known it. Now, Melanie was dying and Scarlett knew<br> she could not get along without her. Now, as she tiptoed across<br> the room toward the quiet figure, panic clutching at her heart, she<br> knew that Melanie had been her sword and her shield, her comfort<br> and her strength.<br><br> ‘I must hold her! I can't let her get away!’ she thought and sank<br> beside the bed with a rustle of skirts. Hastily she grasped the<br> limp hand lying on the coverlet and was frightened anew by its<br> chill.<br><br> ‘It's me, Melly,’ she said.<br><br> Melanie's eyes opened a slit and then, as if having satisfied<br> herself that it was really Scarlett, she closed them again. After<br> a pause she drew a breath and whispered:<br><br> ‘Promise me?’<br><br> ‘Oh, anything!’<br><br> ‘Beau--look after him.’<br><br> Scarlett could only nod, a strangled feeling in her throat, and she<br> gently pressed the hand she held by way of assent.<br><br> ‘I give him to you.’ There was the faintest trace of a smile. ‘I<br> gave him to you, once before--'member?--before he was born.’<br><br> Did she remember? Could she ever forget that time? Almost as<br> clearly as if that dreadful day had returned, she could feel the<br> stifling heat of the September noon, remembering her terror of the<br> Yankees, hear the tramp of the retreating troops, recall Melanie's<br> voice begging her to take the baby should she die--remember, too,<br> how she had hated Melanie that day and hoped that she would die.<br><br> ‘I've killed her,’ she thought, in superstitious agony. ‘I wished<br> so often she would die and God heard me and is punishing me.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Melly, don't talk like that! You know you'll pull through<br> this--’<br><br> ‘No. Promise.’<br><br> Scarlett gulped.<br><br> ‘You know I promise. I'll treat him like he was my own boy.’<br><br> ‘College?’ asked Melanie's faint flat voice.<br><br> ‘Oh, yes! The university and Harvard and Europe and anything he<br> wants--and--and--a pony--and music lessons-- Oh, please, Melly, do<br> try! Do make an effort!’<br><br> The silence fell again and on Melanie's face there were signs of a<br> struggle to gather strength to speak.<br><br> ‘Ashley,’ she said. ‘Ashley and you--’ Her voice faltered into<br> stillness.<br><br> At the mention of Ashley's name, Scarlett's heart stood still, cold<br> as granite within her. Melanie had known all the time. Scarlett<br> dropped her head on the coverlet and a sob that would not rise<br> caught her throat with a cruel hand. Melanie knew. Scarlett was<br> beyond shame now, beyond any feeling save a wild remorse that she<br> had hurt this gentle creature throughout the long years. Melanie<br> had known--and yet, she had remained her loyal friend. Oh, if she<br> could only live those years over again! She would never even let<br> her eyes meet those of Ashley.<br><br> ‘O God,’ she prayed rapidly, ‘do, please, let her live! I'll make<br> it up to her. I'll be so good to her. I'll never even speak to<br> Ashley again as long as I live, if You'll only let her get well!’<br><br> ‘Ashley,’ said Melanie feebly and her fingers reached out to touch<br> Scarlett's bowed head. Her thumb and forefinger tugged with no<br> more strength than that of a baby at Scarlett's hair. Scarlett<br> knew what that meant, knew Melanie wanted her to look up. But she<br> could not, could not meet Melanie's eyes and read that knowledge in<br> them.<br><br> ‘Ashley,’ Melanie whispered again and Scarlett gripped herself.<br> When she looked God in the face on the Day of Judgment and read her<br> sentence in His eyes, it would not be as bad as this. Her soul<br> cringed but she raised her head.<br><br> She saw only the same dark loving eyes, sunken and drowsy with<br> death, the same tender mouth tiredly fighting pain for breath. No<br> reproach was there, no accusation and no fear--only an anxiety that<br> she might not find strength for words.<br><br> For a moment Scarlett was too stunned to even feel relief. Then,<br> as she held Melanie's hand more closely, a flood of warm gratitude<br> to God swept over her and, for the first time since her childhood,<br> she said a humble, unselfish prayer.<br><br> ‘Thank You, God. I know I'm not worth it but thank You for not<br> letting her know.’<br><br> ‘What about Ashley, Melly?’<br><br> ‘You'll--look after him?’<br><br> ‘Oh, yes.’<br><br> ‘He catches cold--so easily.’<br><br> There was a pause.<br><br> ‘Look after--his business--you understand?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I understand. I will.’<br><br> She made a great effort.<br><br> ‘Ashley isn't--practical.’<br><br> Only death could have forced that disloyalty from Melanie.<br><br> ‘Look after him, Scarlett--but--don't ever let him know.’<br><br> ‘I'll look after him and the business too, and I'll never let him<br> know. I'll just kind of suggest things to him.’<br><br> Melanie managed a small smile but it was a triumphant one as her<br> eyes met Scarlett's again. Their glance sealed the bargain that<br> the protection of Ashley Wilkes from a too harsh world was passing<br> from one woman to another and that Ashley's masculine pride should<br> never be humbled by this knowledge.<br><br> Now the struggle went out of the tired face as though with<br> Scarlett's promise, ease had come to her.<br><br> ‘You're so smart--so brave--always been so good to me--’<br><br> At these words, the sob came freely to Scarlett's throat and she<br> clapped her hand over her mouth. Now, she was going to bawl like a<br> child and cry out: ‘I've been a devil! I've wronged you so! I<br> never did anything for you! It was all for Ashley.’<br><br> She rose to her feet abruptly, sinking her teeth into her thumb to<br> regain her control. Rhett's words came back to her again, ‘She<br> loves you. Let that be your cross.’ Well, the cross was heavier<br> now. It was bad enough that she had tried by every art to take<br> Ashley from her. But now it was worse that Melanie, who had<br> trusted her blindly through life, was laying the same love and<br> trust on her in death. No, she could not speak. She could not<br> even say again: ‘Make an effort to live.’ She must let her go<br> easily, without a struggle, without tears, without sorrow.<br><br> The door opened slightly and Dr. Meade stood on the threshold,<br> beckoning imperiously. Scarlett bent over the bed, choking back<br> her tears and taking Melanie's hand, laid it against her cheek.<br><br> ‘Good night,’ she said, and her voice was steadier than she thought<br> it possibly could be.<br><br> ‘Promise me--’ came the whisper, very softly now.<br><br> ‘Anything, darling.’<br><br> ‘Captain Butler--be kind to him. He--loves you so.’<br><br> ‘Rhett?’ thought Scarlett, bewildered, and the words meant nothing<br> to her.<br><br> ‘Yes, indeed,’ she said automatically and, pressing a light kiss on<br> the hand, laid it back on the bed.<br><br> ‘Tell the ladies to come in immediately,’ whispered the doctor as<br> she passed through the door.<br><br> Through blurred eyes she saw India and Pitty follow the doctor into<br> the room, holding their skirts close to their sides to keep them<br> from rustling. The door closed behind them and the house was<br> still. Ashley was nowhere to be seen. Scarlett leaned her head<br> against the wall, like a naughty child in a corner, and rubbed her<br> aching throat.<br><br> Behind that door, Melanie was going and, with her, the strength<br> upon which she had relied unknowingly for so many years. Why, oh,<br> why, had she not realized before this how much she loved and needed<br> Melanie? But who would have thought of small plain Melanie as a<br> tower of strength? Melanie who was shy to tears before strangers,<br> timid about raising her voice in an opinion of her own, fearful of<br> the disapproval of old ladies, Melanie who lacked the courage to<br> say Boo to a goose? And yet--<br><br> Scarlett's mind went back through the years to the still, hot noon<br> at Tara when gray smoke curled above a blue-clad body and Melanie<br> stood at the top of the stairs with Charles' saber in her hand.<br> Scarlett remembered that she had thought at the time: ‘How silly!<br> Melly couldn't even heft that sword!’ But now she knew that had<br> the necessity arisen, Melanie would have charged down those stairs<br> and killed the Yankee--or been killed herself.<br><br> Yes, Melanie had been there that day with a sword in her small<br> hand, ready to do battle for her. And now, as Scarlett looked<br> sadly back, she realized that Melanie had always been there beside<br> her with a sword in her hand, unobtrusive as her own shadow, loving<br> her, fighting for her with blind passionate loyalty, fighting<br> Yankees, fire, hunger, poverty, public opinion and even her beloved<br> blood kin.<br><br> Scarlett felt her courage and self-confidence ooze from her as she<br> realized that the sword which had flashed between her and the world<br> was sheathed forever.<br><br> ‘Melly is the only woman friend I ever had,’ she thought forlornly,<br> ‘the only woman except Mother who really loved me. She's like<br> Mother, too. Everyone who knew her has clung to her skirts.’<br><br> Suddenly it was as if Ellen were lying behind that closed door,<br> leaving the world for a second time. Suddenly she was standing at<br> Tara again with the world about her ears, desolate with the<br> knowledge that she could not face life without the terrible<br> strength of the weak, the gentle, the tender hearted.<br><br> <br><br> She stood in the hall, irresolute, frightened, and the glaring<br> light of the fire in the sitting room threw tall dim shadows on the<br> walls about her. The house was utterly still and the stillness<br> soaked into her like a fine chill rain. Ashley! Where was Ashley?<br><br> She went toward the sitting room seeking him like a cold animal<br> seeking the fire but he was not there. She must find him. She had<br> discovered Melanie's strength and her dependence on it only to lose<br> it in the moment of discovery but there was still Ashley left.<br> There was Ashley who was strong and wise and comforting. In Ashley<br> and his love lay strength upon which to lay her weakness, courage<br> to bolster her fear, ease for her sorrow.<br><br> He must be in his room, she thought, and tiptoeing down the hall,<br> she knocked softly. There was no answer, so she pushed the door<br> open. Ashley was standing in front of the dresser, looking at a<br> pair of Melanie's mended gloves. First he picked up one and looked<br> at it, as though he had never seen it before. Then he laid it down<br> gently, as though it were made of glass, and picked up the other<br> one.<br><br> She said: ‘Ashley!’ in a trembling voice and he turned slowly and<br> looked at her. The drowsy aloofness had gone from his gray eyes<br> and they were wide and unmasked. In them she saw fear that matched<br> her own fear, helplessness weaker than her own, bewilderment more<br> profound than she would ever know. The feeling of dread which had<br> possessed her in the hall deepened as she saw his face. She went<br> toward him.<br><br> ‘I'm frightened,’ she said. ‘Oh, Ashley, hold me. I'm so<br> frightened!’<br><br> He made no move to her but stared, gripping the glove tightly in<br> both hands. She put a hand on his arm and whispered: ‘What is<br> it?’<br><br> His eyes searched her intently, hunting, hunting desperately for<br> something he did not find. Finally he spoke and his voice was not<br> his own.<br><br> ‘I was wanting you,’ he said. ‘I was going to run and find you--<br> run like a child wanting comfort--and I find a child, more<br> frightened, running to me.’<br><br> ‘Not you--you can't be frightened,’ she cried. ‘Nothing has ever<br> frightened you. But I-- You've always been so strong--’<br><br> ‘If I've ever been strong, it was because she was behind me,’ he<br> said, his voice breaking, and he looked down at the glove and<br> smoothed the fingers. ‘And--and--all the strength I ever had is<br> going with her.’<br><br> There was such a note of wild despair in his low voice that she<br> dropped her hand from his arm and stepped back. And in the heavy<br> silence that fell between them, she felt that she really understood<br> him for the first time in her life.<br><br> ‘Why--’ she said slowly, ‘why, Ashley, you love her, don't you?’<br><br> He spoke as with an effort.<br><br> ‘She is the only dream I ever had that lived and breathed and did<br> not die in the face of reality.’<br><br> ‘Dreams!’ she thought, an old irritation stirring. ‘Always dreams<br> with him! Never common sense!’<br><br> With a heart that was heavy and a little bitter, she said: ‘You've<br> been such a fool, Ashley. Why couldn't you see that she was worth<br> a million of me?’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, please! If you only knew what I've gone through since<br> the doctor--’<br><br> ‘What you've gone through! Don't you think that I-- Oh, Ashley,<br> you should have known, years ago, that you loved her and not me!<br> Why didn't you! Everything would have been so different, so-- Oh,<br> you should have realized and not kept me dangling with all your<br> talk about honor and sacrifice! If you'd told me, years ago, I'd<br> have-- It would have killed me but I could have stood it somehow.<br> But you wait till now, till Melly's dying, to find it out and now<br> it's too late to do anything. Oh, Ashley, men are supposed to know<br> such things--not women! You should have seen so clearly that you<br> loved her all the time and only wanted me like--like Rhett wants<br> that Watling woman!’<br><br> He winced at her words but his eyes still met hers, imploring<br> silence, comfort. Every line of his face admitted the truth of her<br> words. The very droop of his shoulders showed that his own self-<br> castigation was more cruel than any she could give. He stood<br> silent before her, clutching the glove as though it were an<br> understanding hand and, in the stillness that followed her words,<br> her indignation fell away and pity, tinged with contempt, took its<br> place. Her conscience smote her. She was kicking a beaten and<br> defenseless man--and she had promised Melanie that she would look<br> after him.<br><br> ‘And just as soon as I promised her, I said mean, hurting things to<br> him and there's no need for me to say them or for anyone to say<br> them. He knows the truth and it's killing him,’ she thought<br> desolately. ‘He's not grown up. He's a child, like me, and he's<br> sick with fear at losing her. Melly knew how it would be--Melly<br> knew him far better than I do. That's why she said look after him<br> and Beau, in the same breath. How can Ashley ever stand this? I<br> can stand it. I can stand anything. I've had to stand so much.<br> But he can't--he can't stand anything without her.’<br><br> ‘Forgive me, darling,’ she said gently, putting out her arms. ‘I<br> know what you must be suffering. But remember, she doesn't know<br> anything--she never even suspected-- God was that good to us.’<br><br> He came to her quickly and his arms went round her blindly. She<br> tiptoed to bring her warm cheek comfortingly against his and with<br> one hand she smoothed the back of his hair.<br><br> ‘Don't cry, sweet. She'd want you to be brave. She'll want to see<br> you in a moment and you must be brave. She mustn't see that you've<br> been crying. It would worry her.’<br><br> He held her in a grip that made breathing difficult and his choking<br> voice was in her ear.<br><br> ‘What will I do? I can't--I can't live without her!’<br><br> ‘I can't either,’ she thought, shuddering away from the picture of<br> the long years to come, without Melanie. But she caught herself in<br> a strong grasp. Ashley was depending on her, Melanie was depending<br> on her. As once before, in the moonlight at Tara, drunk, exhausted,<br> she had thought: ‘Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry<br> them.’ Well, her shoulders were strong and Ashley's were not. She<br> squared her shoulders for the load and with a calmness she was far<br> from feeling, kissed his wet cheek without fever or longing or<br> passion, only with cool gentleness.<br><br> ‘We shall manage--somehow,’ she said.<br><br> A door opened with sudden violence into the hall and Dr. Meade<br> called with sharp urgency:<br><br> ‘Ashley! Quick!’<br><br> ‘My God! She's gone!’ thought Scarlett. ‘And Ashley didn't get to<br> tell her good-by! But maybe--’<br><br> ‘Hurry!’ she cried aloud, giving him a push, for he stood staring<br> like one stunned. ‘Hurry!’<br><br> She pulled open the door and motioned him through. Galvanized by<br> her words, he ran into the hall, the glove still clasped closely in<br> his hand. She heard his rapid steps for a moment and then the<br> closing of a door.<br><br> She said, ‘My God!’ again and walking slowly to the bed, sat down<br> upon it and dropped her head in her hands. She was suddenly tired,<br> more tired than she had ever been in all her life. With the sound<br> of the closing door, the strain under which she had been laboring,<br> the strain which had given her strength, suddenly snapped. She<br> felt exhausted in body and drained of emotions. Now she felt no<br> sorrow or remorse, no fear or amazement. She was tired and her<br> mind ticked away dully, mechanically, as the clock on the mantel.<br><br> Out of the dullness, one thought arose. Ashley did not love her<br> and had never really loved her and the knowledge did not hurt. It<br> should hurt. She should be desolate, broken hearted, ready to<br> scream at fate. She had relied upon his love for so long. It had<br> upheld her through so many dark places. Yet, there the truth was.<br> He did not love her and she did not care. She did not care because<br> she did not love him. She did not love him and so nothing he could<br> do or say could hurt her.<br><br> She lay down on the bed and put her head on the pillow tiredly.<br> Useless to try to combat the idea, useless to say to herself: ‘But<br> I do love him. I've loved him for years. Love can't change to<br> apathy in a minute.’<br><br> But it could change and it had changed.<br><br> ‘He never really existed at all, except in my imagination,’ she<br> thought wearily. ‘I loved something I made up, something that's<br> just as dead as Melly is. I made a pretty suit of clothes and fell<br> in love with it. And when Ashley came riding along, so handsome,<br> so different, I put that suit on him and made him wear it whether<br> it fitted him or not. And I wouldn't see what he really was. I<br> kept on loving the pretty clothes--and not him at all.’<br><br> Now she could look back down the long years and see herself in<br> green flowered dimity, standing in the sunshine at Tara, thrilled<br> by the young horseman with his blond hair shining like a silver<br> helmet. She could see so clearly now that he was only a childish<br> fancy, no more important really than her spoiled desire for the<br> aquamarine earbobs she had coaxed out of Gerald. For, once she<br> owned the earbobs, they had lost their value, as everything except<br> money lost its value once it was hers. And so he, too, would have<br> become cheap if, in those first far-away days, she had ever had the<br> satisfaction of refusing to marry him. If she had ever had him at<br> her mercy, seen him grown passionate, importunate, jealous, sulky,<br> pleading, like the other boys, the wild infatuation which had<br> possessed her would have passed, blowing away as lightly as mist<br> before sunshine and light wind when she met a new man.<br><br> ‘What a fool I've been,’ she thought bitterly. ‘And now I've got<br> to pay for it. What I've wished for so often has happened. I've<br> wished Melly was dead so I could have him. And now she's dead and<br> I've got him and I don't want him. His damned honor will make him<br> ask me if I want to divorce Rhett and marry him. Marry him? I<br> wouldn't have him on a silver platter! But, just the same I've got<br> him round my neck for the rest of my life. As long as I live I'll<br> have to look after him and see that he doesn't starve and that<br> people don't hurt his feelings. He'll be just another child,<br> clinging to my skirts. I've lost my lover and I've got another<br> child. And if I hadn't promised Melly, I'd--I wouldn't care if I<br> never saw him again.’<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LXII<br><br> <br> She heard whispering voices outside, and going to the door she saw<br> the frightened negroes standing in the back hall, Dilcey with her<br> arms sagging under the heavy weight of the sleeping Beau, Uncle<br> Peter crying, and Cookie wiping her wide wet face on her apron.<br> All three looked at her, dumbly asking what they were to do now.<br> She looked up the hall toward the sitting room and saw India and<br> Aunt Pitty standing speechless, holding each other's hands and, for<br> once, India had lost her stiff-necked look. Like the negroes, they<br> looked imploringly at her, expecting her to give instructions. She<br> walked into the sitting room and the two women closed about her.<br><br> ‘Oh, Scarlett, what--’ began Aunt Pitty, her fat, child's mouth<br> shaking.<br><br> ‘Don't speak to me or I'll scream,’ said Scarlett. Overwrought<br> nerves brought sharpness to her voice and her hands clenched at her<br> sides. The thought of speaking of Melanie now, of making the<br> inevitable arrangements that follow a death made her throat<br> tighten. ‘I don't want a word out of either of you.’<br><br> At the authoritative note in her voice, they fell back, helpless<br> hurt looks on their faces. ‘I mustn't cry in front of them,’ she<br> thought. ‘I mustn't break now or they'll begin crying too, and<br> then the darkies will begin screaming and we'll all go mad. I must<br> pull myself together. There's so much I'll have to do. See the<br> undertaker and arrange the funeral and see that the house is clean<br> and be here to talk to people who'll cry on my neck. Ashley can't<br> do them. I've got to do them. Oh, what a weary load! It's always<br> been a weary load and always some one else's load!’<br><br> She looked at the dazed hurt faces of India and Pitty and<br> contrition swept her. Melanie would not like her to be so sharp<br> with those who loved her.<br><br> ‘I'm sorry I was cross,’ she said, speaking with difficulty. ‘It's<br> just that I--I'm sorry I was cross, Auntie. I'm going out on the<br> porch for a minute. I've got to be alone. Then I'll come back and<br> we'll--’<br><br> She patted Aunt Pitty and went swiftly by her to the front door,<br> knowing if she stayed in this room another minute her control would<br> crack. She had to be alone. And she had to cry or her heart would<br> break.<br><br> She stepped onto the dark porch and closed the door behind her and<br> the moist night air was cool upon her face. The rain had ceased<br> and there was no sound except for the occasional drip of water from<br> the eaves. The world was wrapped in a thick mist, a faintly chill<br> mist that bore on its breath the smell of the dying year. All the<br> houses across the street were dark except one, and the light from a<br> lamp in the window, falling into the street, struggled feebly with<br> the fog, golden particles floating in its rays. It was as if the<br> whole world were enveloped in an unmoving blanket of gray smoke.<br> And the whole world was still.<br><br> She leaned her head against one of the uprights of the porch and<br> prepared to cry but no tears came. This was a calamity too deep<br> for tears. Her body shook. There still reverberated in her mind<br> the crashes of the two impregnable citadels of her life, thundering<br> to dust about her ears. She stood for a while, trying to summon up<br> her old charm: ‘I'll think of all this tomorrow when I can stand<br> it better.’ But the charm had lost its potency. She had to think<br> of two things, now--Melanie and how much she loved and needed her;<br> Ashley and the obstinate blindness that had made her refuse to see<br> him as he really was. And she knew that thoughts of them would<br> hurt just as much tomorrow and all the tomorrows of her life.<br><br> ‘I can't go back in there and talk to them now,’ she thought. ‘I<br> can't face Ashley tonight and comfort him. Not tonight! Tomorrow<br> morning I'll come early and do the things I must do, say the<br> comforting things I must say. But not tonight. I can't. I'm<br> going home.’<br><br> Home was only five blocks away. She would not wait for the sobbing<br> Peter to harness the buggy, would not wait for Dr. Meade to drive<br> her home. She could not endure the tears of the one, the silent<br> condemnation of the other. She went swiftly down the dark front<br> steps without her coat or bonnet and into the misty night. She<br> rounded the corner and started up the long hill toward Peachree<br> Street, walking in a still wet world, and even her footsteps were<br> as noiseless as a dream.<br><br> As she went up the hill, her chest tight with tears that would not<br> come, there crept over her an unreal feeling, a feeling that she<br> had been in this same dim chill place before, under a like set of<br> circumstances--not once but many times before. How silly, she<br> thought uneasily, quickening her steps. Her nerves were playing<br> her tricks. But the feeling persisted, stealthily pervading her<br> mind. She peered about her uncertainly and the feeling grew, eerie<br> but familiar, and her head went up sharply like an animal scenting<br> danger. It's just that I'm worn out, she tried to soothe herself.<br> And the night's so queer, so misty. I never saw such thick mist<br> before except--except!<br><br> And then she knew and fear squeezed her heart. She knew now. In a<br> hundred nightmares, she had fled through fog like this, through a<br> haunted country without landmarks, thick with cold cloaking mist,<br> peopled with clutching ghosts and shadows. Was she dreaming again<br> or was this her dream come true?<br><br> For an instant, reality went out of her and she was lost. The old<br> nightmare feeling was sweeping her, stronger than ever, and her<br> heart began to race. She was standing again amid death and<br> stillness, even as she had once stood at Tara. All that mattered<br> in the world had gone out of it, life was in ruins and panic howled<br> through her heart like a cold wind. The horror that was in the<br> mist and was the mist laid hands upon her. And she began to run.<br> As she had run a hundred times in dreams, she ran now, flying<br> blindly she knew not where, driven by a nameless dread, seeking in<br> the gray mist for the safety that lay somewhere.<br><br> Up the dim street she fled, her head down, her heart hammering, the<br> night air wet on her lips, the trees overhead menacing. Somewhere,<br> somewhere in this wild land of moist stillness, there was a refuge!<br> She sped gasping up the long hill, her wet skirts wrapping coldly<br> about her ankles, her lungs bursting, the tight-laced stays<br> pressing her ribs into her heart.<br><br> Then before her eyes there loomed a light, a row of lights, dim and<br> flickering but none the less real. In her nightmare, there had<br> never been any lights, only gray fog. Her mind seized on those<br> lights. Lights meant safety, people, reality. Suddenly she<br> stopped running, her hands clenching, struggling to pull herself<br> out of her panic, staring intently at the row of gas lamps which<br> had signaled to her brain that this was Peachtree Street, Atlanta,<br> and not the gray world of sleep and ghosts.<br><br> She sank down panting on a carriage block, clutching at her nerves<br> as though they were ropes slipping swiftly through her hands.<br><br> ‘I was running--running like a crazy person!’ she thought, her body<br> shaking with lessening fear, her thudding heart making her sick.<br> ‘But where was I running?’<br><br> Her breath came more easily now and she sat with her hand pressed<br> to her side and looked up Peachtree Street. There, at the top of<br> the hill, was her own house. It looked as though every window bore<br> lights, lights defying the mist to dim their brilliance. Home! It<br> was real! She looked at the dim far-off bulk of the house<br> thankfully, longingly, and something like calm fell on her spirit.<br><br> Home! That was where she wanted to go. That was where she was<br> running. Home to Rhett!<br><br> At this realization it was as though chains fell away from her and<br> with them the fear which had haunted her dreams since the night she<br> stumbled to Tara to find the world ended. At the end of the road<br> to Tara she had found security gone, all strength, all wisdom, all<br> loving tenderness, all understanding gone--all those things which,<br> embodied in Ellen, had been the bulwark of her girlhood. And,<br> though she had won material safety since that night, in her dreams<br> she was still a frightened child, searching for the lost security<br> of that lost world.<br><br> Now she knew the haven she had sought in dreams, the place of warm<br> safety which had always been hidden from her in the mist. It was<br> not Ashley--oh, never Ashley! There was no more warmth in him than<br> in a marsh light, no more security than in quicksand. It was<br> Rhett--Rhett who had strong arms to hold her, a broad chest to<br> pillow her tired head, jeering laughter to pull her affairs into<br> proper perspective. And complete understanding, because he, like<br> her, saw truth as truth, unobstructed by impractical notions of<br> honor, sacrifice, or high belief in human nature. He loved her!<br> Why hadn't she realized that he loved her, for all his taunting<br> remarks to the contrary? Melanie had seen it and with her last<br> breath had said, ‘Be kind to him.’<br><br> ‘Oh,’ she thought, ‘Ashley's not the only stupidly blind person. I<br> should have seen.’<br><br> For years she had had her back against the stone wall of Rhett's<br> love and had taken it as much for granted as she had taken<br> Melanie's love, flattering herself that she drew her strength from<br> herself alone. And even as she had realized earlier in the evening<br> that Melanie bad been beside her in her bitter campaigns against<br> life, now she knew that silent in the background, Rhett had stood,<br> loving her, understanding her, ready to help. Rhett at the bazaar,<br> reading her impatience in her eyes and leading her out in the reel,<br> Rhett helping her out of the bondage of mourning, Rhett convoying<br> her through the fire and explosions the night Atlanta fell, Rhett<br> lending her the money that gave her her start, Rhett who comforted<br> her when she woke in the nights crying with fright from her dreams--<br> why, no man did such things without loving a woman to distraction!<br><br> The trees dripped dampness upon her but she did not feel it. The<br> mist swirled about her and she paid it no heed. For when she<br> thought of Rhett, with his swarthy face, flashing teeth and dark<br> alert eyes, a trembling came over her.<br><br> ‘I love him,’ she thought and, as always, she accepted the truth<br> with little wonder, as a child accepting a gift. ‘I don't know how<br> long I've loved him but it's true. And if it hadn't been for<br> Ashley, I'd have realized it long ago. I've never been able to see<br> the world at all, because Ashley stood in the way.’<br><br> She loved him, scamp, blackguard, without scruple or honor--at<br> least, honor as Ashley saw it. ‘Damn Ashley's honor!’ she thought.<br> ‘Ashley's honor has always let me down. Yes, from the very<br> beginning when he kept on coming to see me, even though he knew his<br> family expected him to marry Melanie. Rhett has never let me down,<br> even that dreadful night of Melly's reception when he ought to have<br> wrung my neck. Even when he left me on the road the night Atlanta<br> fell, he knew I'd be safe. He knew I'd get through somehow. Even<br> when he acted like he was going to make me pay to get that money<br> from him at the Yankee camp. He wouldn't have taken me. He was<br> just testing me. He's loved me all along and I've been so mean to<br> him. Time and again, I've hurt him and he was too proud to show<br> it. And when Bonnie died-- Oh, how could I?’<br><br> She stood up straight and looked at the house on the hill. She had<br> thought, half an hour ago, that she had lost everything in the<br> world, except money, everything that made life desirable, Ellen,<br> Gerald, Bonnie, Mammy, Melanie and Ashley. She had to lose them<br> all to realize that she loved Rhett--loved him because he was<br> strong and unscrupulous, passionate and earthy, like herself.<br><br> ‘I'll tell him everything,’ she thought. ‘He'll understand. He's<br> always understood. I'll tell him what a fool I've been and how<br> much I love him and I'll make it up to him.’<br><br> Suddenly she felt strong and happy. She was not afraid of the<br> darkness or the fog and she knew with a singing in her heart that<br> she would never fear them again. No matter what mists might curl<br> around her in the future, she knew her refuge. She started briskly<br> up the street toward home and the blocks seemed very long. Far,<br> far too long. She caught up her skirts to her knees and began to<br> run lightly. But this time she was not running from fear. She was<br> running because Rhett's arms were at the end of the street.<br><br> <br><br> CHAPTER LXIII<br><br> <br> The front door was slightly ajar and she trotted, breathless, into<br> the hall and paused for a moment under the rainbow prisms of the<br> chandelier. For all its brightness the house was very still, not<br> with the serene stillness of sleep but with a watchful, tired<br> silence that was faintly ominous. She saw at a glance that Rhett<br> was not in the parlor or the library and her heart sank. Suppose<br> he should be out--out with Belle or wherever it was he spent the<br> many evenings when he did not appear at the supper table? She had<br> not bargained on this.<br><br> She had started up the steps in search of him when she saw that the<br> door of the dining room was closed. Her heart contracted a little<br> with shame at the sight of that closed door, remembering the many<br> nights of this last summer when Rhett had sat there alone, drinking<br> until he was sodden and Pork came to urge him to bed. That had<br> been her fault but she'd change it all. Everything was to be<br> different from now on--but, please God, don't let him be too drunk<br> tonight. If he's too drunk he won't believe me and he'll laugh at<br> me and that will break my heart.<br><br> She quietly opened the dining-room door a crack and peered in. He<br> was seated before the table, slumped in his chair, and a full<br> decanter stood before him with the stopper in place, the glass<br> unused. Thank God, he was sober! She pulled open the door,<br> holding herself back from running to him. But when he looked up at<br> her, something in his gaze stopped her dead on the threshold,<br> stilled the words on her lips.<br><br> He looked at her steadily with dark eyes that were heavy with<br> fatigue and there was no leaping light in them. Though her hair<br> was tumbling about her shoulders, her bosom heaving breathlessly<br> and her skirts mud splattered to the knees, his face did not change<br> with surprise or question or his lips twist with mockery. He was<br> sunken in his chair, his suit wrinkling untidily against his<br> thickening waist, every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine<br> body and the coarsening of a strong face. Drink and dissipation<br> had done their work on the coin-clean profile and now it was no<br> longer the head of a young pagan prince on new-minted gold but a<br> decadent, tired Caesar on copper debased by long usage. He looked<br> up at her as she stood there, hand on heart, looked quietly, almost<br> in a kindly way, that frightened her.<br><br> ‘Come and sit down,’ he said. ‘She is dead?’<br><br> She nodded and advanced hesitantly toward him, uncertainty taking<br> form in her mind at this new expression on his face. Without<br> rising, he pushed back a chair with his foot and she sank into it.<br> She wished he had not spoken of Melanie so soon. She did not want<br> to talk of her now, to re-live the agony of the last hour. There<br> was all the rest of her life in which to speak of Melanie. But it<br> seemed to her now, driven by a fierce desire to cry: ‘I love you,’<br> that there was only this night, this hour, in which to tell Rhett<br> what was in her mind. But there was something in his face that<br> stopped her and she was suddenly ashamed to speak of love when<br> Melanie was hardly cold.<br><br> ‘Well, God rest her,’ he said heavily. ‘She was the only completely<br> kind person I ever knew.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett!’ she cried miserably, for his words brought up too<br> vividly all the kind things Melanie had ever done for her. ‘Why<br> didn't you come in with me? It was dreadful--and I needed you so!’<br><br> ‘I couldn't have borne it,’ he said simply and for a moment he was<br> silent. Then he spoke with an effort and said, softly: ‘A very<br> great lady.’<br><br> His somber gaze went past her and in his eyes was the same look she<br> had seen in the light of the flames the night Atlanta fell, when he<br> told her he was going off with the retreating army--the surprise of<br> a man who knows himself utterly, yet discovers in himself<br> unexpected loyalties and emotions and feels a faint self-ridicule<br> at the discovery.<br><br> His moody eyes went over her shoulder as though he saw Melanie<br> silently passing through the room to the door. In the look of<br> farewell on his face there was no sorrow, no pain, only a<br> speculative wonder at himself, only a poignant stirring of emotions<br> dead since boyhood, as he said again: ‘A very great lady.’<br><br> Scarlett shivered and the glow went from her heart, the fine<br> warmth, the splendor which had sent her home on winged feet. She<br> half-grasped what was in Rhett's mind as he said farewell to the<br> only person in the world he respected and she was desolate again<br> with a terrible sense of loss that was no longer personal. She<br> could not wholly understand or analyze what he was feeling, but it<br> seemed almost as if she too had been brushed by whispering skirts,<br> touching her softly in a last caress. She was seeing through<br> Rhett's eyes the passing, not of a woman but of a legend--the<br> gentle, self-effacing but steel-spined women on whom the South had<br> builded its house in war and to whose proud and loving arms it had<br> returned in defeat.<br><br> His eyes came back to her and his voice changed. Now it was light<br> and cool.<br><br> ‘So she's dead. That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?’<br><br> ‘Oh, how can you say such things,’ she cried, stung, the quick<br> tears coming to her eyes. ‘You know how I loved her!’<br><br> ‘No, I can't say I did. Most unexpected and it's to your credit,<br> considering your passion for white trash, that you could appreciate<br> her at last.’<br><br> ‘How can you talk so? Of course I appreciated her! You didn't.<br> You didn't know her like I did! It isn't in you to understand her--<br> how good she was--’<br><br> ‘Indeed? Perhaps not.’<br><br> ‘She thought of everybody except herself--why, her last words were<br> about you.’<br><br> There was a flash of genuine feeling in his eyes as he turned to<br> her.<br><br> ‘What did she say?’<br><br> ‘Oh, not now, Rhett.’<br><br> ‘Tell me.’<br><br> His voice was cool but the hand he put on her wrist hurt. She did<br> not want to tell, this was not the way she had intended to lead up<br> to the subject of her love but his hand was urgent.<br><br> ‘She said--she said-- 'Be kind to Captain Butler. He loves you so<br> much.'‘<br><br> He stared at her and dropped her wrist. His eyelids went down,<br> leaving his face dark and blank. Suddenly he rose and going to the<br> window, he drew the curtains and looked out intently as if there<br> were something to see outside except blinding mist.<br><br> ‘Did she say anything else?’ he questioned, not turning his head.<br><br> ‘She asked me to take care of little Beau and I said I would, like<br> he was my own boy.’<br><br> ‘What else?’<br><br> ‘She said--Ashley--she asked me to look after Ashley, too.’<br><br> He was silent for a moment and then he laughed softly. ‘It's<br> convenient to have the first wife's permission, isn't it?’<br><br> ‘What do you mean?’<br><br> He turned and even in her confusion she was surprised that there<br> was no mockery in his face. Nor was there any more interest in it<br> than in the face of a man watching the last act of a none-too-<br> amusing comedy.<br><br> ‘I think my meaning's plain enough. Miss Melly is dead. You<br> certainly have all the evidence you want to divorce me and you<br> haven't enough reputation left for a divorce to hurt you. And you<br> haven't any religion left, so the Church won't matter. Then--<br> Ashley and dreams come true with the blessings of Miss Melly.’<br><br> ‘Divorce?’ she cried. ‘No! No!’ Incoherent for a moment she<br> leaped to her feet and running to him caught his arm. ‘Oh, you're<br> all wrong! Terribly wrong. I don't want a divorce--I--’ She<br> stopped for she could find no other words.<br><br> He put his hand under her chin, quietly turned her face up to the<br> light and looked for an intent moment into her eyes. She looked up<br> at him, her heart in her eyes, her lips quivering as she tried to<br> speak. But she could marshal no words because she was trying to<br> find in his face some answering emotions, some leaping light of<br> hope, of joy. Surely he must know, now! But the smooth dark<br> blankness which had baffled her so often was all that her frantic,<br> searching eyes could find. He dropped her chin and, turning,<br> walked back to his chair and sprawled tiredly again, his chin on<br> his breast, his eyes looking up at her from under black brows in an<br> impersonal speculative way.<br><br> She followed him back to his chair, her hands twisting, and stood<br> before him.<br><br> ‘You are wrong,’ she began again, finding words. ‘Rhett, tonight,<br> when I knew, I ran every step of the way home to tell you. Oh,<br> darling, I--’<br><br> ‘You are tired,’ he said, still watching her. ‘You'd better go to<br> bed.’<br><br> ‘But I must tell you!’<br><br> ‘Scarlett,’ he said heavily, ‘I don't want to hear--anything.’<br><br> ‘But you don't know what I'm going to say!’<br><br> ‘My pet, it's written plainly on your face. Something, someone has<br> made you realize that the unfortunate Mr. Wilkes is too large a<br> mouthful of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew. And that same<br> something has suddenly set my charms before you in a new and<br> attractive light,’ he sighed slightly. ‘And it's no use to talk<br> about it.’<br><br> She drew a sharp surprised breath. Of course, he had always read<br> her easily. Heretofore she had resented it but now, after the<br> first shock at her own transparency, her heart rose with gladness<br> and relief. He knew, he understood and her task was miraculously<br> made easy. No use to talk about it! Of course he was bitter at<br> her long neglect, of course he was mistrustful of her sudden<br> turnabout. She would have to woo him with kindness, convince him<br> with a rich outpouring of love, and what a pleasure it would be to<br> do it!<br><br> ‘Darling, I'm going to tell you everything,’ she said, putting her<br> hands on the arm of his chair and leaning down to him. ‘I've been<br> so wrong, such a stupid fool--’<br><br> ‘Scarlett, don't go on with this. Don't be humble before me. I<br> can't bear it. Leave us some dignity, some reticence to remember<br> out of our marriage. Spare us this last.’<br><br> She straightened up abruptly. Spare us this last? What did he<br> mean by ‘this last’? Last? This was their first, their beginning.<br><br> ‘But I will tell you,’ she began rapidly, as if fearing his hand<br> upon her mouth, silencing her. ‘Oh, Rhett, I love you so, darling!<br> I must have loved you for years and I was such a fool I didn't know<br> it. Rhett, you must believe me!’<br><br> He looked at her, standing before him, for a moment, a long look<br> that went to the back of her mind. She saw there was belief in his<br> eyes but little interest. Oh, was he going to be mean, at this of<br> all times? To torment her, pay her back in her own coin?<br><br> ‘Oh, I believe you,’ he said at last. ‘But what of Ashley Wilkes?’<br><br> ‘Ashley!’ she said, and made an impatient gesture. ‘I--I don't<br> believe I've cared anything about him for ages. It was--well, a<br> sort of habit I hung onto from when I was a little girl. Rhett,<br> I'd never even thought I cared about him if I'd ever known what he<br> was really like. He's such a helpless, poor-spirited creature, for<br> all his prattle about truth and honor and--’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Rhett. ‘If you must see him as he really is, see him<br> straight. He's only a gentleman caught in a world he doesn't<br> belong in, trying to make a poor best of it by the rules of the<br> world that's gone.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett, don't let's talk of him! What does he matter now?<br> Aren't you glad to know-- I mean, now that I--’<br><br> As his tired eyes met hers, she broke off in embarrassment, shy as<br> a girl with her first beau. If he'd only make it easier for her!<br> If only he would hold out his arms, so she could crawl thankfully<br> into his lap and lay her head on his chest. Her lips on his could<br> tell him better than all her stumbling words. But as she looked at<br> him, she realized that he was not holding her off just to be mean.<br> He looked drained and as though nothing she had said was of any<br> moment.<br><br> ‘Glad?’ he said. ‘Once I would have thanked God, fasting, to hear<br> you say all this. But, now, it doesn't matter.’<br><br> ‘Doesn't matter? What are you talking about? Of course, it<br> matters! Rhett, you do care, don't you? You must care. Melly<br> said you did.’<br><br> ‘Well, she was right, as far as she knew. But, Scarlett, did it<br> ever occur to you that even the most deathless love could wear<br> out?’<br><br> She looked at him speechless, her mouth a round O.<br><br> ‘Mine wore out,’ he went on, ‘against Ashley Wilkes and your insane<br> obstinacy that makes you hold on like a bulldog to anything you<br> think you want. . . . Mine wore out.’<br><br> ‘But love can't wear out!’<br><br> ‘Yours for Ashley did.’<br><br> ‘But I never really loved Ashley!’<br><br> ‘Then, you certainly gave a good imitation of it--up till tonight.<br> Scarlett, I'm not upbraiding you, accusing you, reproaching you.<br> That time has passed. So spare me your defenses and your<br> explanations. If you can manage to listen to me for a few minutes<br> without interrupting, I can explain what I mean. Though God knows,<br> I see no need for explanations. The truth's so plain.’<br><br> She sat down, the harsh gas light falling on her white bewildered<br> face. She looked into the eyes she knew so well--and knew so<br> little--listened to his quiet voice saying words which at first<br> meant nothing. This was the first time he had ever talked to her<br> in this manner, as one human being to another, talked as other<br> people talked, without flippancy, mockery or riddles.<br><br> ‘Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can<br> love a woman? Loved you for years before I finally got you?<br> During the war I'd go away and try to forget you, but I couldn't<br> and I always had to come back. After the war I risked arrest, just<br> to come back and find you. I cared so much I believe I would have<br> killed Frank Kennedy if he hadn't died when he did. I loved you<br> but I couldn't let you know it. You're so brutal to those who love<br> you, Scarlett. You take their love and hold it over their heads<br> like a whip.’<br><br> Out of it all only the fact that he loved her meant anything. At<br> the faint echo of passion in his voice, pleasure and excitement<br> crept back into her. She sat, hardly breathing, listening,<br> waiting.<br><br> ‘I knew you didn't love me when I married you. I knew about<br> Ashley, you see. But, fool that I was, I thought I could make you<br> care. Laugh, if you like, but I wanted to take care of you, to pet<br> you, to give you everything you wanted. I wanted to marry you and<br> protect you and give you a free rein in anything that would make<br> you happy--just as I did Bonnie. You'd had such a struggle,<br> Scarlett. No one knew better than I what you'd gone through and I<br> wanted you to stop fighting and let me fight for you. I wanted you<br> to play, like a child--for you were a child, a brave, frightened,<br> bullheaded child. I think you are still a child. No one but a<br> child could be so headstrong and so insensitive.’<br><br> His voice was calm and tired but there was something in the quality<br> of it that raised a ghost of memory in Scarlett. She had heard a<br> voice like this once before and at some other crisis of her life.<br> Where had it been? The voice of a man facing himself and his world<br> without feeling, without flinching, without hope.<br><br> Why--why--it had been Ashley in the wintry, windswept orchard at<br> Tara, talking of life and shadow shows with a tired calmness that<br> had more finality in its timbre than any desperate bitterness could<br> have revealed. Even as Ashley's voice then had turned her cold<br> with dread of things she could not understand, so now Rhett's voice<br> made her heart sink. His voice, his manner, more than the content<br> of his words, disturbed her, made her realize that her pleasurable<br> excitement of a few moments ago had been untimely. Something was<br> wrong, badly wrong. What it was she did not know but she listened<br> desperately, her eyes on his brown face, hoping to hear words that<br> would dissipate her fears.<br><br> ‘It was so obvious that we were meant for each other. So obvious<br> that I was the only man of your acquaintance who could love you<br> after knowing you as you really are--hard and greedy and<br> unscrupulous, like me. I loved you and I took the chance. I<br> thought Ashley would fade out of your mind. But,’ he shrugged, ‘I<br> tried everything I knew and nothing worked. And I loved you so,<br> Scarlett. If you had only let me, I could have loved you as gently<br> and as tenderly as ever a man loved a woman. But I couldn't let<br> you know, for I knew you'd think me weak and try to use my love<br> against me. And always--always there was Ashley. It drove me<br> crazy. I couldn't sit across the table from you every night,<br> knowing you wished Ashley was sitting there in my place. And I<br> couldn't hold you in my arms at night and know that--well, it<br> doesn't matter now. I wonder, now, why it hurt. That's what drove<br> me to Belle. There is a certain swinish comfort in being with a<br> woman who loves you utterly and respects you for being a fine<br> gentleman--even if she is an illiterate whore. It soothed my<br> vanity. You've never been very soothing, my dear.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Rhett . . .’ she began, miserable at the very mention of<br> Belle's name, but he waved her to silence and went on.<br><br> ‘And then, that night when I carried you upstairs--I thought--I<br> hoped--I hoped so much I was afraid to face you the next morning,<br> for fear I'd been mistaken and you didn't love me. I was so afraid<br> you'd laugh at me I went off and got drunk. And when I came back,<br> I was shaking in my boots and if you had come even halfway to meet<br> me, had given me some sign, I think I'd have kissed your feet. But<br> you didn't.’<br><br> ‘Oh, but Rhett, I did want you then but you were so nasty! I did<br> want you! I think--yes, that must have been when I first knew I<br> cared about you. Ashley--I never was happy about Ashley after<br> that, but you were so nasty that I--’<br><br> ‘Oh, well,’ he said. ‘It seems we've been at cross purposes,<br> doesn't it? But it doesn't matter now. I'm only telling you, so<br> you won't ever wonder about it all. When you were sick and it was<br> all my fault, I stood outside your door, hoping you'd call for me,<br> but you didn't, and then I knew what a fool I'd been and that it<br> was all over.’<br><br> He stopped and looked through her and beyond her, even as Ashley<br> had often done, seeing something she could not see. And she could<br> only stare speechless at his brooding face.<br><br> ‘But then, there was Bonnie and I saw that everything wasn't over,<br> after all. I liked to think that Bonnie was you, a little girl<br> again, before the war and poverty had done things to you. She was<br> so like you, so willful, so brave and gay and full of high spirits,<br> and I could pet her and spoil her--just as I wanted to pet you.<br> But she wasn't like you--she loved me. It was a blessing that I<br> could take the love you didn't want and give it to her. . . . When<br> she went, she took everything.’<br><br> Suddenly she was sorry for him, sorry with a completeness that<br> wiped out her own grief and her fear of what his words might mean.<br> It was the first time in her life she had been sorry for anyone<br> without feeling contemptuous as well, because it was the first time<br> she had ever approached understanding any other human being. And<br> she could understand his shrewd caginess, so like her own, his<br> obstinate pride that kept him from admitting his love for fear of a<br> rebuff.<br><br> ‘Ah, darling,’ she said coming forward, hoping he would put out his<br> arms and draw her to his knees. ‘Darling, I'm so sorry but I'll<br> make it all up to you! We can be so happy, now that we know the<br> truth and--Rhett--look at me, Rhett! There--there can be other<br> babies--not like Bonnie but--’<br><br> ‘Thank you, no,’ said Rhett, as if he were refusing a piece of<br> bread. ‘I'll not risk my heart a third time.’<br><br> ‘Rhett, don't say such things! Oh, what can I say to make you<br> understand? I've told you how sorry I am--’<br><br> ‘My darling, you're such a child. You think that by saying,<br> 'I'm sorry,' all the errors and hurts of years past can be<br> remedied, obliterated from the mind, all the poison drawn from<br> old wounds. . . . Take my handkerchief, Scarlett. Never, at any<br> crisis of your life, have I known you to have a handkerchief.’<br><br> She took the handkerchief, blew her nose and sat down. It was<br> obvious that he was not going to take her in his arms. It was<br> beginning to be obvious that all his talk about loving her meant<br> nothing. It was a tale of a time long past, and he was looking at<br> it as though it had never happened to him. And that was<br> frightening. He looked at her in an almost kindly way, speculation<br> in his eyes.<br><br> ‘How old are you, my dear? You never would tell me.’<br><br> ‘Twenty-eight,’ she answered dully, muffled in the handkerchief.<br><br> ‘That's not a vast age. It's a young age to have gained the whole<br> world and lost your own soul, isn't it? Don't look frightened.<br> I'm not referring to hell fire to come for your affair with Ashley.<br> I'm merely speaking metaphorically. Ever since I've known you,<br> you've wanted two things. Ashley and to be rich enough to tell the<br> world to go to hell. Well, you are rich enough and you've spoken<br> sharply to the world and you've got Ashley, if you want him. But<br> all that doesn't seem to be enough now.’<br><br> She was frightened but not at the thought of hell fire. She was<br> thinking: ‘But Rhett is my soul and I'm losing him. And if I lose<br> him, nothing else matters! No, not friends or money or--or<br> anything. If only I had him I wouldn't even mind being poor again.<br> No, I wouldn't mind being cold again or even hungry. But he can't<br> mean-- Oh, he can't!’<br><br> She wiped her eyes and said desperately:<br><br> ‘Rhett, if you once loved me so much, there must be something left<br> for me.’<br><br> ‘Out of it all I find only two things that remain and they are the<br> two things you hate the most--pity and an odd feeling of kindness.’<br><br> Pity! Kindness! ‘Oh, my God,’ she thought despairingly. Anything<br> but pity and kindness. Whenever she felt these two emotions for<br> anyone, they went hand in hand with contempt. Was he contemptuous<br> of her too? Anything would be preferable to that. Even the<br> cynical coolness of the war days, the drunken madness that drove<br> him the night he carried her up the stairs, his hard fingers<br> bruising her body, or the barbed drawling words that she now<br> realized had covered a bitter love. Anything except this<br> impersonal kindness that was written so plainly in his face.<br><br> ‘Then--then you mean I've ruined it all--that you don't love me any<br> more?’<br><br> ‘That's right.’<br><br> ‘But,’ she said stubbornly, like a child who still feels that to<br> state a desire is to gain that desire, ‘but I love you!’<br><br> ‘That's your misfortune.’<br><br> She looked up quickly to see if there was a jeer behind those words<br> but there was none. He was simply stating a fact. But it was a<br> fact she still would not believe--could not believe. She looked at<br> him with slanting eyes that burned with a desperate obstinacy and<br> the sudden hard line of jaw that sprang out through her soft cheek<br> was Gerald's jaw.<br><br> ‘Don't be a fool, Rhett! I can make--’<br><br> He flung up a hand in mock horror and his black brows went up in<br> the old sardonic crescents.<br><br> ‘Don't look so determined, Scarlett! You frighten me. I see you<br> are contemplating the transfer of your tempestuous affections from<br> Ashley to me and I fear for my liberty and my peace of mind. No,<br> Scarlett, I will not be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued.<br> Besides, I am going away.’<br><br> Her jaw trembled before she clenched her teeth to steady it. Go<br> away? No, anything but that! How could life go on without him?<br> Everyone had gone from her, everyone who mattered except Rhett. He<br> couldn't go. But how could she stop him? She was powerless<br> against his cool mind, his disinterested words.<br><br> ‘I am going away. I intended to tell you when you came home from<br> Marietta.’<br><br> ‘You are deserting me?’<br><br> ‘Don't be the neglected, dramatic wife, Scarlett. The role isn't<br> becoming. I take it, then, you do not want a divorce or even a<br> separation? Well, then, I'll come back often enough to keep gossip<br> down.’<br><br> ‘Damn gossip!’ she said fiercely. ‘It's you I want. Take me with<br> you!’<br><br> ‘No,’ he said, and there was finality in his voice. For a moment<br> she was on the verge of an outburst of childish wild tears. She<br> could have thrown herself on the floor, cursed and screamed and<br> drummed her heels. But some remnant of pride, of common sense<br> stiffened her. She thought, if I did, he'd only laugh, or just<br> look at me. I mustn't bawl; I mustn't beg. I mustn't do anything<br> to risk his contempt. He must respect me even--even if he doesn't<br> love me.<br><br> She lifted her chin and managed to ask quietly:<br><br> ‘Where will you go?’<br><br> There was a faint gleam of admiration in his eyes as he answered.<br><br> ‘Perhaps to England--or to Paris. Perhaps to Charleston to try to<br> make peace with my people.’<br><br> ‘But you hate them! I've heard you laugh at them so often and--’<br><br> He shrugged.<br><br> ‘I still laugh--but I've reached the end of roaming, Scarlett. I'm<br> forty-five--the age when a man begins to value some of the things<br> he's thrown away so lightly in youth, the clannishness of families,<br> honor and security, roots that go deep-- Oh, no! I'm not recanting,<br> I'm not regretting anything I've ever done. I've had a hell of a<br> good time--such a hell of a good time that it's begun to pall and<br> now I want something different. No, I never intend to change more<br> than my spots. But I want the outer semblance of the things I used<br> to know, the utter boredom of respectability--other people's<br> respectability, my pet, not my own--the calm dignity life can have<br> when it's lived by gentle folks, the genial grace of days that are<br> gone. When I lived those days I didn't realize the slow charm of<br> them--’<br><br> Again Scarlett was back in the windy orchard of Tara and there was<br> the same look in Rhett's eyes that had been in Ashley's eyes that<br> day. Ashley's words were as clear in her ears as though he and not<br> Rhett were speaking. Fragments of words came back to her and she<br> quoted parrot-like: ‘A glamor to it--a perfection, a symmetry like<br> Grecian art.’<br><br> Rhett said sharply: ‘Why did you say that? That's what I meant.’<br><br> ‘It was something that--that Ashley said once, about the old days.’<br><br> He shrugged and the light went out of his eyes.<br><br> ‘Always Ashley,’ he said and was silent for a moment.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, when you are forty-five, perhaps you will know what I'm<br> talking about and then perhaps you, too, will be tired of imitation<br> gentry and shoddy manners and cheap emotions. But I doubt it. I<br> think you'll always be more attracted by glister than by gold.<br> Anyway, I can't wait that long to see. And I have no desire to<br> wait. It just doesn't interest me. I'm going to hunt in old towns<br> and old countries where some of the old times must still linger.<br> I'm that sentimental. Atlanta's too raw for me, too new.’<br><br> ‘Stop,’ she said suddenly. She had hardly heard anything he had<br> said. Certainly her mind had not taken it in. But she knew she<br> could no longer endure with any fortitude the sound of his voice<br> when there was no love in it.<br><br> He paused and looked at her quizzically.<br><br> ‘Well, you get my meaning, don't you?’ he questioned, rising to his<br> feet.<br><br> She threw out her hands to him, palms up, in the age-old gesture of<br> appeal and her heart, again, was in her face.<br><br> ‘No,’ she cried. ‘All I know is that you do not love me and you<br> are going away! Oh, my darling, if you go, what shall I do?’<br><br> For a moment he hesitated as if debating whether a kind lie were<br> kinder in the long run than the truth. Then he shrugged.<br><br> ‘Scarlett, I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments<br> and glue them together and tell myself that the mended whole was as<br> good as new. What is broken is broken--and I'd rather remember it<br> as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as<br> long as I lived. Perhaps, if I were younger--’ he sighed. ‘But<br> I'm too old to believe in such sentimentalities as clean slates and<br> starting all over. I'm too old to shoulder the burden of constant<br> lies that go with living in polite disillusionment. I couldn't<br> live with you and lie to you and I certainly couldn't lie to<br> myself. I can't even lie to you now. I wish I could care what you<br> do or where you go, but I can't.’<br><br> He drew a short breath and said lightly but softly:<br><br> ‘My dear, I don't give a damn.’<br><br> <br> * * * * *<br><br> <br> She silently watched him go up the stairs, feeling that she would<br> strangle at the pain in her throat. With the sound of his feet<br> dying away in the upper hall was dying the last thing in the world<br> that mattered. She knew now that there was no appeal of emotion or<br> reason which would turn that cool brain from its verdict. She knew<br> now that he had meant every word he said, lightly though some of<br> them had been spoken. She knew because she sensed in him something<br> strong, unyielding, implacable--all the qualities she had looked<br> for in Ashley and never found.<br><br> She had never understood either of the men she had loved and so she<br> had lost them both. Now, she had a fumbling knowledge that, had<br> she ever understood Ashley, she would never have loved him; had she<br> ever understood Rhett, she would never have lost him. She wondered<br> forlornly if she had ever really understood anyone in the world.<br><br> There was a merciful dullness in her mind now, a dullness that she<br> knew from long experience would soon give way to sharp pain, even<br> as severed tissues, shocked by the surgeon's knife, have a brief<br> instant of insensibility before their agony begins.<br><br> ‘I won't think of it now,’ she thought grimly, summoning up her old<br> charm. ‘I'll go crazy if I think about losing him now. I'll think<br> of it tomorrow.’<br><br> ‘But,’ cried her heart, casting aside the charm and beginning to<br> ache, ‘I can't let him go! There must be some way!’<br><br> ‘I won't think of it now,’ she said again, aloud, trying to push<br> her misery to the back of her mind, trying to find some bulwark<br> against the rising tide of pain. ‘I'll--why, I'll go home to Tara<br> tomorrow,’ and her spirits lifted faintly.<br><br> She had gone back to Tara once in fear and defeat and she had<br> emerged from its sheltering walls strong and armed for victory.<br> What she had done once, somehow--please God, she could do again!<br> How, she did not know. She did not want to think of that now. All<br> she wanted was a breathing space in which to hurt, a quiet place to<br> lick her wounds, a haven in which to plan her campaign. She<br> thought of Tara and it was as if a gentle cool hand were stealing<br> over her heart. She could see the white house gleaming welcome to<br> her through the reddening autumn leaves, feel the quiet hush of the<br> country twilight coming down over her like a benediction, feel the<br> dews falling on the acres of green bushes starred with fleecy<br> white, see the raw color of the red earth and the dismal dark<br> beauty of the pines on the rolling hills.<br><br> She felt vaguely comforted, strengthened by the picture, and some<br> of her hurt and frantic regret was pushed from the top of her mind.<br> She stood for a moment remembering small things, the avenue of dark<br> cedars leading to Tara, the banks of cape jessamine bushes, vivid<br> green against the white walls, the fluttering white curtains. And<br> Mammy would be there. Suddenly she wanted Mammy desperately, as<br> she had wanted her when she was a little girl, wanted the broad<br> bosom on which to lay her head, the gnarled black hand on her hair.<br> Mammy, the last link with the old days.<br><br> With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat, even when<br> it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get<br> Rhett back. She knew she could. There had never been a man she<br> couldn't get, once she set her mind upon him.<br><br> ‘I'll think of it all tomorrow, at Tara. I can stand it then.<br> Tomorrow, I'll think of some way to get him back. After all,<br> tomorrow is another day.’<br><br> <br><br> THE END</p>"}
