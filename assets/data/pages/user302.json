We must not say so.<br>After all, the sky flashes, the great sea yearns,<br>we ourselves flash and yearn,<br>and moreover my mother told me as a boy<br>(repeatedly) 'Ever to confess you're bored<br>means you have no<br><br>Inner Resources.' I conclude now I have no<br>inner resources, because I am heavy bored.<br>Peoples bore me,<br>literature bores me, especially great literature,<br>Henry bores me, with his plights & gripes<br>as bad as achilles,<br><br>Who loves people and valiant art, which bores me.<br>And the tranquil hills, & gin, look like a drag<br>and somehow a dog<br>has taken itself & its tail considerably away<br>into mountains or sea or sky, leaving<br>behind: me, wag."
