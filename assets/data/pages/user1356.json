	"main_text":"“Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction It is already happening to some extent in our own society. Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.” Erich Fromm<br><br>Film Noir<br><br>Noir Stories and Poetry<br><br>Crime Novellas<br><br>Noir Short Stories and Poetry",
