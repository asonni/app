				"main_text": "I HEAR America singing, the varied carols I hear;<br>Those of mechanics-each one singing his, as it should be, blithe and strong;<br>The carpenter singing his, as he measures his plank or beam,<br>The mason singing his, as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work;<br>The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat-the deckhand singing on the steamboat<br>deck;<br>The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench-the hatter singing as he stands;<br>The wood-cutter's song-the ploughboy's, on his way in the morning, or at the noon<br>intermission, or at sundown;<br>The delicious singing of the mother-or of the young wife at work-or of the girl sewing or<br>washing-Each singing what belongs to her, and to none else;<br>The day what belongs to the day-At night, the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,<br>Singing, with open mouths, their strong melodious songs."
