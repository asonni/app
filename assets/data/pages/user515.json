				"main_text": "JOHN T. UNGER came from a family that had been well known in Hades--a small town on the Mississippi<br> River--for several generations.<br> John's father had held the amateur golf championship through many a heated contest; Mrs. Unger was known<br> 'from hot-box to hot-bed,' as the local phrase went, for her political addresses; and young John T. Unger, who<br> had just turned sixteen, had danced all the latest dances from New York before he put on long trousers. And now,<br> for a certain time, he was to be away from home. That respect for a New England education which is the bane of<br> all provincial places, which drains them yearly of their most promising young men, had seized upon his parents.<br> Nothing would suit them but that he should go to St. Midas' School near Boston-- Hades was too small to hold<br> their darling and gifted son.<br> Now in Hades--as you know if you ever have been there--the names of the more fashionable preparatory<br> schools and colleges mean very little. The inhabitants have been so long out of the world that, though they make a<br> show of keeping up to date in dress and manners and literature, they depend to a great extent on hearsay, and a<br> function that in Hades would be considered elaborate would doubtless be hailed by a Chicago beef-princess as<br> 'perhaps a little tacky.'<br> John T. Unger was on the eve of departure. Mrs. Unger, with maternal fatuity, packed his trunks full of linen suits<br> and electric fans, and Mr. Unger presented his son with an asbestos pocket-book stuffed with money.<br> 'Remember, you are always welcome here,' he said. 'You can be sure boy, that we'll keep the home fires<br> burning.'<br> 'I know,' answered John huskily.<br> 'Don't forget who you are and where you come from,' continued his father proudly, 'and you can do nothing to<br> harm you. You are an Unger--from Hades.'<br> So the old man and the young shook hands and John walked away with tears streaming from his eyes. Ten<br> minutes later he had passed outside the city limits, and he stopped to glance back for the last time. Over the gates<br> the old-fashioned Victorian motto seemed strangely attractive to him. His father had tried time and time again to<br> have it changed to something with a little more push and verve about it, such as 'Hades--Your Opportunity,' or<br> else a plain 'Welcome' sign set over a hearty handshake pricked out in electric lights. The old motto was a little<br> depressing, Mr. Unger had thought--but now....<br> So John took his look and then set his face resolutely toward his destination. And, as he turned away, the lights of<br> Hades against the sky seemed full of a warm and passionate beauty.<br> St. Midas' School is half an hour from Boston in a Rolls-Pierce motorcar. The actual distance will never be<br> known, for no one, except John T. Unger, had ever arrived there save in a Rolls-Pierce and probably no one ever<br> will again. St. Midas' is the most expensive and the most exclusive boys' preparatory school in the world.<br> John's first two years there passed pleasantly. The fathers of all the boys were money-kings and John spent his<br> summers visiting at fashionable resorts. While he was very fond of all the boys he visited, their fathers struck him<br> as being much of a piece, and in his boyish way he often wondered at their exceeding sameness. When he told<br> them where his home was they would ask jovially, 'Pretty hot down there?' and John would muster a faint smile<br> and answer, 'It certainly is.' His response would have been heartier had they not all made this joke--at best<br> varying it with, 'Is it hot enough for you down there?' which he hated just as much.<br> In the middle of his second year at school, a quiet, handsome boy named Percy Washington had been put in John's<br> form. The newcomer was pleasant in his manner and exceedingly well dressed even for St. Midas', but for some<br> reason he kept aloof from the other boys. The only person with whom he was intimate was John T. Unger, but<br> even to John he was entirely uncommunicative concerning his home or his family. That he was wealthy went<br> without saying, but beyond a few such deductions John knew little of his friend, so it promised rich confectionery<br> for his curiosity when Percy invited him to spend the summer at his home 'in the West.' He accepted, without<br> hesitation.<br> It was only when they were in the train that Percy became, for the first time, rather communicative. One day while<br> they were eating lunch in the dining-car and discussing the imperfect characters of several of the boys at school,<br> Percy suddenly changed his tone and made an abrupt remark.<br> 'My father,' he said, 'is by far the richest man in the world.'<br> 'Oh,' said John, politely. He could think of no answer to make to this confidence. He considered 'That's very<br> nice,' but it sounded hollow and was on the point of saying, 'Really?' but refrained since it would seem to<br> question Percy's statement. And such an astounding statement could scarcely be questioned.<br> 'By far the richest,' repeated Percy.<br> 'I was reading in the World Almanac,' began John, 'that there was one man in America with an income of over<br> five million a year and four men with incomes of over three million a year, and--'<br> 'Oh, they're nothing.' Percy's mouth was a half-moon of scorn. 'Catchpenny capitalists, financial small-fry,<br> petty merchants and money-lenders. My father could buy them out and not know he'd done it.'<br> 'But how does he--'<br> 'Why haven't they put down his income tax? Because he doesn't pay any. At least he pays a little one--but he<br> doesn't pay any on his real income.'<br> 'He must be very rich,' said John simply. 'I'm glad. I like very rich people.<br> 'The richer a fella is, the better I like him.' There was a look of passionate frankness upon his dark face. 'I visited<br> the Schnlitzer-Murphys last Easter. Vivian Schnlitzer-Murphy had rubies as big as hen's eggs, and sapphires that<br> were like globes with lights inside them--'<br> 'I love jewels,' agreed Percy enthusiastically. 'Of course I wouldn't want any one at school to know about it, but<br> I've got quite a collection myself I used to collect them instead of stamps.'<br> 'And diamonds,' continued John eagerly. 'The Schnlitzer-Murphys had diamonds as big as walnuts--'<br> 'That's nothing.' Percy had leaned forward and dropped his voice to a low whisper. 'That's nothing at all. My<br> father has a diamond bigger than the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.'<br><br>II<br> THE MONTANA sunset lay between two mountains like a gigantic bruise from which dark arteries spread<br> themselves over a poisoned sky. An immense distance under the sky crouched the village of Fish, minute, dismal,<br> and forgotten. There were twelve men, so it was said, in the village of Fish, twelve somber and inexplicable souls<br> who sucked a lean milk from the almost literally bare rock upon which a mysterious populatory force had<br> begotten them. They had become a race apart, these twelve men of Fish, like some species developed by an early<br> whim of nature, which on second thought had abandoned them to struggle and extermination.<br> Out of the blue-black bruise in the distance crept a long line of moving lights upon the desolation of the land, and<br> the twelve men of Fish gathered like ghosts at the shanty depot to watch the passing of the seven o'clock train, the<br> Transcontinental Express from Chicago. Six times or so a year the Transcontinental Express, through some<br> inconceivable jurisdiction, stopped at the village of Fish, and when this occurred a figure or so would disembark,<br> mount into a buggy that always appeared from out of the dusk, and drive off toward the bruised sunset. The<br> observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon had become a sort of cult among the men of Fish. To<br> observe, that was all; there remained in them none of the vital quality of illusion which would make them wonder<br> or speculate, else a religion might have grown up around these mysterious visitations. But the men of Fish were<br> beyond all religion--the barest and most savage tenets of even Christianity could gain no foothold on that barren<br> rock--so there was no altar, no priest, no sacrifice; only each night at seven the silent concourse by the shanty<br> depot, a congregation who lifted up a prayer of dim, anaemic wonder.<br> On this June night, the Great Brakeman, whom, had they deified any one, they might well have chosen as their<br> celestial protagonist, had ordained that the seven o'clock train should leave its human (or inhuman) deposit at<br> Fish. At two minutes after seven Percy Washington and John T. Unger disembarked, hurried past the spellbound,<br> the agape, the fearsome eyes of the twelve men of Fish, mounted into a buggy which had obviously appeared<br> from nowhere, and drove away.<br> After half an hour, when the twilight had coagulated into dark, the silent negro who was driving the buggy hailed<br> an opaque body somewhere ahead of them in the gloom. In response to his cry, it turned upon them a luminous<br> disk which regarded them like a malignant eye out of the unfathomable night. As they came closer, John saw that<br> it was the tail-light of an immense automobile, larger and more magnificent than any he had ever seen. Its body<br> was of gleaming metal richer than nickel and lighter than silver, and the hubs of the wheels were studded with<br> iridescent geometric figures of green and yellow--John did not dare to guess whether they were glass or jewel.<br> Two negroes, dressed in glittering livery such as one sees in pictures of royal processions in London, were<br> standing at attention beside the car and as the two young men dismounted from the buggy they were greeted in<br> some language which the guest could not understand, but which seemed to be an extreme form of the Southern<br> negro's dialect.<br> 'Get in,' said Percy to his friend, as their trunks were tossed to the ebony roof of the limousine. 'Sorry we had to<br> bring you this far in that buggy, but of course it wouldn't do for the people on the train or those Godforsaken fellas<br> in Fish to see this automobile.'<br> 'Gosh! What a car!' This ejaculation was provoked by its interior. John saw that the upholstery consisted of a<br> thousand minute and exquisite tapestries of silk, woven with jewels and embroideries, and set upon a background<br> of cloth of gold. The two armchair seats in which the boys luxuriated were covered with stuff that resembled<br> duvetyn, but seemed woven in numberless colors of the ends of ostrich feathers.<br> 'What a car!' cried John again, in amazement.<br> 'This thing?' Percy laughed. 'Why, it's just an old junk we use for a station wagon.'<br> By this time they were gliding along through the darkness toward the break between the two mountains.<br> 'We'll be there in an hour and a half,' said Percy, looking at the clock. 'I may as well tell you it's not going to be<br> like anything you ever saw before.'<br> If the car was any indication of what John would see, he was prepared to be astonished indeed. The simple piety<br> prevalent in Hades has the earnest worship of and respect for riches as the first article of its creed--had John felt<br> otherwise than radiantly humble before them, his parents would have turned away in horror at the blasphemy.<br> They had now reached and were entering the break between the two mountains and almost immediately the way<br> became much rougher.<br> 'If the moon shone down here, you'd see that we're in a big gulch,' said Percy, trying to peer out of the window.<br> He spoke a few words into the mouthpiece and immediately the footman turned on a search-light and swept the<br> hillsides with an immense beam.<br> 'Rocky, you see. An ordinary car would be knocked to pieces in half an hour. In fact, it'd take a tank to navigate it<br> unless you knew the way. You notice we're going uphill now.'<br> They were obviously ascending, and within a few minutes the car was crossing a high rise, where they caught a<br> glimpse of a pale moon newly risen in the distance. The car stopped suddenly and several figures took shape out<br> of the dark beside it--these were negroes also. Again the two young men were saluted in the same dimly<br> recognizable dialect; then the negroes set to work and four immense cables dangling from overhead were attached<br> with hooks to the hubs of the great jeweled wheels. At a resounding 'Hey-yah!' John felt the car being lifted<br> slowly from the ground-- up and up--clear of the tallest rocks on both sides--then higher, until he could see a<br> wavy, moonlit valley stretched out before him in sharp contrast to the quagmire of rocks that they had just left.<br> Only on one side was there still rock--and then suddenly there was no rock beside them or anywhere around.<br> It was apparent that they had surmounted some immense knife-blade of stone, projecting perpendicularly into the<br> air. In a moment they were going down again, and finally with a soft bump they were landed upon the smooth<br> earth.<br> 'The worst is over,' said Percy, squinting out the window. 'It's only five miles from here, and our own<br> road--tapestry brick--all the way. This belongs to us. This is where the United States ends, father says.'<br> 'Are we in Canada?'<br> 'We are not. We're in the middle of the Montana Rockies. But you are now on the only five square miles of land<br> in the country that's never been surveyed.'<br> 'Why hasn't it? Did they forget it?'<br> 'No,' said Percy, grinning, 'they tried to do it three times. The first time my grandfather corrupted a whole<br> department of the State survey; the second time he had the official maps of the United States tinkered with--that<br> held them for fifteen years. The last time was harder. My father fixed it so that their compasses were in the<br> strongest magnetic field ever artificially set up. He had a whole set of surveying instruments made with a slight<br> defection that would allow for this territory not to appear, and he substituted them for the ones that were to be<br> used. Then he had a river deflected and he had what looked like a village built up on its banks--so that they'd see<br> it, and think it was a town ten miles farther up the valley. There's only one thing my father's afraid of,' he<br> concluded, 'only one thing in the world that could be used to find us out.'<br> 'What's that?'<br> Percy sank his voice to a whisper.<br> 'Aeroplanes,' he breathed. 'We've got half a dozen anti-aircraft guns and we've arranged it so far--but there've<br> been a few deaths and a great many prisoners. Not that we mind that, you know, father and I, but it upsets mother<br> and the girls, and there's always the chance that some time we won't be able to arrange it.'<br> Shreds and tatters of chinchilla, courtesy clouds in the green moon's heaven, were passing the green moon like<br> precious Eastern stuffs paraded for the inspection of some Tartar Khan. It seemed to John that it was day, and that<br> he was looking at some lads sailing above him in the air, showering down tracts and patent medicine circulars,<br> with their messages of hope for despairing, rockbound hamlets. It seemed to him that he could see them look<br> down out of the clouds and stare--and stare at whatever there was to stare at in this place whither he was<br> bound--What then? Were they induced to land by some insidious device there to be immured far from patent<br> medicines and from tracts until the judgment day--or, should they fail to fall into the trap, did a quick puff of<br> smoke and the sharp round of a splitting shell bring them drooping to earth--and 'upset' Percy's mother and<br> sisters. John shook his head and the wraith of a hollow laugh issued silently from his parted lips. What desperate<br> transaction lay hidden here? What a moral expedient of a bizarre Croesus? What terrible and golden mystery? . . .<br> The chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and outside the Montana night was bright as day. The tapestry brick of<br> the road was smooth to the tread of the great tires as they rounded a still, moonlit lake; they passed into darkness<br> for a moment, a pine grove, pungent and cool, then they came out into a broad avenue of lawn and John's<br> exclamation of pleasure was simultaneous with Percy's taciturn 'We're home.'<br> Full in the light of the stars, an exquisite ch_teau rose from the borders of the lake, climbed in marble radiance<br> half the height of an adjoining mountain, then melted in grace, in perfect symmetry, in translucent feminine<br> languor, into the massed darkness of a forest of pine. The many towers, the slender tracery of the sloping parapets,<br> the chiselled wonder of a thousand yellow windows with their oblongs and hectagons and triangles of golden<br> light, the shattered softness of the intersecting planes of star-shine and blue shade, all trembled on John's spirit<br> like a chord of music. On one of the towers, the tallest, the blackest at its base, an arrangement of exterior lights at<br> the top made a sort of floating fairyland--and as John gazed up in warm enchantment the faint acciaccare sound<br> of violins drifted down in a rococo harmony that was like nothing he had ever heard before. Then in a moment the<br> car stopped before wide, high marble steps around which the night air was fragrant with a host of flowers. At the<br> top of the steps two great doors swung silently open and amber light flooded out upon the darkness, silhouetting<br> the figure of an exquisite lady with black, high-piled hair, who held out her arms toward them.<br> 'Mother,' Percy was saying, 'this is my friend, John Unger, from Hades.'<br> Afterward John remembered that first night as a daze of many colors, of quick sensory impressions, of music soft<br> as a voice in love, and of the beauty of things, lights and shadows, and motions and faces. There was a<br> whitehaired man who stood drinking a many-hued cordial from a crystal thimble set on a golden stem. There was<br> a girl with a flowery face, dressed like Titania with braided sapphires in her hair. There was a room where the<br> solid, soft gold of the walls yielded to the pressure of his hand, and a room that was like a platonic conception of<br> the ultimate prism--ceiling, floor, and all, it was lined with an unbroken mass of diamonds, diamonds of every<br> size and shape, until, lit with tall violet lamps in the corners, it dazzled the eyes with a whiteness that could be<br> compared only with itself, beyond human wish or dream.<br> Through a maze of these rooms the two boys wandered. Sometimes the floor under their feet would flame in<br> brilliant patterns from lighting below, patterns of barbaric clashing colors, of pastel delicacy, of sheer whiteness,<br> or of subtle and intricate mosaic, surely from some mosque on the Adriatic Sea. Sometimes beneath layers of<br> thick crystal he would see blue or green water swirling, inhabited by vivid fish and growths of rainbow foliage.<br> Then they would be treading on furs of every texture and color or along corridors of palest ivory, unbroken as<br> though carved complete from the gigantic tusks of dinosaurs extinct before the age of man. . . .<br> Then a hazily remembered transition, and they were at dinner--where each plate was of two almost imperceptible<br> layers of solid diamond between which was curiously worked a filigree of emerald design, a shaving sliced from<br> green air. Music, plangent and unobtrusive, drifted down through far corridors--his chair, feathered and curved<br> insidiously to his back, seemed to engulf and overpower him as he drank his first glass of port. He tried drowsily<br> to answer a question that had been asked him, but the honeyed luxury that clasped his body added to the illusion<br> of sleep--jewels, fabrics, wines, and metals blurred before his eyes into a sweet mist. . . .<br> 'Yes,' he replied with a polite effort, 'it certainly is hot enough for me down there.'<br> He managed to add a ghostly laugh; then, without movement, without resistance, he seemed to float off and away,<br> leaving an iced dessert that was pink as a dream. . . . He fell asleep.<br> When he awoke he knew that several hours had passed. He was in a great quiet room with ebony walls and a dull<br> illumination that was too faint, too subtle, to be called a light. His young host was standing over him.<br> 'You fell asleep at dinner,' Percy was saying. 'I nearly did, too--it was such a treat to be comfortable again after<br> this year of school. Servants undressed and bathed you while you were sleeping.'<br> 'Is this a bed or a cloud?' sighed John. 'Percy, Percy--before you go, I want to apologize.'<br> 'For what?'<br> 'For doubting you when you said you had a diamond as big as the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.'<br> Percy smiled.<br> 'I thought you didn't believe me. It's that mountain, you know.'<br> 'What mountain?'<br> 'The mountain the ch_teau rests on. It's not very big, for a mountain. But except about fifty feet of sod and gravel<br> on top it's solid diamond.One diamond, one cubic mile without a flaw. Aren't you listening? Say----'<br> But John T. Unger had again fallen asleep.<br> III<br> MORNING. As he awoke he perceived drowsily that the room had at the same moment become dense with<br> sunlight. The ebony panels of one wall had slid aside on a sort of track, leaving his chamber half open to the day.<br> A large negro in a white uniform stood beside his bed.<br> 'Good-evening,' muttered John, summoning his brains from the wild places.<br> 'Good-morning, sir. Are you ready for your bath, sir? Oh, don't get up--I'll put you in, if you'll just unbutton<br> your pajamas--there. Thank you, sir.'<br> John lay quietly as his pajamas were removed--he was amused and delighted; he expected to be lifted like a child<br> by this black Gargantua who was tending him, but nothing of the sort happened; instead he felt the bed tilt up<br> slowly on its side--he began to roll, startled at first, in the direction of the wall, but when he reached the wall its<br> drapery gave way, and sliding two yards farther down a fleecy incline he plumped gently into water the same<br> temperature as his body.<br> He looked about him. The runway or rollway on which he had arrived had folded gently back into place. He had<br> been projected into another chamber and was sitting in a sunken bath with his head just above the level of the<br> floor. All about him, lining the walls of the room and the sides and bottom of the bath itself, was a blue aquarium,<br> and gazing through the crystal surface on which he sat, he could see fish swimming among amber lights and even<br> gliding without curiosity past his outstretched toes, which were separated from them only by the thickness of the<br> crystal. From overhead, sunlight came down through sea-green glass.<br> I suppose, sir, that you'd like hot rosewater and soapsuds this morning sir--and perhaps cold salt water to finish.'<br> The negro was standing beside him.<br> 'Yes,' agreed John, smiling inanely, 'as you please.' Any idea of ordering this bath according to his own meager<br> standards of living would have been priggish and not a little wicked.<br> The negro pressed a button and a warm rain began to fall, apparently from overhead, but really, so John<br> discovered after a moment, from a fountain arrangement near by. The water turned to a pale rose color and jets of<br> liquid soap spurted into it from four miniature walrus heads at the corners of the bath. In a moment a dozen little<br> paddle-wheels, fixed to the sides, had churned the mixture into a radiant rainbow of pink foam which enveloped<br> him softly with its delicious lightness, and burst in shining, rosy bubbles here and there about him.<br> 'Shall I turn on the moving-picture machine, sir?' suggested the negro deferentially. 'There's a good one-reel<br> comedy in this machine to-day, or can put in a serious piece in a moment, if you prefer it.'<br> 'No, thanks,' answered John, politely but firmly. He was enjoying his at too much to desire any distraction. But<br> distraction came. In a moment he was listening intently to the sound of flutes from just outside, flutes ripping a<br> melody that was like a waterfall, cool and green as the room itself, accompanying a frothy piccolo, in play more<br> fragile than the lace of u s that covered and charmed him.<br> After a cold salt-water bracer and a cold fresh finish, he stepped out and into a fleecy robe, and upon a couch<br> covered with the same material he was rubbed with oil, alcohol, and spice. Later he sat in a voluptuous chair<br> while he was shaved and his hair was trimmed.<br> 'Mr. Percy is waiting in your sitting-room,' said the negro, when these operations were finished. 'My name is<br> Gygsum, Mr. Unger, sir. I am to see to Mr. Unger every morning.'<br> John walked out into the brisk sunshine of his living-room, where he found breakfast waiting for him and Percy,<br> gorgeous in white kid knickerbockers, smoking in an easy chair.<br> IV<br> THIS IS A STORY of the Washington family as Percy sketched it for John during breakfast.<br> The father of the present Mr. Washington had been a Virginian, a direct descendant of George Washington, and<br> Lord Baltimore. At the close of the Civil War he was a twenty-five-year-old Colonel with a played-out<br> plantation and about a thousand dollars in gold.<br> Fitz-Norman Culpepper Washington, for that was the young Colonel's name, decided to present the Virginia<br> estate to his younger brother and go West. He selected two dozen of the most faithful blacks, who, of course,<br> worshipped him, and bought twenty-five tickets to the West, where he intended to take out land in their names<br> and start a sheep and cattle ranch.<br> When he had been in Montana for less than a month and things were going very poorly indeed, he stumbled on<br> his great discovery. He had lost his way when riding in the hills, and after a day without food he began to grow<br> hungry. As he was without his rifle, he was forced to pursue a squirrel, and in the course of the pursuit he noticed<br> that it was carrying something shiny in its mouth. Just before it vanished into its hole--for Providence did not<br> intend that this squirrel should alleviate his hunger--it dropped its burden. Sitting down to consider the situation<br> Fitz-Norman's eye was caught by a gleam in the grass beside him. In ten seconds he had completely lost his<br> appetite and gained one hundred thousand dollars. The squirrel, which had refused with annoying persistence to<br> become food, had made him a present of a large and perfect diamond.<br> Late that night he found his way to camp and twelve hours later all the males among his darkies were back by the<br> squirrel hole digging furiously at the side of the mountain. He told them he had discovered a rhinestone mine,<br> and, as only one or two of them had ever seen even a small diamond before, they believed him, without question.<br> When the magnitude of his discovery became apparent to him, he found himself in a quandary. The mountain was<br> a diamond--it was literally nothing else but solid diamond. He filled four saddle bags full of glittering samples<br> and started on horseback for St. Paul. There he managed to dispose of half a dozen small stones--when he tried a<br> larger one a storekeeper fainted and Fitz-Norman was arrested as a public disturber. He escaped from jail and<br> caught the train for New York, where he sold a few medium-sized diamonds and received in exchange about two<br> hundred thousand dollars in gold. But he did not dare to produce any exceptional gems--in fact, he left New<br> York just in time. Tremendous excitement had been created in jewelry circles, not so much by the size of his<br> diamonds as by their appearance in the city from mysterious sources. Wild rumors became current that a diamond<br> mine had been discovered in the Catskills, on the Jersey coast, on Long Island, beneath Washington Square.<br> Excursion trains, packed with men carrying picks and shovels, began to leave New York hourly, bound for<br> various neighboring El Dorados. But by that time young Fitz-Norman was on his way back to Montana.<br> By the end of a fortnight he had estimated that the diamond in the mountain was approximately equal in quantity<br> to all the rest of the diamonds known to exist in the world. There was no valuing it by any regular computation,<br> however, for it was one solid diamond--and if it were offered for sale not only would the bottom fall out of the<br> market, but also, if the value should vary with its size in the usual arithmetical progression, there would not be<br> enough gold in the world to buy a tenth part of it. And what could any one do with a diamond that size?<br> It was an amazing predicament. He was, in one sense, the richest man that ever lived--and yet was he worth<br> anything at all? If his secret should transpire there was no telling to what measures the Government might resort<br> in order to prevent a panic, in gold as well as in jewels. They might take over the claim immediately and institute<br> a monopoly.<br> There was no alternative--he must market his mountain in secret. He sent South for his younger brother and put<br> him in charge of his colored following--darkies who had never realized that slavery was abolished. To make sure<br> of this, he read them a proclamation that he had composed, which announced that General Forrest had reorganized<br> the shattered Southern armies and defeated the North in one pitched battle. The negroes believed him implicitly.<br> They passed a vote declaring it a good thing and held revival services immediately.<br> Fitz-Norman himself set out for foreign parts with one hundred thousand dollars and two trunks filled with rough<br> diamonds of all sizes. He sailed for Russia in a Chinese junk and six months after his departure from Montana he<br> was in St. Petersburg. He took obscure lodgings and called immediately upon the court jeweller, announcing that<br> he had a diamond for the Czar. He remained in St. Petersburg for two weeks, in constant danger of being<br> murdered, living from lodging to lodging, and afraid to visit his trunks more than three or four times during the<br> whole fortnight.<br> On his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he was allowed to leave for India. Before he left,<br> however, the Court Treasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of fifteen million<br> dollars--under four different aliases.<br> He returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two years. He had visited the capitals of<br> twenty-two countries and talked with five emperors, eleven kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a sultan. At<br> that time Fitz-Norman estimated his own wealth at one billion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the<br> disclosure of his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public eye for a week before being<br> invested with a history of enough fatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the days of the<br> first Babylonian Empire.<br> From 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of Fitz-Norman Washington was a long epic in gold. There were<br> side issues, of course--he evaded the surveys, he married a Virginia lady, by whom he had a single son, and he<br> was compelled, due to a series of unfortunate complications, to murder his brother, whose unfortunate habit of<br> drinking himself into an indiscreet stupor had several times endangered their safety. But very few other murders<br> stained these happy years of progress and expansion.<br> Just before he died he changed his policy, and with all but a few million dollars of his outside wealth bought up<br> rare minerals in bulk, which he deposited in the safety vaults of banks all over the world, marked as bric-_-brac.<br> His son, Braddock Tarleton Washington, followed this policy on an even more tensive scale. The minerals were<br> converted into the rarest of all elements--radium--so that the equivalent of a billion dollars in gold could be<br> placed in a receptacle no bigger than a cigar box.<br> When Fitz-Norman had been dead three years his son, Braddock, decided that the business had gone far enough.<br> The amount of wealth that he and his father had taken out of the mountain was beyond all exact computation. He<br> kept a note-book in cipher in which he set down the approximate quantity of radium in each of the thousand<br> banks he patronized, and recorded the alias under which it was held. Then he did a very simple thing--he sealed<br> up the mine.<br> He sealed up the mine. What had been taken out of it would support all the Washingtons yet to be born in<br> unparalleled luxury for generations. His one care must be the protection of his secret, lest in the possible panic<br> attendant on its discovery he should be reduced with all the property-holders in the world to utter poverty.<br> This was the family among whom John T. Unger was staying. This was the story he heard in his silver-walled<br> living-room the morning after his arrival.<br> IV<br> AFTER BREAKFAST, John found his way out the great marble entrance and looked curiously at the scene<br> before him. The whole valley, from the diamond mountain to the steep granite cliff five miles away, still gave off<br> a breath of golden haze which hovered idly above the fine sweep of lawns and lakes and gardens. Here and there<br> clusters of elms made delicate groves of shade, contrasting strangely with the tough masses of pine forest that<br> held the hills in a grip of dark-blue green. Even as John looked he saw three fawns in single file patter out from<br> one clump about a half mile away and disappear with awkward gayety into the black-ribbed half-light of another.<br> John would not have been surprised to see a goat-foot piping his way among the trees or to catch a glimpse of<br> pink nymph-skin and flying yellow hair between the greenest of the green leaves.<br> In some such cool hope he descended the marble steps, disturbing faintly the sleep of two silky Russian<br> wolfhounds at the bottom, and set off along a walk of white and blue brick that seemed to lead in no particular<br> direction.<br> He was enjoying himself as much as he was able. It is youth's felicity as well as its insufficiency that it can never<br> live in the present, but must always be measuring up the day against its own radiantly imagined future--flowers<br> and gold, girls and stars, they are only prefigurations and prophecies of that incomparable, unattainable young<br> dream.<br> John rounded a soft corner where the massed rose-bushes filled the air with heavy scent, and struck off across a<br> park toward a patch of moss under some trees. He had never lain upon moss, and he wanted to see whether it was<br> really soft enough to justify the use of its name as an adjective. Then he saw a girl coming toward him over the<br> grass. She was the most beautiful person he had ever seen<br> She was dressed in a white little gown that came just below her knees, and a wreath of mignonettes clasped with<br> blue slices of sapphire bound up her hair. Her pink bare feet scattered the dew before them as she came. She was<br> younger than John--not more than sixteen.<br> 'Hello,' she cried softly, 'I'm Kismine.'<br> She was much more than that to John already. He advanced toward her, scarcely moving as he drew near lest he<br> should tread on her bare toes.<br> 'You haven't met me,' said her soft voice. Her blue eyes added, 'Oh, but you've missed a great deal!' . . . 'You<br> met my sister, Jasmine, last night. I was sick with lettuce poisoning,' went on her soft voice, and her eyes<br> continued, 'and when I'm sick I'm sweet--and when I'm well.'<br> 'You have made an enormous impression on me,' said John's eyes, 'and I'm not so slow myself'--'How do you<br> do?' said his voice. 'I hope you're better this morning.'--'You darling,' added his eyes tremulously.<br> John observed that they had been walking along the path. On her suggestion they sat down together upon the<br> moss, the softness of which he failed to determine.<br> He was critical about women. A single defect--a thick ankle, a hoarse voice, a glass eye--was enough to make<br> him utterly indifferent. And here for the first time in his life he was beside a girl who seemed to him the<br> incarnation of physical perfection.<br> 'Are you from the East?' asked Kismine with charming interest.<br> 'No,' answered John simply. 'I'm from Hades.'<br> Either she had never heard of Hades, or she could think of no pleasant comment to make upon it, for she did not<br> discuss it further.<br> 'I'm going East to school this fall,' she said. 'D'you think I'll like it? I'm going to New York to Miss Bulge's. It's<br> very strict, but you see over the weekends I'm going to live at home with the family in our New York house,<br> because father heard that the girls had to go walking two by two.'<br> 'Your father wants you to be proud,' observed John.<br> 'We are,' she answered, her eyes shining with dignity.'None of us has ever been punished. Father said we never<br> should be. Once when my sister Jasmine was a little girl she pushed him down-stairs and he just got up and<br> limped away.<br> 'Mother was--well, a little startled,' continued Kismine, 'when she heard that you were from--from where you<br> are from, you know. She said that when she was a young girl--but then, you see, she's a Spaniard and<br> old-fashioned.'<br> 'Do you spend much time out here?' asked John, to conceal the fact that he was somewhat hurt by this remark. It<br> seemed an unkind allusion to his provincialism.<br> 'Percy and Jasmine and I are here every summer, but next summer Jasmine is going to Newport. She's coming out<br> in London a year from this fall. She'll be presented at court.'<br> 'Do you know, ' began John hesitantly, 'you're much more sophisticated than I thought you were when I first saw<br> you?'<br> 'Oh, no, I'm not,' she exclaimed hurriedly. 'Oh, I wouldn't think of being. I think that sophisticated young people<br> are terriblycommon, don't you? I'm not at all, really. If you say I am, I'm going to cry.'<br> She was so distressed that her lip was trembling. John was impelled to protest:<br> I didn't mean that; I only said it to tease you.'<br> 'Because I wouldn't mind if I were,' she persisted. 'but I'm not. I'm very innocent and girlish. I never smoke, or<br> drink, or read anything except poetry. I know scarcely any mathematics or chemistry. I dress very simply--in<br> fact, I scarcely dress at all. I think sophisticated is the last thing you can say about me. I believe that girls ought to<br> enjoy their youths in a wholesome way.'<br> 'I do, too,' said John heartily.<br> Kismine was cheerful again. She smiled at him, and a still-born tear dripped from the corner of one blue eye.<br> 'I like you,' she whispered, intimately. 'Are you going to spend all your time with Percy while you're here, or<br> will you be nice to me. Just think--I'm absolutely fresh ground. I've never had a boy in love with me in all my<br> life. I've never been allowed even to see boys alone--except Percy. I came all the way out here into this grove<br> hoping to run into you, where the family wouldn't be around.<br> Deeply flattered, John bowed from the hips as he had been taught at dancing school in Hades.<br> 'We'd better go now,' said Kismine sweetly. 'I have to be with mother at eleven. You haven't asked me to kiss<br> you once. I thought boys always did that nowadays.'<br> John drew himself up proudly.<br> 'Some of them do,' he answered, 'but not me. Girls don't do that sort of thing--in Hades.'<br> Side by side they walked back toward the house.<br> VI<br> JOHN STOOD facing Mr. Braddock Washington in the full sunlight. The elder man was about forty with a proud,<br> vacuous face, intelligent eyes, and a robust figure. In the mornings he smelt of horses--the best horses. He<br> carried a plain walking-stick of gray birch with a single large opal for a grip. He and Percy were showing John<br> around.<br> 'The slaves' quarters are there.' His walking-stick indicated a cloister of marble on their left that ran in graceful<br> Gothic along the side of the mountain. 'In my youth I was distracted for a while from the business of life by a<br> period of absurd idealism. During that time they lived in luxury. For instance, I equipped every one of their rooms<br> with a tile bath.'<br> 'I suppose,' ventured John, with an ingratiating laugh, 'that they used the bathtubs to keep coal in. Mr.<br> Schnlitzer-Murphy told me that once he----'<br> 'The opinions of Mr. Schnlitzer-Murphy are of little importance, I should imagine,' interrupted Braddock<br> Washington, coldly. 'My slaves did not keep coal in their bathtubs. They had orders to bathe every day, and they<br> did. If they hadn't I might have ordered a sulphuric acid shampoo. I discontinued the baths for quite another<br> reason. Several of them caught cold and died. Water is not good for certain races--except as a beverage.'<br> John laughed, and then decided to nod his head in sober agreement. Braddock Washington made him<br> uncomfortable.<br> 'All these negroes are descendants of the ones my father brought North with him. There are about two hundred<br> and fifty now. You notice that they've lived so long apart from the world that their original dialect has become an<br> almost indistinguishable patois. We bring a few of them up to speak English--my secretary and two or three of<br> the house servants.<br> 'This is the golf course,' he continued, as they strolled along the velvet winter grass. 'It's all a green, you see--no<br> fairway, no rough, no hazards.'<br> He smiled pleasantly at John.<br> 'Many men in the cage, father?' asked Percy suddenly.<br> Braddock Washington stumbled, and let forth an involuntary curse.<br> 'One less than there should be,' he ejaculated darkly--and then added after a moment, 'We've had difficulties.'<br> 'Mother was telling me,' exclaimed Percy, 'that Italian teacher----'<br> 'A ghastly error,' said Braddock Washington angrily. 'But of course there's a good chance that we may have got<br> him. Perhaps he fell somewhere in the woods or stumbled over a cliff. And then there's always the probability that<br> if he did get away his story wouldn't be believed. Nevertheless, I've had two dozen men looking for him in<br> different towns around here.'<br> 'And no luck?'<br> 'Some. Fourteen of them reported to my agent that they'd each killed a man answering to that description, but of<br> course it was probably only the reward they were after----'<br> He broke off. They had come to a large cavity in the earth about the circumference of a merry-go-round and<br> covered by a strong iron grating. Braddock Washington beckoned to John, and pointed his cane down through the<br> grating. John stepped to the edge and gazed. Immediately his ears were assailed by a wild clamor from below.<br> 'Come on down to Hell!'<br> 'Hello, kiddo, how's the air up there?'<br> 'Hey! Throw us a rope!'<br> 'Got an old doughnut, Buddy, or a couple of second-hand sandwiches?'<br> 'Say, fella, if you'll push down that guy you're with, we'll show you a quick disappearance scene.'<br> 'Paste him one for me, will you?'<br> It was too dark to see clearly into the pit below, but John could tell from the coarse optimism and rugged vitality<br> of the remarks and voices that they proceeded from middle-class Americans of the more spirited type. Then Mr.<br> Washington put out his cane and touched a button in the grass, and the scene below sprang into light.<br> 'These are some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune to discover El Dorado,' he remarked.<br> Below them there had appeared a large hollow in the earth shaped like the interior of a bowl. The sides were steep<br> and apparently of polished glass, and on its slightly concave surface stood about two dozen men clad in the half<br> costume, half uniform, of aviators. Their upturned faces, lit with wrath with malice, with despair, with cynical<br> humor, were covered by long growths of beard, but with the exception of a few who had pined perceptibly away,<br> they seemed to be a well-fed, healthy lot.<br> Braddock Washington drew a garden chair to the edge of the pit and sat down.<br> 'Well, how are you, boys?' he inquired genially.<br> A chorus of execration in which all joined except a few too dispirited to cry out, rose up into the sunny air, but<br> Braddock Washington heard it with unruffled composure. When its last echo had died away he spoke again.<br> 'Have you thought up a way out of your difficulty?'<br> From here and there among them a remark floated up.<br> 'We decided to stay here for love!'<br> 'Bring us up there and we'll find us a way!'<br> Braddock Washington waited until they were again quiet. Then he said:<br> 'I've told you the situation. I don't want you here. I wish to heaven I'd never seen you. Your own curiosity got you<br> here, and any time that you can think of a way out which protects me and my interests I'll be glad to consider it.<br> But so long as you confine your efforts to digging tunnels--yes, I know about the new one you've started--you<br> won't get very far. This isn't as hard on you as you make it out, with all your howling for the loved ones at home.<br> If you were the type who worried much about the loved ones at home, you'd never have taken up aviation.'<br> A tall man moved apart from the others, and held up his hand to call his captor's attention to what he was about to<br> say.<br> 'Let me ask you a few questions!' he cried. 'You pretend to be a fair-minded man.'<br> 'How absurd. How could a man of my position be fair-minded toward you? You might as well speak of a<br> Spaniard being fair-minded toward a piece of steak.'<br> At this harsh observation the faces of the two dozen steaks fell, but the tall man continued:<br> 'All right!' he cried. 'We've argued this out before. You're not a humanitarian and you're not fair-minded, but<br> you're human--at least you say you are--and you ought to be able to put yourself in our place for long enough to<br> think how--how--how----<br> 'How what?' demanded Washington, coldly.<br> '--how unnecessary----'<br> 'Not to me.'<br> 'Well,--how cruel----'<br> 'We've covered that. Cruelty doesn't exist where self-preservation is involved. You've been soldiers; you know<br> that. Try another.'<br> 'Well, then, how stupid.' 'There,' admitted Washington, 'I grant you that. But try to think of an alternative. I've<br> offered to have all or any of you painlessly executed if you wish. I've offered to have your wives, sweethearts,<br> children, and mothers kidnapped and brought out here. I'll enlarge your place down there and feed and clothe you<br> the rest of your lives. If there was some method of producing permanent amnesia I'd have all of you operated on<br> and released immediately, somewhere outside of my preserves. But that's as far as my ideas go.'<br> 'How about trusting us not to peach on you?' cried some one.<br> 'You don't proffer that suggestion seriously,' said Washington, with an expression of scorn. 'I did take out one<br> man to teach my daughter Italian. Last week he got away.'<br> A wild yell of jubilation went up suddenly from two dozen throats and a pandemonium of joy ensued. The<br> prisoners clog-danced and cheered and yodled and wrestled with one another in a sudden uprush of animal<br> spirits. They even ran up the glass sides of the bowl as far as they could, and slid back to the bottom upon the<br> natural cushions of their bodies. The tall man started a song in which they all joined--<br> 'oh, we'll hang the kaiser<br> on a sour apple tree----'<br> Braddock Washington sat in inscrutable silence until the song was over. 'You see,' he remarked, when he could<br> gain a modicum of attention. 'I bear you no ill-will. I like to see you enjoying yourselves. That's why I didn't tell<br> you the whole story at once. The man--what was his name? Critchtichiello? --was shot by some of my agents in<br> fourteen different places.'<br> Not guessing that the places referred to were cities, the tumult of rejoicing subsided immediately.<br> 'Nevertheless,' cried Washington with a touch of anger, 'he tried to run away. Do you expect me to take chances<br> with any of you after an experience like that?'<br> Again a series of ejaculations went up.<br> 'Sure!'<br> 'Would your daughter like to learn Chinese?'<br> 'Hey, I can speak Italian! My mother was a wop.'<br> 'Maybe she'd like t'learna speak N'Yawk!'<br> 'If she's the little one with the big blue eyes I can teach her a lot of things better than Italian.'<br> 'I know some Irish songs--and I could hammer brass once't.<br> Mr. Washington reached forward suddenly with his cane and pushed the button in the grass so that the picture<br> below went out instantly, and there remained only that great dark mouth covered dismally with the black teeth of<br> the grating.<br> 'Hey!' called a single voice from below, 'you ain't goin' away without givin' us your blessing?'<br> But Mr. Washington, followed by the two boys, was already strolling on toward the ninth hole of the golf course,<br> as though the pit and its contents were no more than a hazard over which his facile iron had triumphed with ease.<br> VII<br> JULY UNDER the lee of the diamond mountain was a month of blanket nights and of warm, glowing days. John<br> and Kismine were in love. He did not know that the little gold football (inscribed with the legend Pro deo et<br> patria et St. Midas) which he had given her rested on a platinum chain next to her bosom. But it did. And she for<br> her part was not aware that a large sapphire which had dropped one day from her simple coiffure was stowed<br> away tenderly in John's jewel box.<br> Late one afternoon when the ruby and ermine music room was quiet, they spent an hour there together. He held<br> her hand and she gave him such a look that he whispered her name aloud. She bent toward him--then hesitated.<br> 'Did you say 'Kismine'?' she asked softly, 'or----'<br> She had wanted to be sure. She thought she might have misunderstood.<br> Neither of them had ever kissed before, but in the course of an hour it seemed to make little difference.<br> The afternoon drifted away. That night when a last breath of music drifted down from the highest tower, they each<br> lay awake, happily dreaming over the separate minutes of the day. They had decided to be married as soon as<br> possible.<br> VIII<br> EVERY DAY Mr. Washington and the two young men went hunting or fishing in the deep forests or played golf<br> around the somnolent course--games which John diplomatically allowed his host to win--or swam in the<br> mountain coolness of the lake. John found Mr. Washington a somewhat exacting personality--utterly<br> uninterested in any ideas or opinions except his own. Mrs. Washington was aloof and reserved at all times. She<br> was apparently indifferent to her two daughters, and entirely absorbed in her son Percy, with whom she held<br> interminable conversations in rapid Spanish at dinner.<br> Jasmine, the elder daughter, resembled Kismine in appearance--except that she was somewhat bow-legged, and<br> terminated in large hands and feet--but was utterly unlike her in temperament. Her favorite books had to do with<br> poor girls who kept house for widowed fathers. John learned from Kismine that Jasmine had never recovered<br> from the shock and disappointment caused her by the termination of the World War, just as she was about to start<br> for Europe as a canteen expert. She had even pined away for a time, and Braddock Washington had taken steps to<br> promote a new war in the Balkans--but she had seen a photograph of some wounded Serbian soldiers and lost<br> interest in the whole proceedings. But Percy and Kismine seemed to have inherited the arrogant attitude in all its<br> harsh magnificence from their father. A chaste and consistent selfishness ran like a pattern through their every<br> idea.<br> John was enchanted by the wonders of the ch_teau and the valley. Braddock Washington, so Percy told him, had<br> caused to be kidnapped a landscape gardener, an architect, a designer of state settings, and a French decadent poet<br> left over from the last century. He had put his entire force of negroes at their disposal, guaranteed to supply them<br> with any materials that the world could offer, and left them to work out some ideas of their own. But one by one<br> they had shown their uselessness. The decadent poet had at once begun bewailing his separation from the<br> boulevards in spring--he made some vague remarks about spices, apes, and ivories, but said nothing that was of<br> any practical value. The stage designer on his part wanted to make the whole valley a series of tricks and<br> sensational effects--a state of things that the Washingtons would soon have grown tired of. And as for the<br> architect and the landscape gardener, they thought only in terms of convention. They must make this like this and<br> that like that.<br> But they had, at least, solved the problem of what was to be done with them--they all went mad early one<br> morning after spending the night in a single room trying to agree upon the location of a fountain, and were now<br> confined comfortably in an insane asylum at Westport, Connecticut.<br> 'But,' inquired John curiously, 'who did plan all your wonderful reception rooms and halls, and approaches and<br> bathrooms----?'<br> 'Well,' answered Percy, 'I blush to tell you, but it was a moving-picture fella. He was the only man we found<br> who was used to playing with an unlimited amount of money, though he did tuck his napkin in his collar and<br> couldn't read or write.'<br> As August drew to a close John began to regret that he must soon go back to school. He and Kismine had decided<br> to elope the following June.<br> 'It would be nicer to be married here,' Kismine confessed, 'but of course I could never get father's permission to<br> marry you at all. Next to that I'd rather elope. It's terrible for wealthy people to be married in America at<br> present--they always have to send out bulletins to the press saying that they're going to be married in remnants,<br> when what they mean is just a peck of old second-hand pearls and some used lace worn once by the Empress<br> Eug_nie.'<br> 'I know,' agreed John fervently. 'When I was visiting the Schnlitzer-Murphys, the eldest daughter, Gwendolyn,<br> married a man whose father owns half of West Virginia. She wrote home saying what a tough struggle she was<br> carrying on on his salary as a bank clerk--and then she ended up by saying that 'Thank God, I have four good<br> maids anyhow, and that helps a little.''<br> 'It's absurd,' commented Kismine. 'Think of the millions and millions of people in the world, laborers and all,<br> who get along with only two maids.'<br> One afternoon late in August a chance remark of Kismine's changed the face of the entire situation, and threw<br> John into a state of terror.<br> They were in their favorite grove, and between kisses John was indulging in some romantic forebodings which he<br> fancied added poignancy to their relations.<br> 'Sometimes I think we'll never marry,' he said sadly.<br> 'You're too wealthy, too magnificent. No one as rich as you are can be like other girls. I should marry the<br> daughter of some well-to-do wholesale hardware man from Omaha or Sioux City, and be content with her<br> half-million.'<br> 'I knew the daughter of a wholesale hardware man once,' remarked Kismine. 'I don't think you'd have been<br> contented with her. She was a friend of my sister's. She visited here.'<br> 'Oh, then you've had other guests?' exclaimed John in surprise.<br> Kismine seemed to regret her words.<br> 'Oh, yes,' she said hurriedly, 'we've had a few.'<br> 'But aren't you--wasn't your father afraid they'd talk outside?'<br> 'Oh, to some extent, to some extent,' she answered. 'Let's talk about something pleasanter.'<br> But John's curiosity was aroused.<br> 'Something pleasanter!' he demanded. 'What's unpleasant about that? Weren't they nice girls?'<br> To his great surprise Kismine began to weep.<br> 'Yes--th--that's the--the whole t-trouble. I grew qu-quite attached to some of them. So did Jasmine, but she<br> kept inv-viting them anyway. I couldn't understand it.'<br> A dark suspicion was born in John's heart.<br> 'Do you mean that they told, and your father had them--removed?'<br> 'Worse than that,' she muttered brokenly. 'Father took no chances--and Jasmine kept writing them to come, and<br> they had such a good time!'<br> She was overcome by a paroxysm of grief.<br> Stunned with the horror of this revelation, John sat there open-mouthed, feeling the nerves of his body twitter like<br> so many sparrows perched upon his spinal column.<br> 'Now, I've told you, and I shouldn't have,' she said, calming suddenly and drying her dark blue eyes.<br> 'Do you mean to say that your father had them murdered before they left?'<br> She nodded.<br> 'In August usually--or early in September. It's only natural for us to get all the pleasure out of them that we can<br> first.'<br> 'How abdominable! How--why, I must be going crazy! Did you really admit that--'<br> 'I did,' interrupted Kismine, shrugging her shoulders. 'We can't very well imprison them like those aviators,<br> where they'd be a continual reproach to us every day. And it's always been made easier for Jasmine and me<br> because father had it done sooner than we expected. In that way we avoided any farewell scene----'<br> 'So you murdered them! Uh!' cried John.<br> 'It was done very nicely. They were drugged while they were asleep--and their families were always told that<br> they died of scarlet fever in Butte.'<br> 'But--I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!'<br> 'I didn't,' burst out Kismine. 'I never invited one. Jasmine did. And they always had a very good time. She'd give<br> them the nicest presents toward the last. I shall probably have visitors too--I'll harden up to it. We can't let such<br> an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of enjoying life while we have it. Think how lonesome it'd be out<br> here if we never had any one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed some of their best friends just as we have.'<br> 'And so,' cried John accusingly, 'and so you were letting me make love to you and pretending to return it, and<br> talking about marriage, all the time knowing perfectly well that I'd never get out of here alive--'<br> 'No,' she protested passionately. 'Not any more. I did at first. You were here. I couldn't help that, and I thought<br> your last days might as well be pleasant for both of us. But then I fell in love with you, and--and I'm honestly<br> sorry you're going to--going to be put away--though I'd rather you'd be put away than ever kiss another girl.'<br> 'Oh, you would, would you?' cried John ferociously.<br> 'Much rather. Besides, I've always heard that a girl can have more fun with a man whom she knows she can never<br> marry. Oh, why did I tell you? I've probably spoiled your whole good time now, and we were really enjoying<br> things when you didn't know it. I knew it would make things sort of depressing for you.'<br> 'Oh, you did, did you?' John's voice trembled with anger. 'I've heard about enough of this. If you haven't any<br> more pride and decency than to have an affair with a fellow that you know isn't much better than a corpse, I don't<br> want to have any more to do with you!'<br> 'You're not a corpse!' she protested in horror. 'You're not a corpse! I won't have you saying that I kissed a<br> corpse!'<br> 'I said nothing of the sort!'<br> 'You did! You said I kissed a corpse!'<br> 'I didn't ! '<br> Their voices had risen, but upon a sudden interruption they both subsided into immediate silence. Footsteps were<br> coming along the path in their direction, and a moment later the rose bushes were parted displaying Braddock<br> Washington, whose intelligent eyes set in his good-looking vacuous face were peering in at them.<br> 'Who kissed a corpse?' he demanded in obvious disapproval.<br> 'Nobody,' answered Kismine quickly. 'We were just joking.'<br> 'What are you two doing here, anyhow?' he demanded gruffly. 'Kismine, you ought to be--to be reading or<br> playing golf with your sister. Go read! Go play golf! Don't let me find you here when I come back!'<br> Then he bowed at John and went up the path.<br> 'See?' said Kismine crossly, when he was out of hearing. 'You've spoiled it all. We can never meet any more. He<br> won't let me meet you. He'd have you poisoned if he thought we were in love.'<br> 'We're not, any more!' cried John fiercely, 'so he can set his mind at rest upon that. Moreover, don't fool yourself<br> that I'm going to stay around here. Inside of six hours I'll be over those mountains, if I have to gnaw a passage<br> through them, and on my way East.'<br> They had both got to their feet, and at this remark Kismine came close and put her arm through his.<br> 'I'm going, too.'<br> 'You must be crazy----'<br> 'Of course I'm going,' she interrupted impatiently.<br> 'You most certainly are not. You----'<br> 'Very well,' she said quietly, 'we'll catch up with father now and talk it over with him.'<br> Defeated, John mustered a sickly smile.<br> 'Very well, dearest,' he agreed, with pale and unconvincing affection, 'we'll go together.'<br> His love for her returned and settled placidly on his heart. She was his--she would go with him to share his<br> dangers. He put his arms about her and kissed her fervently. After all she loved him; she had saved him, in fact.<br> Discussing the matter, they walked slowly back toward the ch_teau. They decided that since Braddock<br> Washington had seen them together they had best depart the next night. Nevertheless, John's lips were unusually<br> dry at dinner, and he nervously emptied a great spoonful of peacock soup into his left lung. He had to be carried<br> into the turquoise and sable card-room and pounded on the back by one of the under-butlers, which Percy<br> considered a great joke.<br> IX<br> LONG AFTER midnight John's body gave a nervous jerk, and he sat suddenly upright, staring into the veils of<br> somnolence that draped the room. Through the squares of blue darkness that were his open windows, he had<br> heard a faint far-away sound that died upon a bed of wind before identifying itself on his memory, clouded with<br> uneasy dreams. But the sharp noise that had succeeded it was nearer, was just outside the room--the click of a<br> turned knob, a footstep, a whisper, he could not tell; a hard lump gathered in the pit of his stomach, and his whole<br> body ached in the moment that he strained agonizingly to hear. Then one of the veils seemed to dissolve, and he<br> saw a vague figure standing by the door, a figure only faintly limned and blocked in upon the darkness, mingled<br> so with the folds of the drapery as to seem distorted, like a reflection seen in a dirty pane of glass.<br> With a sudden movement of fright or resolution John pressed the button by his bedside, and the next moment he<br> was sitting in the green sunken bath of the adjoining room, waked into alertness by the shock of the cold water<br> which half filled it.<br> He sprang out, and, his wet pajamas scattering a heavy trickle of water behind him, ran for the aquamarine door<br> which he knew led out onto the ivory landing of the second floor. The door opened noiselessly. A single crimson<br> lamp burning in a great dome above lit the magnificent sweep of the carved stairways with a poignant beauty. For<br> a moment John hesitated, appalled by the silent splendor massed about him, seeming to envelop in its gigantic<br> folds and contours the solitary drenched little figure shivering upon the ivory landing. Then simultaneously two<br> things happened. The door of his own sitting-room swung open, precipitating three naked negroes into the<br> hall--and, as John swayed in wild terror toward the stairway, another door slid back in the wall on the other side<br> of the corridor, and John saw Braddock Washington standing in the lighted lift, wearing a fur coat and a pair of<br> riding boots which reached to his knees and displayed, above, the glow of his rose-colored pajamas.<br> On the instant the three negroes--John had never seen any of them before, and it flashed through his mind that<br> they must be the professional executioners--paused in their movement toward John, and turned expectantly to the<br> man in the lift, who burst out with an imperious command:<br> 'Get in here! All three of you! Quick as hell!'<br> Then, within the instant, the three negroes darted into the cage, the oblong of light was blotted out as the lift door<br> slid shut, and John was again alone in the hall. He slumped weakly down against an ivory stair.<br> It was apparent that something portentous had occurred, something which, for the moment at least, had postponed<br> his own petty disaster. What was it? Had the negroes risen in revolt? Had the aviators forced aside the iron bars of<br> the grating? Or had the men of Fish stumbled blindly through the hills and gazed with bleak, joyless eyes upon the<br> gaudy valley? John did not know. He heard a faint whir of air as the lift whizzed up again, and then, a moment<br> later, as it descended. It was probable that Percy was hurrying to his father's assistance, and it occurred to John<br> that this was his opportunity to join Kismine and plan an immediate escape. He waited until the lift had been<br> silent for several minutes; shivering a little with the night cool that whipped in through his wet pajamas, he<br> returned to his room and dressed himself quickly. Then he mounted a long flight of stairs and turned down the<br> corridor carpeted with Russian sable which led to Kismine's suite.<br> The door of her sitting-room was open and the lamps were lighted. Kismine, in an angora kimono, stood near the<br> window of the room in a listening attitude, and as John entered noiselessly she turned toward him.<br> 'Oh, it's you!' she whispered, crossing the room to him. 'Did you hear them?'<br> 'I heard your father's slaves in my----'<br> 'No,' she interrupted excitedly. 'Aeroplanes!'<br> 'Aeroplanes? Perhaps that was the sound that woke me.'<br> 'There're at least a dozen. I saw one a few moments ago dead against the moon. The guard back by the cliff fired<br> his rifle and that's what roused father. We're going to open on them right away.'<br> 'Are they here on purpose?'<br> 'Yes--it's that Italian who got away----'<br> Simultaneously with her last word, a succession of sharp cracks tumbled in through the open window. Kismine<br> uttered a little cry, took a penny with fumbling fingers from a box on her dresser, and ran to one of the electric<br> lights. In an instant the entire ch_teau was in darkness--she had blown out the fuse.<br> 'Come on!' she cried to him. 'We'll go up to the roof garden, and watch it from there!'<br> Drawing a cape about her, she took his hand, and they found their way out the door. It was only a step to the<br> tower lift, and as she pressed the button that shot them upward he put his arms around her in the darkness and<br> kissed her mouth. Romance had come to John Unger at last. A minute later they had stepped out upon the<br> star-white platform. Above, under the misty moon, sliding in and out of the patches of cloud that eddied below it,<br> floated a dozen dark-winged bodies in a constant circling course. From here and there in the valley flashes of fire<br> leaped toward them, followed by sharp detonations. Kismine clapped her hands with pleasure, which, a moment<br> later, turned to dismay as the aeroplanes at some prearranged signal, began to release their bombs and the whole<br> of the valley became a panorama of deep reverberate sound and lurid light.<br> Before long the aim of the attackers became concentrated upon the points where the anti-aircraft guns were<br> situated, and one of them was almost immediately reduced to a giant cinder to lie smouldering in a park of rose<br> bushes.<br> 'Kismine,' begged John, 'you'll be glad when I tell you that this attack came on the eve of my murder. If I hadn't<br> heard that guard shoot off his gun back by the pass I should now be stone dead----'<br> 'I can't hear you!' cried Kismine, intent on the scene before her. 'You'll have to talk louder!'<br> 'I simply said, ' shouted John, 'that we'd better get out before they begin to shell the ch_teau!'<br> Suddenly the whole portico of the negro quarters cracked asunder, a geyser of flame shot up from under the<br> colonnades, and great fragments of jagged marble were hurled as far as the borders of the lake.<br> 'There go fifty thousand dollars' worth of slaves,' cried Kismine, 'at prewar prices. So few Americans have any<br> respect for property.'<br> John renewed his efforts to compel her to leave. The aim of the aeroplanes was becoming more precise minute by<br> minute, and only two of the antiaircraft guns were still retaliating. It was obvious that the garrison, encircled with<br> fire, could not hold out much longer.<br> 'Come on!' cried John, pulling Kismine's arm, 'we've got to go. Do you realize that those aviators will kill you<br> without question if they find you ?'<br> She consented reluctantly.<br> 'We'll have to wake Jasmine!' she said, as they hurried toward the lift. Then she added in a sort of childish<br> delight: 'We'll be poor, won't we? Like people in books. And I'll be an orphan and utterly free. Free and poor!<br> What fun!' She stopped and raised her lips to him in a delighted kiss.<br> 'It's impossible to be both together,' said John grimly. 'People have found that out. And I should choose to be<br> free as preferable of the two. As an extra caution you'd better dump the contents of your jewel box into your<br> pockets.'<br> Ten minutes later the two girls met John in the dark corridor and they descended to the main floor of the ch_teau.<br> Passing for the last time through the magnificence of the splendid halls, they stood for a moment out on the<br> terrace, watching the burning negro quarters and the flaming embers of two planes which had fallen on the other<br> side of the lake. A solitary gun was still keeping up a sturdy popping, and the attackers seemed timorous about<br> descending lower, but sent their thunderous fireworks in a circle around it, until any chance shot might annihilate<br> its Ethiopian crew.<br> John and the two sisters passed down the marble steps, turned sharply to the left, and began to ascend a narrow<br> path that wound like a garter about the diamond mountain. Kismine knew a heavily wooded spot half-way up<br> where they could lie concealed and yet be able to observe the wild night in the valley--finally to make an escape,<br> when it should be necessary, along a secret path laid in a rocky gully.<br> X<br> IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK when they attained their destination. The obliging and phlegmatic Jasmine fell off to<br> sleep immediately, leaning against the trunk of a large tree, while John and Kismine sat, his arm around her, and<br> watched the desperate ebb and flow of the dying battle among the ruins of a vista that had been a garden spot that<br> morning. Shortly after four o'clock the last remaining gun gave out a clanging sound and went out of action in a<br> swift tongue of red smoke. Though the moon was down, they saw that the flying bodies were circling closer to the<br> earth. When the planes had made certain that the beleaguered possessed no further resources, they would land and<br> the dark and glittering reign of the Washingtons would be over.<br> With the cessation of the firing the valley grew quiet. The embers of the two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes of<br> some monster crouching in the grass. The ch_teau stood dark and silent, beautiful without light as it had been<br> beautiful in the sun, while the woody rattles of Nemesis filled the air above with a growing and receding<br> complaint. Then John perceived that Kismine, like her sister, had fallen sound asleep.<br> It was long after four when he became aware of footsteps along the path they had lately followed, and he waited<br> in breathless silence until the persons to whom they belonged had passed the vantage-point he occupied. There<br> was a faint stir in the air now that was not of human origin, and the dew was cold; he knew that the dawn would<br> break soon. John waited until the steps had gone a safe distance up the mountain and were inaudible. Then he<br> followed. About half-way to the steep summit the trees fell away and a hard saddle of rock spread itself over the<br> diamond beneath. Just before he reached this point he slowed down his pace, warned by an animal sense that there<br> was life just ahead of him. Coming to a high boulder, he lifted his head gradually above its edge. His curiosity<br> was rewarded; this is what he saw:<br> Braddock Washington was standing there motionless, silhouetted against the gray sky without sound or sign of<br> life. As the dawn came up out of the east, lending a cold green color to the earth, it brought the solitary figure into<br> insignificant contrast with the new day.<br> While John watched, his host remained for a few moments absorbed in some inscrutable contemplation; then he<br> signalled to the two negroes who crouched at his feet to lift the burden which lay between them. As they struggled<br> upright, the first yellow beam of the sun struck through the innumerable prisms of an immense and exquisitely<br> chiselled diamond--and a white radiance was kindled that glowed upon the air like a fragment of the morning<br> star. The bearers staggered beneath its weight for a moment--then their rippling muscles caught and hardened<br> under the wet shine of the skins and the three figures were again motionless in their defiant impotency before the<br> heavens.<br> After a while the white man lifted his head and slowly raised his arms in a gesture of attention, as one who would<br> call a great crowd to hear--but there was no crowd, only the vast silence of the mountain and the sky, broken by<br> faint bird voices down among the trees. The figure on the saddle of rock began to speak ponderously and with an<br> inextinguishable pride.<br> 'You out there--' he cried in a trembling voice. 'You-- there--!' He paused, his arms still uplifted, his head<br> held attentively as though he were expecting an answer. John strained his eyes to see whether there might be men<br> coming down the mountain, but the mountain was bare of human life. There was only sky and a mocking flute of<br> wind along the tree-tops. Could Washington be praying? For a moment John wondered. Then the illusion<br> passed--there was something in the man's whole attitude antithetical to prayer.<br> 'Oh, you above there!'<br> The voice was become strong and confident. This was no forlorn supplication. If anything, there was in it a<br> quality of monstrous condescension.<br> 'You there----'<br> Words, too quickly uttered to be understood, flowing one into the other. . . . John listened breathlessly, catching a<br> phrase here and there, while the voice broke off, resumed, broke off again--now strong and argumentative, now<br> colored with a slow, puzzled impatience. Then a conviction commenced to dawn on the single listener, and as<br> realization crept over him a spray of quick blood rushed through his arteries. Braddock Washington was offering<br> a bribe to God!<br> That was it--there was no doubt. The diamond in the arms of his slaves was some advance sample, a promise of<br> more to follow.<br> That, John perceived after a time, was the thread running through his sentences. Prometheus Enriched was calling<br> to witness forgotten sacrifices, forgotten rituals, prayers obsolete before the birth of Christ. For a while his<br> discourse took the form of reminding God of this gift or that which Divinity had deigned to accept from<br> men--great churches if he would rescue cities from the plague, gifts of myrrh and gold, of human lives and<br> beautiful women and captive armies, of children and queens, of beasts of the forest and field, sheep and goats,<br> harvests and cities, whole conquered lands that had been offered up in lust or blood for His appeasal, buying a<br> meed's worth of alleviation from the Divine wrath--and now he, Braddock Washington, Emperor of Diamonds,<br> king and priest of the age of gold, arbiter of splendor and luxury, would offer up a treasure such as princes before<br> him had never dreamed of, offer it up not in suppliance, but in pride.<br> He would give to God, he continued, getting down to specifications, the greatest diamond in the world. This<br> diamond would be cut with many more thousand facets than there were leaves on a tree, and yet the whole<br> diamond would be shaped with the perfection of a stone no bigger than a fly. Many men would work upon it for<br> many years. It would be set in a great dome of beaten gold, wonderfully carved and equipped with gates of opal<br> and crusted sapphire. In the middle would be hollowed out a chapel presided over by an altar of iridescent,<br> decomposing, ever-changing radium which would burn out the eyes of any worshipper who lifted up his head<br> from prayer--and on this altar there would be slain for the amusement of the Divine Benefactor any victim He<br> should choose, even though it should be the greatest and most powerful man alive.<br> In return he asked only a simple thing, a thing that for God would be absurdly easy--only that matters should be<br> as they were yesterday at this hour and that they should so remain. So very simple! Let but the heavens open,<br> swallowing these men and their aeroplanes--and then close again. Let him have his slaves once more, restored to<br> life and well.<br> There was no one else with whom he had ever needed to treat or bargain.<br> He doubted only whether he had made his bribe big enough. God had His price, of course. God was made in<br> man's image, so it had been said: He must have His price. And the price would be rare--no cathedral whose<br> building consumed many years, no pyramid constructed by ten thousand workmen, would be like this cathedral,<br> this pyramid.<br> He paused here. That was his proposition. Everything would be up to specifications and there was nothing vulgar<br> in his assertion that it would be cheap at the price. He implied that Providence could take it or leave it.<br> As he approached the end his sentences became broken, became short and uncertain, and his body seemed tense,<br> seemed strained to catch the slightest pressure or whisper of life in the spaces around him. His hair had turned<br> gradually white as he talked, and now he lifted his head high to the heavens like a prophet of old--magnificently<br> mad.<br> Then, as John stared in giddy fascination, it seemed to him that a curious phenomenon took place somewhere<br> around him. It was as though the sky had darkened for an instant, as though there had been a sudden murmur in a<br> gust of wind, a sound of far-away trumpets, a sighing like the rustle of a great silken robe--for a time the whole<br> of nature round about partook of this darkness; the birds' song ceased; the trees were still, and far over the<br> mountain there was a mutter of dull, menacing thunder.<br> That was all. The wind died along the tall grasses of the valley. The dawn and the day resumed their place in a<br> time, and the risen sun sent hot waves of yellow mist that made its path bright before it. The leaves laughed in the<br> sun, and their laughter shook the trees until each bough was like a girl's school in fairyland. God had refused to<br> accept the bribe.<br> For another moment John watched the triumph of the day. Then, turning he saw a flutter of brown down by the<br> lake, then another flutter, then another, like the dance of golden angels alighting from the clouds. The aeroplanes<br> had come to earth.<br> John slid off the boulder and ran down the side of the mountain to the clump of trees, where the two girls were<br> awake and waiting for him. Kismine sprang to her feet, the jewels in her pockets jingling, a question on her parted<br> lips, but instinct told John that there was no time for words. They must get off the mountain without losing a<br> moment. He seized a hand of each and in silence they threaded the tree-trunks, washed with light now and with<br> the rising mist. Behind them from the valley came no sound at all, except the complaint of the peacocks far away<br> and the pleasant undertone of morning.<br> When they had gone about half a mile, they avoided the park land and entered a narrow path that led over the next<br> rise of ground. At the highest point of this they paused and turned around. Their eyes rested upon the<br> mountainside they had just left--oppressed by some dark sense of tragic impendency.<br> Clear against the sky a broken, white-haired man was slowly descending the steep slope, followed by two<br> gigantic and emotionless negroes, who carried a burden between them which still flashed and glittered in the sun.<br> Half-way down two other figures joined them--John could see that they were Mrs. Washington and her son,<br> upon whose arm she leaned. The aviators had clambered from their machines to the sweeping lawn in front of the<br> ch_teau, and with rifles in hand were starting up the diamond mountain in skirmishing formation.<br> But the little group of five which had formed farther up and was engrossing all the watchers' attention had stopped<br> upon a ledge of rock. The negroes stooped and pulled up what appeared to be a trap-door in the side of the<br> mountain. Into this they all disappeared, the white-haired man first, then his wife and son, finally the two<br> negroes, the glittering tips of whose jeweled head-dresses caught the sun for a moment before the trap-door<br> descended and engulfed them all.<br> Kismine clutched John's arm.<br> 'Oh,' she cried wildly, 'where are they going? What are they going to do?'<br> 'It must be some underground way of escape '<br> A little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence.<br> 'Don't you see?' sobbed Kismine hysterically. 'The mountain is wired!'<br> Even as she spoke John put up his hands to shield his sight. Before their eyes the whole surface of the mountain<br> had changed suddenly to a dazzling burning yellow, which showed up through the jacket of turf as light shows<br> through a human hand. For a moment the intolerable glow continued, and then like an extinguished filament it<br> disappeared, revealing a black waste from which blue smoke arose slowly, carrying off with it what remained of<br> vegetation and of human flesh. Of the aviators there was left neither blood, nor bone--they were consumed as<br> completely as the five souls who had gone inside.<br> Simultaneously, and with an immense concussion, the ch_teau literally threw itself into the air, bursting into<br> flaming fragments as it rose, and then tumbling back upon itself in a smoking pile that lay projecting half into the<br> water of the lake. There was no fire--what smoke there was drifted off mingling with the sunshine, and for a few<br> minutes longer a powdery dust of marble drifted from the great featureless pile that had once been the house of<br> jewels. There was no more sound and the three people were alone in the valley.<br> XI<br> AT SUNSET John and his two companions reached the high cliff which had marked the boundaries of the<br> Washingtons' dominion, and looking back found the valley tranquil and lovely in the dusk. They sat down to<br> finish the food which Jasmine had brought with her in a basket.<br> 'There!' she said, as she spread the table-cloth and put the sandwiches in a neat pile upon it. 'Don't they look<br> tempting? I always think that food tastes better outdoors.'<br> 'With that remark,' remarked Kismine, 'Jasmine enters the middle class.'<br> 'Now,' said John eagerly, 'turn out your pocket and let's see what jewels you brought along. If you made a good<br> selection we three ought to live comfortably all the rest of our lives.'<br> Obediently Kismine put her hand in her pocket and tossed two handfuls of glittering stones before him.<br> 'Not so bad,' cried John, enthusiastically. 'They aren't very big, but-- Hello!' His expression changed as he held<br> one of them up to the declining sun. 'Why, these aren't diamonds! There's something the matter!'<br> 'By golly!' exclaimed Kismine, with a startled look. 'What an idiot I am!'<br> 'Why, these are rhinestones!' cried John.<br> 'I know.' She broke into a laugh. 'I opened the wrong drawer. They belonged on the dress of a girl who visited<br> Jasmine. I got her to give them to me in exchange for diamonds. I'd never seen anything but precious stones<br> before.'<br> 'And this is what you brought?'<br> 'I'm afraid so.' She fingered the brilliants wistfully. 'I think I like these better. I'm a little tired of diamonds.'<br> 'Very well,' said John gloomily. 'We'll have to live in Hades. And you will grow old telling incredulous women<br> that you got the wrong drawer. Unfortunately your father's bank-books were consumed with him.'<br> 'Well, what's the matter with Hades?'<br> 'If I come home with a wife at my age my father is just as liable as not to cut me off with a hot coal, as they say<br> down there.'<br> Jasmine spoke up.<br> 'I love washing,' she said quietly. 'I have always washed my own handkerchiefs. I'll take in laundry and support<br> you both.'<br> 'Do they have washwomen in Hades?' asked Kismine innocently.<br> 'Of course,' answered John. 'It's just like anywhere else.'<br> 'I thought--perhaps it was too hot to wear any clothes.'<br> John laughed.<br> 'Just try it!' he suggested. 'They'll run you out before you're half started.'<br> 'Will father be there?' she asked.<br> John turned to her in astonishment.<br> 'Your father is dead,' he replied somberly. 'Why should he go to Hades? You have it confused with another place<br> that was abolished long ago.'<br> After supper they folded up the table-cloth and spread their blankets for the night.<br> 'What a dream it was,' Kismine sighed, gazing up at the stars. 'How strange it seems to be here with one dress<br> and a penniless fianc_!<br> 'Under the stars,' she repeated. 'I never noticed the stars before. I always thought of them as great big diamonds<br> that belonged to some one. Now they frighten me. They make me feel that it was all a dream, all my youth.'<br> 'It was a dream,' said John quietly. 'Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.'<br> 'How pleasant then to be insane!'<br> 'So I'm told,' said John gloomily. 'I don't know any longer. At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so,<br> you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try. There are only diamonds in the whole world,<br> diamonds and perhaps the shabby gift of disillusion. Well, I have that last and I will make the usual nothing of it.'<br> He shivered. 'Turn up your coat collar, little girl, the night's full of chill and you'll get pneumonia. His was a great<br> sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.'<br> So wrapping himself in his blanket he fell off to sleep."
