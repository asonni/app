Stay with me here!<br>Were the vows you swore deceiving, deceiving?<br>No, I promised to love you, dear,<br>But I must be leaving.<br><br>O it's broken the lock and splintered the door,<br>O it's the gate where they're turning, turning;<br>Their boots are heavy on the floor<br>And their eyes are burning."
