				"main_text": "The awful shadow of some unseen Power<br> Floats though unseen among us; visiting<br> This various world with as inconstant wing<br> As summer winds that creep from flower to flower;<br> Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower, <br> It visits with inconstant glance<br> Each human heart and countenance;<br> Like hues and harmonies of evening,<br> Like clouds in starlight widely spread,<br> Like memory of music fled, <br> Like aught that for its grace may be<br> Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery.<br><br> Spirit of BEAUTY, that dost consecrate<br> With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon<br> Of human thought or form, where art thou gone? <br> Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,<br> This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?<br> Ask why the sunlight not for ever<br> Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river,<br> Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown, <br> Why fear and dream and death and birth<br> Cast on the daylight of this earth<br> Such gloom, why man has such a scope<br> For love and hate, despondency and hope?<br><br> No voice from some sublimer world hath ever <br> To sage or poet these responses given:<br> Therefore the names of God and ghosts and Heaven,<br> Remain the records of their vain endeavour:<br> Frail spells whose uttered charm might not avail to sever,<br> From all we hear and all we see, <br> Doubt, chance and mutability.<br> Thy light alone like mist o'er mountains driven,<br> Or music by the night-wind sent<br> Through strings of some still instrument,<br> Or moonlight on a midnight stream, <br> Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream.<br><br> Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds depart<br> And come, for some uncertain moments lent.<br> Man were immortal and omnipotent,<br> Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art, <br> Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart.<br> Thou messenger of sympathies,<br> That wax and wane in lovers' eyes;<br> Thou, that to human thought art nourishment,<br> Like darkness to a dying flame! <br> Depart not as thy shadow came,<br> Depart not--lest the grave should be,<br> Like life and fear, a dark reality.<br><br> While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped<br> Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin, <br> And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing<br> Hopes of high talk with the departed dead.<br> I called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed;<br> I was not heard; I saw them not;<br> When musing deeply on the lot <br> Of life, at that sweet time when winds are wooing<br> All vital things that wake to bring<br> News of buds and blossoming,<br> Sudden, thy shadow fell on me;<br> I shrieked, and clasped my hands in ecstasy! <br><br> I vowed that I would dedicate my powers<br> To thee and thine: have I not kept the vow?<br> With beating heart and streaming eyes, even now<br> I call the phantoms of a thousand hours<br> Each from his voiceless grave: they have in visioned bowers <br> Of studious zeal or love's delight<br> Outwatched with me the envious night:<br> They know that never joy illumed my brow<br> Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free<br> This world from its dark slavery, <br> That thou, O awful LOVELINESS,<br> Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express.<br><br> The day becomes more solemn and serene<br> When noon is past; there is a harmony<br> In autumn, and a lustre in its sky, <br> Which through the summer is not heard or seen,<br> As if it could not be, as if it had not been!<br> Thus let thy power, which like the truth<br> Of nature on my passive youth<br> Descended, to my onward life supply <br> Its calm, to one who worships thee,<br> And every form containing thee,<br> Whom, SPIRIT fair, thy spells did bind<br> To fear himself, and love all human kind."
