						},"shuffle": "true","main_text":"CHAPTER I. The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.<br><br> In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second<br> quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the<br> name of Canty, who did not want him. On the same day another English<br> child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.<br> All England wanted him too. England had so longed for him, and hoped<br> for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the<br> people went nearly mad for joy. Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed<br> each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich<br> and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they<br> kept this up for days and nights together. By day, London was a sight<br> to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and<br> splendid pageants marching along. By night, it was again a sight<br> to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of<br> revellers making merry around them. There was no talk in all England<br> but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in<br> silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that<br> great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him--and not<br> caring, either. But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty,<br> lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had<br> just come to trouble with his presence.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER II. Tom's early life.<br><br> Let us skip a number of years.<br><br> London was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that<br> day. It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many.<br> The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the<br> part where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge. The<br> houses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first,<br> and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second. The higher<br> the houses grew, the broader they grew. They were skeletons of strong<br> criss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.<br> The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner's<br> taste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look. The windows<br> were small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened<br> outward, on hinges, like doors.<br><br> The house which Tom's father lived in was up a foul little pocket called<br> Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane. It was small, decayed, and rickety,<br> but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty's tribe<br> occupied a room on the third floor. The mother and father had a sort of<br> bedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,<br> Bet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves,<br> and might sleep where they chose. There were the remains of a blanket<br> or two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not<br> rightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked<br> into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at<br> night, for service.<br><br> Bet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins. They were good-hearted<br> girls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant. Their mother<br> was like them. But the father and the grandmother were a couple of<br> fiends. They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other<br> or anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk<br> or sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar. They made<br> beggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them. Among,<br> but not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old<br> priest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of<br> a few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them<br> right ways secretly. Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and<br> how to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls,<br> but they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have<br> endured such a queer accomplishment in them.<br><br> All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty's house.<br> Drunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and<br> nearly all night long. Broken heads were as common as hunger in that<br> place. Yet little Tom was not unhappy. He had a hard time of it, but<br> did not know it. It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys<br> had, therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.<br> When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would<br> curse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful<br> grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away<br> in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any<br> miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going<br> hungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of<br> treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband.<br><br> No, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer. He only<br> begged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were<br> stringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time<br> listening to good Father Andrew's charming old tales and legends<br> about giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and<br> gorgeous kings and princes. His head grew to be full of these wonderful<br> things, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and<br> offensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he<br> unleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in<br> delicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince<br> in a regal palace. One desire came in time to haunt him day and night:<br> it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes. He spoke of it once to<br> some of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so<br> unmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.<br><br> He often read the priest's old books and got him to explain and enlarge<br> upon them. His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him,<br> by-and-by. His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his<br> shabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.<br> He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but,<br> instead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it,<br> he began to find an added value in it because of the washings and<br> cleansings it afforded.<br><br> Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in<br> Cheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London<br> had a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was<br> carried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer's day he saw<br> poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and<br> heard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.<br> Yes, Tom's life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.<br><br> By-and-by Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a<br> strong effect upon him that he began to _act_ the prince, unconsciously.<br> His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the<br> vast admiration and amusement of his intimates. But Tom's influence<br> among these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he<br> came to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a<br> superior being. He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such<br> marvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise! Tom's remarks,<br> and Tom's performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and<br> these, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him<br> as a most gifted and extraordinary creature. Full-grown people brought<br> their perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the<br> wit and wisdom of his decisions. In fact he was become a hero to all<br> who knew him except his own family--these, only, saw nothing in him.<br><br> Privately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court! He was the<br> prince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords<br> and ladies in waiting, and the royal family. Daily the mock prince was<br> received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic<br> readings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed<br> in the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his<br> imaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.<br><br> After which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat<br> his poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch<br> himself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs<br> in his dreams.<br><br> And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,<br> grew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed<br> all other desires, and became the one passion of his life.<br><br> One January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up<br> and down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour<br> after hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and<br> longing for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed<br> there--for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,<br> judging by the smell, they were--for it had never been his good luck to<br> own and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was<br> murky; it was a melancholy day. At night Tom reached home so wet and<br> tired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother<br> to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved--after their fashion;<br> wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.<br> For a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting<br> going on in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts<br> drifted away to far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company<br> of jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had<br> servants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders. And<br> then, as usual, he dreamed that _he_ was a princeling himself.<br><br> All night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved<br> among great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,<br> drinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of<br> the glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a<br> smile, and there a nod of his princely head.<br><br> And when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness<br> about him, his dream had had its usual effect--it had intensified the<br> sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold. Then came bitterness,<br> and heart-break, and tears.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER III. Tom's meeting with the Prince.<br><br> Tom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy<br> with the shadowy splendours of his night's dreams. He wandered here<br> and there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what<br> was happening around him. People jostled him, and some gave him rough<br> speech; but it was all lost on the musing boy. By-and-by he found<br> himself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in<br> that direction. He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his<br> imaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London. The Strand<br> had ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,<br> but by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably<br> compact row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered<br> great buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with<br> ample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river--grounds that are<br> now closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.<br><br> Tom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the<br> beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then<br> idled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal's<br> stately palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace<br> beyond--Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of<br> masonry, the wide-spreading wings, the frowning bastions and turrets,<br> the huge stone gateway, with its gilded bars and its magnificent array<br> of colossal granite lions, and other the signs and symbols of English<br> royalty. Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last? Here,<br> indeed, was a king's palace. Might he not hope to see a prince now--a<br> prince of flesh and blood, if Heaven were willing?<br><br> At each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue--that is to say,<br> an erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel<br> in shining steel armour. At a respectful distance were many country<br> folk, and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of<br> royalty that might offer. Splendid carriages, with splendid people<br> in them and splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by<br> several other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.<br><br> Poor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and<br> timidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when<br> all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that<br> almost made him shout for joy. Within was a comely boy, tanned and<br> brown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all<br> of lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little<br> jewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;<br> and on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened<br> with a great sparkling gem. Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his<br> servants, without a doubt. Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living<br> prince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer<br> of the pauper-boy's heart was answered at last.<br><br> Tom's breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big<br> with wonder and delight. Everything gave way in his mind instantly<br> to one desire: that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,<br> devouring look at him. Before he knew what he was about, he had his<br> face against the gate-bars. The next instant one of the soldiers<br> snatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd<br> of country gawks and London idlers. The soldier said,--<br><br> ‘Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!’<br><br> The crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate<br> with his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried<br> out,--<br><br> ‘How dar'st thou use a poor lad like that? How dar'st thou use the King<br> my father's meanest subject so? Open the gates, and let him in!’<br><br> You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then.<br> You should have heard them cheer, and shout, ‘Long live the Prince of<br> Wales!’<br><br> The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates,<br> and presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his<br> fluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.<br><br> Edward Tudor said--<br><br> ‘Thou lookest tired and hungry: thou'st been treated ill. Come with<br> me.’<br><br> Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don't know what; interfere,<br> no doubt. But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and<br> they stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues. Edward<br> took Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.<br> By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered<br> before except in books. The prince, with princely delicacy and<br> breeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be<br> embarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked<br> questions while Tom ate.<br><br> ‘What is thy name, lad?’<br><br> ‘Tom Canty, an' it please thee, sir.’<br><br> ‘'Tis an odd one. Where dost live?’<br><br> ‘In the city, please thee, sir. Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.’<br><br> ‘Offal Court! Truly 'tis another odd one. Hast parents?’<br><br> ‘Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently<br> precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin<br> sisters, Nan and Bet.’<br><br> ‘Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?’<br><br> ‘Neither to any other is she, so please your worship. She hath a wicked<br> heart, and worketh evil all her days.’<br><br> ‘Doth she mistreat thee?’<br><br> ‘There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with<br> drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to<br> me with goodly beatings.’<br><br> A fierce look came into the little prince's eyes, and he cried out--<br><br> ‘What! Beatings?’<br><br> ‘Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.’<br><br> ‘_Beatings_!--and thou so frail and little. Hark ye: before the night<br> come, she shall hie her to the Tower. The King my father’--<br><br> ‘In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. The Tower is for the great<br> alone.’<br><br> ‘True, indeed. I had not thought of that. I will consider of her<br> punishment. Is thy father kind to thee?’<br><br> ‘Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.’<br><br> ‘Fathers be alike, mayhap. Mine hath not a doll's temper. He smiteth<br> with a heavy hand, yet spareth me: he spareth me not always with his<br> tongue, though, sooth to say. How doth thy mother use thee?’<br><br> ‘She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.<br> And Nan and Bet are like to her in this.’<br><br> ‘How old be these?’<br><br> ‘Fifteen, an' it please you, sir.’<br><br> ‘The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey,<br> my cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but<br> my sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you: do thy<br> sisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their<br> souls?’<br><br> ‘They? Oh, dost think, sir, that _they_ have servants?’<br><br> The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then<br> said--<br><br> ‘And prithee, why not? Who helpeth them undress at night? Who attireth<br> them when they rise?’<br><br> ‘None, sir. Would'st have them take off their garment, and sleep<br> without--like the beasts?’<br><br> ‘Their garment! Have they but one?’<br><br> ‘Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more? Truly they have<br> not two bodies each.’<br><br> ‘It is a quaint and marvellous thought! Thy pardon, I had not meant<br> to laugh. But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys<br> enow, and that soon, too: my cofferer shall look to it. No, thank me<br> not; 'tis nothing. Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.<br> Art learned?’<br><br> ‘I know not if I am or not, sir. The good priest that is called Father<br> Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.’<br><br> ‘Know'st thou the Latin?’<br><br> ‘But scantly, sir, I doubt.’<br><br> ‘Learn it, lad: 'tis hard only at first. The Greek is harder; but<br> neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady<br> Elizabeth and my cousin. Thou should'st hear those damsels at it! But<br> tell me of thy Offal Court. Hast thou a pleasant life there?’<br><br> ‘In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There<br> be Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so<br> bravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout<br> and fight till all are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and costeth but<br> a farthing--albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing, please your<br> worship.’<br><br> ‘Tell me more.’<br><br> ‘We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,<br> like to the fashion of the 'prentices, sometimes.’<br><br> The prince's eyes flashed. Said he--<br><br> ‘Marry, that would not I mislike. Tell me more.’<br><br> ‘We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.’<br><br> ‘That would I like also. Speak on.’<br><br> ‘In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and<br> each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and<br> shout and tumble and--’<br><br> ‘'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go<br> on.’<br><br> ‘We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,<br> each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh<br> the lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the<br> world!--we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship's<br> presence.’<br><br> ‘Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious! If that I could but clothe me<br> in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,<br> just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego<br> the crown!’<br><br> ‘And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just<br> once--’<br><br> ‘Oho, would'st like it? Then so shall it be. Doff thy rags, and don<br> these splendours, lad! It is a brief happiness, but will be not less<br> keen for that. We will have it while we may, and change again before<br> any come to molest.’<br><br> A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom's<br> fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked<br> out in the gaudy plumage of royalty. The two went and stood side by<br> side before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to<br> have been any change made! They stared at each other, then at the<br> glass, then at each other again. At last the puzzled princeling said--<br><br> ‘What dost thou make of this?’<br><br> ‘Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer. It is not meet that<br> one of my degree should utter the thing.’<br><br> ‘Then will _I_ utter it. Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the<br> same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and<br> countenance that I bear. Fared we forth naked, there is none could<br> say which was you, and which the Prince of Wales. And, now that I<br> am clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more<br> nearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not<br> this a bruise upon your hand?’<br><br> ‘Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor<br> man-at-arms--’<br><br> ‘Peace! It was a shameful thing and a cruel!’ cried the little prince,<br> stamping his bare foot. ‘If the King--Stir not a step till I come<br> again! It is a command!’<br><br> In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national<br> importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying<br> through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and<br> glowing eyes. As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,<br> and tried to shake them, shouting--<br><br> ‘Open! Unbar the gates!’<br><br> The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince<br> burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier<br> fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the<br> roadway, and said--<br><br> ‘Take that, thou beggar's spawn, for what thou got'st me from his<br> Highness!’<br><br> The crowd roared with laughter. The prince picked himself out of the<br> mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--<br><br> ‘I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for<br> laying thy hand upon me!’<br><br> The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--<br><br> ‘I salute your gracious Highness.’ Then angrily--’Be off, thou crazy<br> rubbish!’<br><br> Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled<br> him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--<br><br> ‘Way for his Royal Highness! Way for the Prince of Wales!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER IV. The Prince's troubles begin.<br><br> After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was<br> at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself. As long as he had<br> been able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and<br> royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very<br> entertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was<br> no longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.<br> He looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality. He<br> was within the city of London--that was all he knew. He moved on,<br> aimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by<br> were infrequent. He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed<br> then where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed<br> on, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered<br> houses in it, and a prodigious church. He recognised this church.<br> Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was<br> undergoing elaborate repairs. The prince took heart at once--he felt<br> that his troubles were at an end, now. He said to himself, ‘It is the<br> ancient Grey Friars' Church, which the king my father hath taken from<br> the monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children,<br> and new-named it Christ's Church. Right gladly will they serve the son<br> of him who hath done so generously by them--and the more that that son<br> is himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this<br> day, or ever shall be.’<br><br> He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,<br> playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and<br> right noisily, too. They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion<br> which in that day prevailed among serving-men and 'prentices{1}--that<br> is to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the<br> size of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such<br> scanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair<br> fell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight<br> around; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely<br> and hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt;<br> bright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large<br> metal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.<br><br> The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with<br> native dignity--<br><br> ‘Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth<br> speech with him.’<br><br> A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--<br><br> ‘Marry, art thou his grace's messenger, beggar?’<br><br> The prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his<br> hip, but there was nothing there. There was a storm of laughter, and<br> one boy said--<br><br> ‘Didst mark that? He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince<br> himself.’<br><br> This sally brought more laughter. Poor Edward drew himself up proudly<br> and said--<br><br> ‘I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my<br> father's bounty to use me so.’<br><br> This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. The youth who had<br> first spoken, shouted to his comrades--<br><br> ‘Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace's princely father, where be<br> your manners? Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to<br> his kingly port and royal rags!’<br><br> With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did<br> mock homage to their prey. The prince spurned the nearest boy with his<br> foot, and said fiercely--<br><br> ‘Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!’<br><br> Ah, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun. The laughter<br> ceased on the instant, and fury took its place. A dozen shouted--<br><br> ‘Hale him forth! To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond! Where be the<br> dogs? Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!’<br><br> Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred<br> person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and<br> set upon and torn by dogs.<br><br> As night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in<br> the close-built portion of the city. His body was bruised, his hands<br> were bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud. He wandered<br> on and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint<br> he could hardly drag one foot after the other. He had ceased to ask<br> questions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of<br> information. He kept muttering to himself, ‘Offal Court--that is the<br> name; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I<br> drop, then am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and<br> prove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have<br> mine own again.’ And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment<br> by those rude Christ's Hospital boys, and he said, ‘When I am king, they<br> shall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books;<br> for a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the<br> heart. I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day's<br> lesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning<br> softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.’ {1}<br><br> The lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a<br> raw and gusty night set in. The houseless prince, the homeless heir to<br> the throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze<br> of squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were<br> massed together.<br><br> Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--<br><br> ‘Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home,<br> I warrant me! If it be so, an' I do not break all the bones in thy lean<br> body, then am I not John Canty, but some other.’<br><br> The prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned<br> shoulder, and eagerly said--<br><br> ‘Oh, art _his_ father, truly? Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt<br> thou fetch him away and restore me!’<br><br> ‘_His_ father? I know not what thou mean'st; I but know I am _thy_<br> father, as thou shalt soon have cause to--’<br><br> ‘Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can<br> bear no more. Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich<br> beyond thy wildest dreams. Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no<br> lie, but only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me! I am indeed<br> the Prince of Wales!’<br><br> The man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and<br> muttered--<br><br> ‘Gone stark mad as any Tom o' Bedlam!’--then collared him once more,<br> and said with a coarse laugh and an oath, ‘But mad or no mad, I and thy<br> Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or<br> I'm no true man!’<br><br> With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and<br> disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of<br> human vermin.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER V. Tom as a Patrician.<br><br> Tom Canty, left alone in the prince's cabinet, made good use of his<br> opportunity. He turned himself this way and that before the great<br> mirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince's<br> high-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass. Next he<br> drew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it<br> across his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to<br> the lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering<br> the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity. Tom<br> played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined<br> the costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the<br> sumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court<br> herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur. He wondered if<br> they would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home,<br> or if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination<br> had at last upset his reason.<br><br> At the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince<br> was gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very<br> soon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the<br> pretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed.<br> Suppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince's clothes, and<br> the prince not there to explain. Might they not hang him at once,<br> and inquire into his case afterward? He had heard that the great<br> were prompt about small matters. His fear rose higher and higher; and<br> trembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to<br> fly and seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release. Six<br> gorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed<br> like butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him. He<br> stepped quickly back and shut the door. He said--<br><br> ‘Oh, they mock at me! They will go and tell. Oh! why came I here to<br> cast away my life?’<br><br> He walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening,<br> starting at every trifling sound. Presently the door swung open, and a<br> silken page said--<br><br> ‘The Lady Jane Grey.’<br><br> The door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him.<br> But she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice--<br><br> ‘Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?’<br><br> Tom's breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out--<br><br> ‘Ah, be merciful, thou! In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty<br> of Offal Court in the city. Prithee let me see the prince, and he will<br> of his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt. Oh, be<br> thou merciful, and save me!’<br><br> By this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes<br> and uplifted hands as well as with his tongue. The young girl seemed<br> horror-stricken. She cried out--<br><br> ‘O my lord, on thy knees?--and to _me_!’<br><br> Then she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down,<br> murmuring--<br><br> ‘There is no help, there is no hope. Now will they come and take me.’<br><br> Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were speeding<br> through the palace. The whisper--for it was whispered always--flew from<br> menial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the long corridors, from<br> story to story, from saloon to saloon, ‘The prince hath gone mad, the<br> prince hath gone mad!’ Soon every saloon, every marble hall, had its<br> groups of glittering lords and ladies, and other groups of dazzling<br> lesser folk, talking earnestly together in whispers, and every face<br> had in it dismay. Presently a splendid official came marching by these<br> groups, making solemn proclamation--<br><br> ‘IN THE NAME OF THE KING!<br><br> Let none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of death, nor<br> discuss the same, nor carry it abroad. In the name of the King!’<br><br> The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been<br> stricken dumb.<br><br> Soon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of ‘The prince! See,<br> the prince comes!’<br><br> Poor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying to<br> bow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with<br> bewildered and pathetic eyes. Great nobles walked upon each side of<br> him, making him lean upon them, and so steady his steps. Behind him<br> followed the court-physicians and some servants.<br><br> Presently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard<br> the door close behind him. Around him stood those who had come with<br> him. Before him, at a little distance, reclined a very large and very<br> fat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern expression. His large<br> head was very grey; and his whiskers, which he wore only around his<br> face, like a frame, were grey also. His clothing was of rich stuff,<br> but old, and slightly frayed in places. One of his swollen legs had a<br> pillow under it, and was wrapped in bandages. There was silence now;<br> and there was no head there but was bent in reverence, except this<br> man's. This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII. He<br> said--and his face grew gentle as he began to speak--<br><br> ‘How now, my lord Edward, my prince? Hast been minded to cozen me, the<br> good King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly useth thee, with a<br> sorry jest?’<br><br> Poor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let him,<br> to the beginning of this speech; but when the words 'me, the good King'<br> fell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as instantly upon<br> his knees as if a shot had brought him there. Lifting up his hands, he<br> exclaimed--<br><br> ‘Thou the _King_? Then am I undone indeed!’<br><br> This speech seemed to stun the King. His eyes wandered from face to<br> face aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy before him. Then<br> he said in a tone of deep disappointment--<br><br> ‘Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth; but I<br> fear me 'tis not so.’ He breathed a heavy sigh, and said in a gentle<br> voice, ‘Come to thy father, child: thou art not well.’<br><br> Tom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of England,<br> humble and trembling. The King took the frightened face between his<br> hands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile, as if seeking<br> some grateful sign of returning reason there, then pressed the curly<br> head against his breast, and patted it tenderly. Presently he said--<br><br> ‘Dost not know thy father, child? Break not mine old heart; say thou<br> know'st me. Thou _dost_ know me, dost thou not?’<br><br> ‘Yea: thou art my dread lord the King, whom God preserve!’<br><br> ‘True, true--that is well--be comforted, tremble not so; there is none<br> here would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou art better<br> now; thy ill dream passeth--is't not so? Thou wilt not miscall thyself<br> again, as they say thou didst a little while agone?’<br><br> ‘I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth, most<br> dread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a pauper<br> born, and 'tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here, albeit I was<br> therein nothing blameful. I am but young to die, and thou canst save me<br> with one little word. Oh speak it, sir!’<br><br> ‘Die? Talk not so, sweet prince--peace, peace, to thy troubled<br> heart--thou shalt not die!’<br><br> Tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry--<br><br> ‘God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless thy<br> land!’ Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the two lords<br> in waiting, and exclaimed, ‘Thou heard'st it! I am not to die: the<br> King hath said it!’ There was no movement, save that all bowed with<br> grave respect; but no one spoke. He hesitated, a little confused, then<br> turned timidly toward the King, saying, ‘I may go now?’<br><br> ‘Go? Surely, if thou desirest. But why not tarry yet a little? Whither<br> would'st go?’<br><br> Tom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly--<br><br> ‘Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I moved<br> to seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery, yet which<br> harboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to me; whereas these<br> pomps and splendours whereunto I am not used--oh, please you, sir, to<br> let me go!’<br><br> The King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face betrayed a<br> growing distress and uneasiness. Presently he said, with something of<br> hope in his voice--<br><br> ‘Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits<br> unmarred as toucheth other matter. God send it may be so! We will make<br> trial.’<br><br> Then he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him lamely in<br> the same tongue. The lords and doctors manifested their gratification<br> also. The King said--<br><br> ‘'Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth that his<br> mind is but diseased, not stricken fatally. How say you, sir?’<br><br> The physician addressed bowed low, and replied--<br><br> ‘It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined<br> aright.’<br><br> The King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it did from<br> so excellent authority, and continued with good heart--<br><br> ‘Now mark ye all: we will try him further.’<br><br> He put a question to Tom in French. Tom stood silent a moment,<br> embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then said<br> diffidently--<br><br> ‘I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your majesty.’<br><br> The King fell back upon his couch. The attendants flew to his<br> assistance; but he put them aside, and said--<br><br> ‘Trouble me not--it is nothing but a scurvy faintness. Raise me! There,<br> 'tis sufficient. Come hither, child; there, rest thy poor troubled head<br> upon thy father's heart, and be at peace. Thou'lt soon be well: 'tis<br> but a passing fantasy. Fear thou not; thou'lt soon be well.’ Then<br> he turned toward the company: his gentle manner changed, and baleful<br> lightnings began to play from his eyes. He said--<br><br> ‘List ye all! This my son is mad; but it is not permanent. Over-study<br> hath done this, and somewhat too much of confinement. Away with his<br> books and teachers! see ye to it. Pleasure him with sports, beguile him<br> in wholesome ways, so that his health come again.’ He raised himself<br> higher still, and went on with energy, ‘He is mad; but he is my son,<br> and England's heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign! And hear ye<br> further, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh<br> against the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows!<br> . . . Give me to drink--I burn: this sorrow sappeth my strength. . . .<br> There, take away the cup. . . . Support me. There, that is well. Mad,<br> is he? Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I<br> the King will confirm it. This very morrow shall he be installed in his<br> princely dignity in due and ancient form. Take instant order for it, my<br> lord Hertford.’<br><br> One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said--<br><br> ‘The King's majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England<br> lieth attainted in the Tower. It were not meet that one attainted--’<br><br> ‘Peace! Insult not mine ears with his hated name. Is this man to<br> live for ever? Am I to be baulked of my will? Is the prince to tarry<br> uninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal<br> free of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours? No, by the<br> splendour of God! Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk's doom before<br> the sun rise again, else shall they answer for it grievously!’ {1}<br><br> Lord Hertford said--<br><br> ‘The King's will is law;’ and, rising, returned to his former place.<br><br> Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King's face, and he said--<br><br> ‘Kiss me, my prince. There . . . what fearest thou? Am I not thy<br> loving father?’<br><br> ‘Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that<br> in truth I know. But--but--it grieveth me to think of him that is to<br> die, and--’<br><br> ‘Ah, 'tis like thee, 'tis like thee! I know thy heart is still the<br> same, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a<br> gentle spirit. But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours:<br> I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great<br> office. Comfort thee, my prince: trouble not thy poor head with this<br> matter.’<br><br> ‘But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege? How long might he not<br> live, but for me?’<br><br> ‘Take no thought of him, my prince: he is not worthy. Kiss me once<br> again, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth<br> me. I am aweary, and would rest. Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy<br> people, and come again when my body is refreshed.’<br><br> Tom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last<br> sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would<br> be set free. Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, ‘The<br> prince, the prince comes!’<br><br> His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering<br> files of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a<br> captive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a<br> forlorn and friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him<br> and set him free.<br><br> And, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the<br> severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the<br> eyes fixed on him reproachfully.<br><br> His old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VI. Tom receives instructions.<br><br> Tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made<br> to sit down--a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly<br> men and men of high degree about him. He begged them to be seated<br> also, but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained<br> standing. He would have insisted, but his 'uncle' the Earl of Hertford<br> whispered in his ear--<br><br> ‘Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy<br> presence.’<br><br> The Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he<br> said--<br><br> ‘I come upon the King's errand, concerning a matter which requireth<br> privacy. Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend<br> you here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?’<br><br> Observing that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford<br> whispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to<br> speak unless he chose. When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St.<br> John said--<br><br> ‘His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the<br> prince's grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his<br> power, till it be passed and he be as he was before. To wit, that he<br> shall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England's<br> greatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive,<br> without word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which<br> unto it do appertain of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to<br> speak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured<br> out of the unwholesome imaginings of o'er-wrought fancy; that he shall<br> strive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which<br> he was wont to know--and where he faileth he shall hold his peace,<br> neither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath<br> forgot; that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall<br> perplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should<br> make, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on, but<br> take advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my humble self,<br> which are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at<br> call, till this commandment be dissolved. Thus saith the King's majesty,<br> who sendeth greeting to your royal highness, and prayeth that God will<br> of His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy<br> keeping.’<br><br> The Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside. Tom replied<br> resignedly--<br><br> ‘The King hath said it. None may palter with the King's command, or fit<br> it to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions. The King shall<br> be obeyed.’<br><br> Lord Hertford said--<br><br> ‘Touching the King's majesty's ordainment concerning books and such like<br> serious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your<br> time with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet<br> and suffer harm thereby.’<br><br> Tom's face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw<br> Lord St. John's eyes bent sorrowfully upon him. His lordship said--<br><br> ‘Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise--but<br> suffer it not to trouble thee, for 'tis a matter that will not bide,<br> but depart with thy mending malady. My Lord of Hertford speaketh of<br> the city's banquet which the King's majesty did promise, some two months<br> flown, your highness should attend. Thou recallest it now?’<br><br> ‘It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me,’ said Tom, in a<br> hesitating voice; and blushed again.<br><br> At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced.<br> The two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped<br> quickly toward the door. As the young girls passed him, he said in a<br> low voice--<br><br> ‘I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise<br> when his memory doth lapse--it will grieve you to note how it doth stick<br> at every trifle.’<br><br> Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom's ear--<br><br> ‘Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty's desire. Remember<br> all thou canst--_seem_ to remember all else. Let them not perceive that<br> thou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy<br> old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how 'twould grieve them.<br> Art willing, sir, that I remain?--and thine uncle?’<br><br> Tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was<br> already learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself<br> as best he might, according to the King's command.<br><br> In spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people<br> became a little embarrassing at times. More than once, in truth,<br> Tom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his<br> tremendous part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a<br> word from one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently<br> by chance, had the same happy effect. Once the little Lady Jane turned<br> to Tom and dismayed him with this question,--<br><br> ‘Hast paid thy duty to the Queen's majesty to-day, my lord?’<br><br> Tom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something<br> at hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him<br> with the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate<br> difficulties and to be ready for them--<br><br> ‘He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his<br> majesty's condition; is it not so, your highness?’<br><br> Tom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was<br> getting upon dangerous ground. Somewhat later it was mentioned that<br> Tom was to study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship<br> exclaimed--<br><br> ‘'Tis a pity, 'tis a pity! Thou wert proceeding bravely. But bide thy<br> time in patience: it will not be for long. Thou'lt yet be graced<br> with learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many<br> languages as his, good my prince.’<br><br> ‘My father!’ cried Tom, off his guard for the moment. ‘I trow he cannot<br> speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may<br> tell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever--’<br><br> He looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John's<br> eyes.<br><br> He stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: ‘Ah, my malady<br> persecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth. I meant the King's grace<br> no irreverence.’<br><br> ‘We know it, sir,’ said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her 'brother's'<br> hand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; ‘trouble not<br> thyself as to that. The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper's.’<br><br> ‘Thou'rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady,’ said Tom, gratefully, ‘and my<br> heart moveth me to thank thee for't, an' I may be so bold.’<br><br> Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom.<br> The Princess Elizabeth's quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the<br> target's front that the shaft was overshot; so she tranquilly delivered<br> a return volley of sounding Greek on Tom's behalf, and then straightway<br> changed the talk to other matters.<br><br> Time wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole. Snags and<br> sandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more and more at<br> his ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and<br> overlooking his mistakes. When it came out that the little ladies were<br> to accompany him to the Lord Mayor's banquet in the evening, his heart<br> gave a bound of relief and delight, for he felt that he should not be<br> friendless, now, among that multitude of strangers; whereas, an<br> hour earlier, the idea of their going with him would have been an<br> insupportable terror to him.<br><br> Tom's guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in the<br> interview than the other parties to it. They felt much as if they were<br> piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel; they were on the<br> alert constantly, and found their office no child's play. Wherefore,<br> at last, when the ladies' visit was drawing to a close and the Lord<br> Guilford Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had<br> been sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves<br> were not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their<br> anxious voyage all over again. So they respectfully advised Tom to<br> excuse himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade<br> of disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane's face when<br> she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.<br><br> There was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not<br> understand. He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a sign--but he<br> failed to understand that also. The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue<br> with her usual easy grace. She made reverence and said--<br><br> ‘Have we leave of the prince's grace my brother to go?’<br><br> Tom said--<br><br> ‘Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for the<br> asking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor<br> power lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence<br> hence. Give ye good den, and God be with ye!’ Then he smiled inwardly<br> at the thought, ‘'Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in<br> my reading, and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered<br> and gracious speech withal!’<br><br> When the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to his<br> keepers and said--<br><br> ‘May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner<br> and rest me?’<br><br> Lord Hertford said--<br><br> ‘So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us to<br> obey. That thou should'st rest is indeed a needful thing, since thou<br> must journey to the city presently.’<br><br> He touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to desire the<br> presence of Sir William Herbert. This gentleman came straightway, and<br> conducted Tom to an inner apartment. Tom's first movement there was<br> to reach for a cup of water; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it,<br> dropped upon one knee, and offered it to him on a golden salver.<br><br> Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins,<br> timidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet<br> discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him. He<br> made two or three further efforts to help himself, but being promptly<br> forestalled each time, he finally gave up, with a sigh of resignation<br> and a murmured ‘Beshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe<br> for me also!’ Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid<br> himself down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too<br> full of thoughts and the room too full of people. He could not dismiss<br> the former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the<br> latter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret--and theirs.<br><br> Tom's departure had left his two noble guardians alone. They mused a<br> while, with much head-shaking and walking the floor, then Lord St. John<br> said--<br><br> ‘Plainly, what dost thou think?’<br><br> ‘Plainly, then, this. The King is near his end; my nephew is mad--mad<br> will mount the throne, and mad remain. God protect England, since she<br> will need it!’<br><br> ‘Verily it promiseth so, indeed. But . . . have you no misgivings as to<br> . . . as to . . .’<br><br> The speaker hesitated, and finally stopped. He evidently felt that he<br> was upon delicate ground. Lord Hertford stopped before him, looked into<br> his face with a clear, frank eye, and said--<br><br> ‘Speak on--there is none to hear but me. Misgivings as to what?’<br><br> ‘I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou so near<br> to him in blood, my lord. But craving pardon if I do offend, seemeth it<br> not strange that madness could so change his port and manner?--not but<br> that his port and speech are princely still, but that they _differ_,<br> in one unweighty trifle or another, from what his custom was aforetime.<br> Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his<br> father's very lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due<br> from such as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his<br> Greek and French? My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its<br> disquiet and receive my grateful thanks. It haunteth me, his saying he<br> was not the prince, and so--’<br><br> ‘Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason! Hast forgot the King's command?<br> Remember I am party to thy crime if I but listen.’<br><br> St. John paled, and hastened to say--<br><br> ‘I was in fault, I do confess it. Betray me not, grant me this grace<br> out of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak of this thing<br> more. Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I ruined.’<br><br> ‘I am content, my lord. So thou offend not again, here or in the<br> ears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken. But thou<br> need'st not have misgivings. He is my sister's son; are not his voice,<br> his face, his form, familiar to me from his cradle? Madness can do all<br> the odd conflicting things thou seest in him, and more. Dost not recall<br> how that the old Baron Marley, being mad, forgot the favour of his<br> own countenance that he had known for sixty years, and held it was<br> another's; nay, even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that<br> his head was made of Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none<br> to touch it, lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it? Give<br> thy misgivings easement, good my lord. This is the very prince--I know<br> him well--and soon will be thy king; it may advantage thee to bear this<br> in mind, and more dwell upon it than the other.’<br><br> After some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up his<br> mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was<br> thoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts again, the<br> Lord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down to keep watch and<br> ward alone. He was soon deep in meditation, and evidently the longer he<br> thought, the more he was bothered. By-and-by he began to pace the floor<br> and mutter.<br><br> ‘Tush, he _must_ be the prince! Will any be in all the land maintain<br> there can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?<br> And even were it so, 'twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should<br> cast the one into the other's place. Nay, 'tis folly, folly, folly!’<br><br> Presently he said--<br><br> ‘Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you _that_ would<br> be natural; that would be reasonable. But lived ever an impostor yet,<br> who, being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by<br> all, _denied_ his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation? _No_! By<br> the soul of St. Swithin, no! This is the true prince, gone mad!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VII. Tom's first royal dinner.<br><br> Somewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal<br> of being dressed for dinner. He found himself as finely clothed as<br> before, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff to<br> his stockings. He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious<br> and ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one. Its<br> furniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which<br> well-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. The<br> room was half-filled with noble servitors. A chaplain said grace, and<br> Tom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with<br> him, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a<br> napkin about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince<br> of Wales was hereditary in this nobleman's family. Tom's cupbearer was<br> present, and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. The<br> Taster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to<br> taste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being<br> poisoned. He was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was<br> seldom called upon to exercise his function; but there had been times,<br> not many generations past, when the office of taster had its perils,<br> and was not a grandeur to be desired. Why they did not use a dog or a<br> plumber seems strange; but all the ways of royalty are strange. My<br> Lord d'Arcy, First Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows<br> what; but there he was--let that suffice. The Lord Chief Butler was<br> there, and stood behind Tom's chair, overseeing the solemnities, under<br> command of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who stood<br> near. Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these;<br> but they were not all in that room, of course, nor the quarter of them;<br> neither was Tom aware yet that they existed.<br><br> All those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to<br> remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be<br> careful to show no surprise at his vagaries. These 'vagaries' were<br> soon on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and<br> their sorrow, not their mirth. It was a heavy affliction to them to see<br> the beloved prince so stricken.<br><br> Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or even<br> seemed to observe it. He inspected his napkin curiously, and with deep<br> interest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then said<br> with simplicity--<br><br> ‘Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled.’<br><br> The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and without<br> word or protest of any sort.<br><br> Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked what<br> they were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently that<br> men had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing<br> them as luxuries from Holland. {1} His question was answered with grave<br> respect, and no surprise manifested. When he had finished his dessert,<br> he filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be aware of it,<br> or disturbed by it. But the next moment he was himself disturbed by<br> it, and showed discomposure; for this was the only service he had been<br> permitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he did not doubt<br> that he had done a most improper and unprincely thing. At that moment<br> the muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to<br> lift and wrinkle. This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing<br> distress. He looked appealingly, first at one and then another of the<br> lords about him, and tears came into his eyes. They sprang forward with<br> dismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble. Tom said with<br> genuine anguish--<br><br> ‘I crave your indulgence: my nose itcheth cruelly. What is the custom<br> and usage in this emergence? Prithee, speed, for 'tis but a little time<br> that I can bear it.’<br><br> None smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other<br> in deep tribulation for counsel. But behold, here was a dead wall, and<br> nothing in English history to tell how to get over it. The Master of<br> Ceremonies was not present: there was no one who felt safe to venture<br> upon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn<br> problem. Alas! there was no Hereditary Scratcher. Meantime the tears<br> had overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom's cheeks. His<br> twitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. At last<br> nature broke down the barriers of etiquette: Tom lifted up an inward<br> prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the<br> burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.<br><br> His meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad, shallow,<br> golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth and<br> fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin<br> for his use. Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised<br> it to his lips, and gravely took a draught. Then he returned it to the<br> waiting lord, and said--<br><br> ‘Nay, it likes me not, my lord: it hath a pretty flavour, but it<br> wanteth strength.’<br><br> This new eccentricity of the prince's ruined mind made all the hearts<br> about him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment.<br><br> Tom's next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table<br> just when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with<br> uplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning<br> the blessing. Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done<br> a thing unusual.<br><br> By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private<br> cabinet, and left there alone to his own devices. Hanging upon hooks in<br> the oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel<br> armour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid<br> in gold. This martial panoply belonged to the true prince--a recent<br> present from Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the<br> gauntlets, the plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don<br> without assistance, and for a while was minded to call for help and<br> complete the matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away<br> from dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye<br> him, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services;<br> so he restored the pretty things to their several places, and soon was<br> cracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time<br> since God for his sins had made him a prince. When the nuts were all<br> gone, he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet, among them one<br> about the etiquette of the English court. This was a prize. He lay down<br> upon a sumptuous divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest<br> zeal. Let us leave him there for the present.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VIII. The Question of the Seal.<br><br> About five o'clock Henry VIII. awoke out of an unrefreshing nap, and<br> muttered to himself, ‘Troublous dreams, troublous dreams! Mine end is<br> now at hand: so say these warnings, and my failing pulses do confirm<br> it.’ Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye, and he muttered,<br> ‘Yet will not I die till _He_ go before.’<br><br> His attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked his<br> pleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without.<br><br> ‘Admit him, admit him!’ exclaimed the King eagerly.<br><br> The Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King's couch, saying--<br><br> ‘I have given order, and, according to the King's command, the peers of<br> the realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of the House, where,<br> having confirmed the Duke of Norfolk's doom, they humbly wait his<br> majesty's further pleasure in the matter.’<br><br> The King's face lit up with a fierce joy. Said he--<br><br> ‘Lift me up! In mine own person will I go before my Parliament, and<br> with mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of--’<br><br> His voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks; and<br> the attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedly assisted<br> him with restoratives. Presently he said sorrowfully--<br><br> ‘Alack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it<br> cometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance. But speed ye, speed<br> ye! let others do this happy office sith 'tis denied to me. I put my<br> Great Seal in commission: choose thou the lords that shall compose it,<br> and get ye to your work. Speed ye, man! Before the sun shall rise and<br> set again, bring me his head that I may see it.’<br><br> ‘According to the King's command, so shall it be. Will't please your<br> majesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so that I may<br> forth upon the business?’<br><br> ‘The Seal? Who keepeth the Seal but thou?’<br><br> ‘Please your majesty, you did take it from me two days since, saying it<br> should no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon<br> the Duke of Norfolk's warrant.’<br><br> ‘Why, so in sooth I did: I do remember. . . . What did I with it?...<br> I am very feeble. . . . So oft these days doth my memory play the<br> traitor with me. . . . 'Tis strange, strange--’<br><br> The King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his grey head<br> weakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollect what he<br> had done with the Seal. At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and<br> offer information--<br><br> ‘Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do remember with<br> me how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the<br> Prince of Wales to keep against the day that--’<br><br> ‘True, most true!’ interrupted the King. ‘Fetch it! Go: time flieth!’<br><br> Lord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before very long,<br> troubled and empty-handed. He delivered himself to this effect--<br><br> ‘It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcome<br> tidings; but it is the will of God that the prince's affliction abideth<br> still, and he cannot recall to mind that he received the Seal. So came<br> I quickly to report, thinking it were waste of precious time, and<br> little worth withal, that any should attempt to search the long array of<br> chambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high--’<br><br> A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point. After a<br> little while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone--<br><br> ‘Trouble him no more, poor child. The hand of God lieth heavy upon him,<br> and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I<br> may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so<br> bring him peace.’<br><br> He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After<br> a time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his<br> glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face<br> flushed with wrath--<br><br> ‘What, thou here yet! By the glory of God, an' thou gettest not about<br> that traitor's business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for<br> lack of a head to grace withal!’<br><br> The trembling Chancellor answered--<br><br> ‘Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! I but waited for the Seal.’<br><br> ‘Man, hast lost thy wits? The small Seal which aforetime I was wont<br> to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. And, since the Great Seal<br> hath flown away, shall not it suffice? Hast lost thy wits? Begone!<br> And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring his head.’<br><br> The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous<br> vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent<br> to the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the<br> beheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER IX. The river pageant.<br><br> At nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was<br> blazing with light. The river itself, as far as the eye could reach<br> citywards, was so thickly covered with watermen's boats and with<br> pleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated<br> by the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of<br> flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds. The grand terrace of<br> stone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army<br> of a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks<br> of royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly<br> costumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of<br> preparation.<br><br> Presently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures<br> vanished from the steps. Now the air was heavy with the hush of<br> suspense and expectancy. As far as one's vision could carry, he might<br> see the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes<br> from the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace.<br><br> A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps. They were<br> richly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.<br> Some of them were decorated with banners and streamers; some with<br> cloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms; others with<br> silken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them,<br> which shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes<br> fluttered them; others of yet higher pretensions, since they belonged to<br> nobles in the prince's immediate service, had their sides picturesquely<br> fenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings. Each<br> state barge was towed by a tender. Besides the rowers, these tenders<br> carried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate,<br> and a company of musicians.<br><br> The advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great<br> gateway, a troop of halberdiers. 'They were dressed in striped hose of<br> black and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses, and<br> doublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on the front and back<br> with the three feathers, the prince's blazon, woven in gold. Their<br> halberd staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt<br> nails, and ornamented with gold tassels. Filing off on the right and<br> left, they formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the<br> palace to the water's edge. A thick rayed cloth or carpet was<br> then unfolded, and laid down between them by attendants in the<br> gold-and-crimson liveries of the prince. This done, a flourish of<br> trumpets resounded from within. A lively prelude arose from the<br> musicians on the water; and two ushers with white wands marched with a<br> slow and stately pace from the portal. They were followed by an officer<br> bearing the civic mace, after whom came another carrying the city's<br> sword; then several sergeants of the city guard, in their full<br> accoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; then the Garter<br> King-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights of the Bath, each with<br> a white lace on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in<br> their robes of scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High Chancellor of<br> England, in a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled with minever;<br> then a deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the<br> heads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state. Now<br> came twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of<br> pourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of<br> crimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured<br> hauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps. They were of the<br> suite of the French ambassador, and were followed by twelve cavaliers of<br> the suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in black velvet, unrelieved<br> by any ornament. Following these came several great English nobles with<br> their attendants.'<br><br> There was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince's uncle, the<br> future great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway, arrayed in a<br> 'doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered<br> with gold, and ribanded with nets of silver.' He turned, doffed<br> his plumed cap, bent his body in a low reverence, and began to step<br> backward, bowing at each step. A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and<br> a proclamation, ‘Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of<br> Wales!’ High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of<br> flame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river<br> burst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero<br> of it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head.<br><br> He was 'magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a<br> front-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged<br> with ermine. Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced<br> with the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls<br> and precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants. About his<br> neck hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;'<br> and wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash.<br> O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar<br> with rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER X. The Prince in the toils.<br><br> We left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with<br> a noisy and delighted mob at his heels. There was but one person in it<br> who offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he<br> was hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil. The Prince continued<br> to struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was<br> suffering, until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him,<br> and raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince's head.<br> The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man's arm, and the<br> blow descended upon his own wrist. Canty roared out--<br><br> ‘Thou'lt meddle, wilt thou? Then have thy reward.’<br><br> His cudgel crashed down upon the meddler's head: there was a groan, a<br> dim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next<br> moment it lay there in the dark alone. The mob pressed on, their<br> enjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.<br><br> Presently the Prince found himself in John Canty's abode, with the door<br> closed against the outsiders. By the vague light of a tallow candle<br> which was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the<br> loathsome den, and also the occupants of it. Two frowsy girls and<br> a middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the<br> aspect of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading<br> it now. From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey<br> hair and malignant eyes. John Canty said to this one--<br><br> ‘Tarry! There's fine mummeries here. Mar them not till thou'st enjoyed<br> them: then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt. Stand forth, lad. Now<br> say thy foolery again, an thou'st not forgot it. Name thy name. Who art<br> thou?’<br><br> The insulted blood mounted to the little prince's cheek once more, and<br> he lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man's face and said--<br><br> ‘'Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak. I tell<br> thee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none<br> other.’<br><br> The stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag's feet to the floor<br> where she stood, and almost took her breath. She stared at the Prince<br> in stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst<br> into a roar of laughter. But the effect upon Tom Canty's mother and<br> sisters was different. Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to<br> distress of a different sort. They ran forward with woe and dismay in<br> their faces, exclaiming--<br><br> ‘Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!’<br><br> The mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his<br> shoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears.<br> Then she said--<br><br> ‘Oh, my poor boy! Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at<br> last, and ta'en thy wit away. Ah! why did'st thou cleave to it when I<br> so warned thee 'gainst it? Thou'st broke thy mother's heart.’<br><br> The Prince looked into her face, and said gently--<br><br> ‘Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame. Comfort thee:<br> let me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my<br> father restore him to thee.’<br><br> ‘The King thy father! Oh, my child! unsay these words that be freighted<br> with death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee. Shake of<br> this gruesome dream. Call back thy poor wandering memory. Look upon<br> me. Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?’<br><br> The Prince shook his head and reluctantly said--<br><br> ‘God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never<br> looked upon thy face before.’<br><br> The woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her<br> eyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.<br><br> ‘Let the show go on!’ shouted Canty. ‘What, Nan!--what, Bet! mannerless<br> wenches! will ye stand in the Prince's presence? Upon your knees, ye<br> pauper scum, and do him reverence!’<br><br> He followed this with another horse-laugh. The girls began to plead<br> timidly for their brother; and Nan said--<br><br> ‘An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his<br> madness: prithee, do.’<br><br> ‘Do, father,’ said Bet; ‘he is more worn than is his wont. To-morrow<br> will he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not<br> empty home again.’<br><br> This remark sobered the father's joviality, and brought his mind to<br> business. He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said--<br><br> ‘The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two<br> pennies, mark ye--all this money for a half-year's rent, else out of<br> this we go. Show what thou'st gathered with thy lazy begging.’<br><br> The Prince said--<br><br> ‘Offend me not with thy sordid matters. I tell thee again I am the<br> King's son.’<br><br> A sounding blow upon the Prince's shoulder from Canty's broad palm<br> sent him staggering into goodwife Canty's arms, who clasped him to her<br> breast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by<br> interposing her own person. The frightened girls retreated to their<br> corner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son.<br> The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming--<br><br> ‘Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam. Let these swine do their will<br> upon me alone.’<br><br> This speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about<br> their work without waste of time. Between them they belaboured the boy<br> right soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for<br> showing sympathy for the victim.<br><br> ‘Now,’ said Canty, ‘to bed, all of ye. The entertainment has tired me.’<br><br> The light was put out, and the family retired. As soon as the snorings<br> of the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep,<br> the young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly<br> from the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also,<br> and stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of<br> comfort and compassion in his ear the while. She had saved a morsel for<br> him to eat, also; but the boy's pains had swept away all appetite--at<br> least for black and tasteless crusts. He was touched by her brave and<br> costly defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in<br> very noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try<br> to forget her sorrows. And he added that the King his father would not<br> let her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded. This return to his<br> 'madness' broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again<br> and again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed.<br><br> As she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into<br> her mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was<br> lacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane. She could not describe it, she could<br> not tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to<br> detect it and perceive it. What if the boy were really not her son,<br> after all? Oh, absurd! She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her<br> griefs and troubles. No matter, she found that it was an idea that<br> would not 'down,' but persisted in haunting her. It pursued her, it<br> harassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored.<br> At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her<br> until she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without<br> question, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these<br> wearing and worrying doubts. Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way<br> out of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to<br> contrive that test. But it was an easier thing to propose than to<br> accomplish. She turned over in her mind one promising test after<br> another, but was obliged to relinquish them all--none of them were<br> absolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not<br> satisfy her. Evidently she was racking her head in vain--it seemed<br> manifest that she must give the matter up. While this depressing<br> thought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular<br> breathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep. And while she<br> listened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled<br> cry, such as one utters in a troubled dream. This chance occurrence<br> furnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests<br> combined. She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work<br> to relight her candle, muttering to herself, ‘Had I but seen him _then_,<br> I should have known! Since that day, when he was little, that the<br> powder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of<br> his dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his<br> eyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the<br> palm inward, but always with the palm turned outward--I have seen it a<br> hundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed. Yes, I shall<br> soon know, now!’<br><br> By this time she had crept to the slumbering boy's side, with the<br> candle, shaded, in her hand. She bent heedfully and warily over him,<br> scarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement, and suddenly flashed<br> the light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles.<br> The sleeper's eyes sprang wide open, and he cast a startled stare about<br> him--but he made no special movement with his hands.<br><br> The poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief;<br> but she contrived to hide her emotions, and to soothe the boy to sleep<br> again; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon<br> the disastrous result of her experiment. She tried to believe that her<br> Tom's madness had banished this habitual gesture of his; but she could<br> not do it. ‘No,’ she said, ‘his _hands_ are not mad; they could not<br> unlearn so old a habit in so brief a time. Oh, this is a heavy day for<br> me!’<br><br> Still, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she could not<br> bring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must try the thing<br> again--the failure must have been only an accident; so she startled the<br> boy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at intervals--with the<br> same result which had marked the first test; then she dragged herself to<br> bed, and fell sorrowfully asleep, saying, ‘But I cannot give him up--oh<br> no, I cannot, I cannot--he _must_ be my boy!’<br><br> The poor mother's interruptions having ceased, and the Prince's pains<br> having gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter weariness at<br> last sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep. Hour after hour<br> slipped away, and still he slept like the dead. Thus four or five hours<br> passed. Then his stupor began to lighten. Presently, while half asleep<br> and half awake, he murmured--<br><br> ‘Sir William!’<br><br> After a moment--<br><br> ‘Ho, Sir William Herbert! Hie thee hither, and list to the strangest<br> dream that ever . . . Sir William! dost hear? Man, I did think me<br> changed to a pauper, and . . . Ho there! Guards! Sir William! What!<br> is there no groom of the chamber in waiting? Alack! it shall go hard<br> with--’<br><br> ‘What aileth thee?’ asked a whisper near him. ‘Who art thou calling?’<br><br> ‘Sir William Herbert. Who art thou?’<br><br> ‘I? Who should I be, but thy sister Nan? Oh, Tom, I had forgot!<br> Thou'rt mad yet--poor lad, thou'rt mad yet: would I had never woke to<br> know it again! But prithee master thy tongue, lest we be all beaten<br> till we die!’<br><br> The startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from his<br> stiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back among his<br> foul straw with a moan and the ejaculation--<br><br> ‘Alas! it was no dream, then!’<br><br> In a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished<br> were upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer a petted<br> prince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him, but<br> a pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den fit only for<br> beasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves.<br><br> In the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises<br> and shoutings, apparently but a block or two away. The next moment<br> there were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty ceased from<br> snoring and said--<br><br> ‘Who knocketh? What wilt thou?’<br><br> A voice answered--<br><br> ‘Know'st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?’<br><br> ‘No. Neither know I, nor care.’<br><br> ‘Belike thou'lt change thy note eftsoons. An thou would save thy neck,<br> nothing but flight may stead thee. The man is this moment delivering up<br> the ghost. 'Tis the priest, Father Andrew!’<br><br> ‘God-a-mercy!’ exclaimed Canty. He roused his family, and hoarsely<br> commanded, ‘Up with ye all and fly--or bide where ye are and perish!’<br><br> Scarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and<br> flying for their lives. John Canty held the Prince by the wrist, and<br> hurried him along the dark way, giving him this caution in a low voice--<br><br> ‘Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name. I will choose<br> me a new name, speedily, to throw the law's dogs off the scent. Mind<br> thy tongue, I tell thee!’<br><br> He growled these words to the rest of the family--<br><br> ‘If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge;<br> whoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper's shop on the<br> bridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee<br> into Southwark together.’<br><br> At this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light;<br> and not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing,<br> dancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage.<br> There was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up<br> and down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge<br> likewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of<br> coloured lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies<br> with an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain<br> of dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were<br> crowds of revellers; all London seemed to be at large.<br><br> John Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat;<br> but it was too late. He and his tribe were swallowed up in that<br> swarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in<br> an instant. We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe;<br> Canty still kept his grip upon him. The Prince's heart was beating high<br> with hopes of escape, now. A burly waterman, considerably exalted with<br> liquor, found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough<br> through the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty's shoulder and said--<br><br> ‘Nay, whither so fast, friend? Dost canker thy soul with sordid<br> business when all that be leal men and true make holiday?’<br><br> ‘Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not,’ answered Canty,<br> roughly; ‘take away thy hand and let me pass.’<br><br> ‘Sith that is thy humour, thou'lt _not_ pass, till thou'st drunk to the<br> Prince of Wales, I tell thee that,’ said the waterman, barring the way<br> resolutely.<br><br> ‘Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!’<br><br> Other revellers were interested by this time. They cried out--<br><br> ‘The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the<br> loving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes.’<br><br> So a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of<br> its handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary<br> napkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp<br> the opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the<br> other, according to ancient custom. This left the Prince hand-free for<br> a second, of course. He wasted no time, but dived among the forest of<br> legs about him and disappeared. In another moment he could not have<br> been harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had<br> been the Atlantic's and he a lost sixpence.<br><br> He very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about<br> his own affairs without further thought of John Canty. He quickly<br> realised another thing, too. To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales<br> was being feasted by the city in his stead. He easily concluded that<br> the pauper lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his<br> stupendous opportunity and become a usurper.<br><br> Therefore there was but one course to pursue--find his way to the<br> Guildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. He also made<br> up his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual<br> preparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the<br> law and usage of the day in cases of high treason.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XI. At Guildhall.<br><br> The royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way<br> down the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats. The air was<br> laden with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the<br> distant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible<br> bonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted<br> with sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like<br> jewelled lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted<br> from the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless<br> flash and boom of artillery.<br><br> To Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this<br> spectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing. To his<br> little friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane<br> Grey, they were nothing.<br><br> Arrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook<br> (whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under<br> acres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges<br> populous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to<br> a halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient<br> city of London. Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession<br> crossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and<br> Basinghall Street to the Guildhall.<br><br> Tom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord<br> Mayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet<br> robes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of<br> the great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace<br> and the City Sword. The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom<br> and his two small friends took their places behind their chairs.<br><br> At a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree<br> were seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at<br> a multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall. From their lofty<br> vantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the<br> city, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar<br> to it in forgotten generations. There was a bugle-blast and a<br> proclamation, and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward<br> wall, followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a<br> royal baron of beef, smoking hot and ready for the knife.<br><br> After grace, Tom (being instructed) rose--and the whole house with<br> him--and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess<br> Elizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the<br> general assemblage. So the banquet began.<br><br> By midnight the revelry was at its height. Now came one of those<br> picturesque spectacles so admired in that old day. A description of it<br> is still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:<br><br> 'Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after<br> the Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on<br> their heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two<br> swords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold. Next came<br> yet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin,<br> traversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of<br> crimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on<br> their heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots<br> with pykes' (points a foot long), 'turned up. And after them came<br> a knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in<br> doublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the<br> cannell-bone, laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over<br> that, short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after<br> the dancers' fashion, with pheasants' feathers in them. These were<br> appareled after the fashion of Prussia. The torchbearers, which were<br> about an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors,<br> their faces black. Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which<br> were disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also,<br> that it was a pleasure to behold.'<br><br> And while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this 'wild' dancing,<br> lost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours<br> which the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the<br> ragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and<br> his wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at<br> the gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously,<br> and pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter.<br> Presently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him<br> into a higher and still more entertaining fury. Tears of mortification<br> sprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right<br> royally. Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he<br> exclaimed--<br><br> ‘I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales!<br> And all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of<br> grace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground,<br> but will maintain it!’<br><br> ‘Though thou be prince or no prince, 'tis all one, thou be'st a gallant<br> lad, and not friendless neither! Here stand I by thy side to prove<br> it; and mind I tell thee thou might'st have a worser friend than Miles<br> Hendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. Rest thy small jaw, my<br> child; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very<br> native.’<br><br> The speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and<br> bearing. He was tall, trim-built, muscular. His doublet and trunks<br> were of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace<br> adornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged;<br> the plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and<br> disreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron<br> sheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of<br> the camp. The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an<br> explosion of jeers and laughter. Some cried, ‘'Tis another prince in<br> disguise!’ ‘'Ware thy tongue, friend: belike he is dangerous!’<br> ‘Marry, he looketh it--mark his eye!’ ‘Pluck the lad from him--to the<br> horse-pond wi' the cub!’<br><br> Instantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this<br> happy thought; as instantly the stranger's long sword was out and the<br> meddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it.<br> The next moment a score of voices shouted, ‘Kill the dog! Kill him!<br> Kill him!’ and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself<br> against a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a<br> madman. His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured<br> over their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with<br> undiminished fury.<br><br> His moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a<br> trumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, ‘Way for the King's messenger!’<br> and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of<br> harm's reach as fast as their legs could carry them. The bold stranger<br> caught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and<br> the multitude.<br><br> Return we within the Guildhall. Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar<br> and thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a bugle-note. There<br> was instant silence--a deep hush; then a single voice rose--that of the<br> messenger from the palace--and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the<br> whole multitude standing listening.<br><br> The closing words, solemnly pronounced, were--<br><br> ‘The King is dead!’<br><br> The great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one<br> accord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank<br> upon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a<br> mighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building--<br><br> ‘Long live the King!’<br><br> Poor Tom's dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle,<br> and finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a<br> moment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden purpose dawned in his<br> face. He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford's ear--<br><br> ‘Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour! Uttered I here a command,<br> the which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter,<br> would such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?’<br><br> ‘None, my liege, in all these realms. In thy person bides the majesty<br> of England. Thou art the king--thy word is law.’<br><br> Tom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation--<br><br> ‘Then shall the king's law be law of mercy, from this day, and never<br> more be law of blood! Up from thy knees and away! To the Tower, and<br> say the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!’<br><br> The words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and<br> wide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another<br> prodigious shout burst forth--<br><br> ‘The reign of blood is ended! Long live Edward, King of England!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XII. The Prince and his Deliverer.<br><br> As soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob,<br> they struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river. Their<br> way was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they<br> ploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon<br> the Prince's--no, the King's--wrist. The tremendous news was already<br> abroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once--’The King<br> is dead!’ The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little<br> waif, and sent a shudder through his frame. He realised the greatness<br> of his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who<br> had been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him. The<br> tears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects. For an instant<br> he felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God's<br> creatures--then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching<br> thunders: ‘Long live King Edward the Sixth!’ and this made his eyes<br> kindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers' ends. ‘Ah,’ he<br> thought, ‘how grand and strange it seems--_I am King_!’<br><br> Our friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the<br> bridge. This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and<br> had been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious<br> affair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family<br> quarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of<br> the river to the other. The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it<br> had its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food<br> markets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church. It<br> looked upon the two neighbours which it linked together--London<br> and Southwark--as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise<br> particularly important. It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was<br> a narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its<br> population was but a village population and everybody in it knew all<br> his fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers<br> before them--and all their little family affairs into the bargain. It<br> had its aristocracy, of course--its fine old families of butchers, and<br> bakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five<br> or six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from<br> beginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked<br> bridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level,<br> direct, substantial bridgy way. It was just the sort of population to<br> be narrow and ignorant and self-conceited. Children were born on the<br> Bridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without<br> ever having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge<br> alone. Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and<br> interminable procession which moved through its street night and day,<br> with its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing<br> and bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in<br> this world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it. And so they<br> were, in effect--at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and<br> did--for a consideration--whenever a returning king or hero gave it a<br> fleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long,<br> straight, uninterrupted view of marching columns.<br><br> Men born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and<br> inane elsewhere. History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at<br> the age of seventy-one and retired to the country. But he could only<br> fret and toss in his bed; he could not go to sleep, the deep stillness<br> was so painful, so awful, so oppressive. When he was worn out with it,<br> at last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and<br> fell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of<br> the lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge.<br><br> In the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished 'object<br> lessons' in English history for its children--namely, the livid and<br> decaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its<br> gateways. But we digress.<br><br> Hendon's lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge. As he neared<br> the door with his small friend, a rough voice said--<br><br> ‘So, thou'rt come at last! Thou'lt not escape again, I warrant thee;<br> and if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thou'lt<br> not keep us waiting another time, mayhap,’--and John Canty put out his<br> hand to seize the boy.<br><br> Miles Hendon stepped in the way and said--<br><br> ‘Not too fast, friend. Thou art needlessly rough, methinks. What is<br> the lad to thee?’<br><br> ‘If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others' affairs,<br> he is my son.’<br><br> ‘'Tis a lie!’ cried the little King, hotly.<br><br> ‘Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be sound<br> or cracked, my boy. But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father<br> or no, 'tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse,<br> according to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with me.’<br><br> ‘I do, I do--I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I will go<br> with him.’<br><br> ‘Then 'tis settled, and there is nought more to say.’<br><br> ‘We will see, as to that!’ exclaimed John Canty, striding past Hendon to<br> get at the boy; ‘by force shall he--’<br><br> ‘If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, I will spit thee like a<br> goose!’ said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword<br> hilt. Canty drew back. ‘Now mark ye,’ continued Hendon, ‘I took this<br> lad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled<br> him, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser<br> fate?--for whether thou art his father or no--and sooth to say, I think<br> it is a lie--a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life<br> in such brute hands as thine. So go thy ways, and set quick about it,<br> for I like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my<br> nature.’<br><br> John Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was swallowed<br> from sight in the crowd. Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his<br> room, with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent thither. It<br> was a poor apartment, with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old<br> furniture in it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles.<br> The little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost<br> exhausted with hunger and fatigue. He had been on his feet a good<br> part of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o'clock in the<br> morning), and had eaten nothing meantime. He murmured drowsily--<br><br> ‘Prithee call me when the table is spread,’ and sank into a deep sleep<br> immediately.<br><br> A smile twinkled in Hendon's eye, and he said to himself--<br><br> ‘By the mass, the little beggar takes to one's quarters and usurps one's<br> bed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them--with never<br> a by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of the sort. In his<br> diseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth<br> he keep up the character. Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his<br> mind has been disordered with ill-usage. Well, I will be his friend;<br> I have saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the<br> bold-tongued little rascal. How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble<br> and flung back his high defiance! And what a comely, sweet and gentle<br> face he hath, now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its<br> griefs. I will teach him; I will cure his malady; yea, I will be his<br> elder brother, and care for him and watch over him; and whoso would<br> shame him or do him hurt may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for<br> it he shall need it!’<br><br> He bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying<br> interest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the<br> tangled curls with his great brown hand. A slight shiver passed over<br> the boy's form. Hendon muttered--<br><br> ‘See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill<br> his body with deadly rheums. Now what shall I do? 'twill wake him to<br> take him up and put him within the bed, and he sorely needeth sleep.’<br><br> He looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his doublet<br> and wrapped the lad in it, saying, ‘I am used to nipping air and scant<br> apparel, 'tis little I shall mind the cold!’--then walked up and down<br> the room, to keep his blood in motion, soliloquising as before.<br><br> ‘His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; 'twill be odd to<br> have a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that _was_ the prince<br> is prince no more, but king--for this poor mind is set upon the one<br> fantasy, and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince<br> and call itself the king. . . If my father liveth still, after these<br> seven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon, he<br> will welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake; so<br> will my good elder brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh--but I will<br> crack his crown an _he_ interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned<br> animal! Yes, thither will we fare--and straightway, too.’<br><br> A servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small deal<br> table, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such cheap<br> lodgers as these to wait upon themselves. The door slammed after him,<br> and the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a sitting posture, and shot<br> a glad glance about him; then a grieved look came into his face and he<br> murmured to himself, with a deep sigh, ‘Alack, it was but a dream, woe<br> is me!’ Next he noticed Miles Hendon's doublet--glanced from that to<br> Hendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said,<br> gently--<br><br> ‘Thou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to me. Take it and put it<br> on--I shall not need it more.’<br><br> Then he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood<br> there, waiting. Hendon said in a cheery voice--<br><br> ‘We'll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is savoury<br> and smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make thee a little<br> man again, never fear!’<br><br> The boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled with<br> grave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience, upon the tall<br> knight of the sword. Hendon was puzzled, and said--<br><br> ‘What's amiss?’<br><br> ‘Good sir, I would wash me.’<br><br> ‘Oh, is that all? Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou<br> cravest. Make thyself perfectly free here, and welcome, with all that<br> are his belongings.’<br><br> Still the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor once or<br> twice with his small impatient foot. Hendon was wholly perplexed. Said<br> he--<br><br> ‘Bless us, what is it?’<br><br> ‘Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!’<br><br> Hendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, ‘By all the<br> saints, but this is admirable!’ stepped briskly forward and did the<br> small insolent's bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction,<br> until the command, ‘Come--the towel!’ woke him sharply up. He took up a<br> towel, from under the boy's nose, and handed it to him without comment.<br> He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash, and while he was<br> at it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall<br> to. Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the<br> other chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said,<br> indignantly--<br><br> ‘Forbear! Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?’<br><br> This blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. He muttered to himself,<br> ‘Lo, the poor thing's madness is up with the time! It hath changed<br> with the great change that is come to the realm, and now in fancy is<br> he _king_! Good lack, I must humour the conceit, too--there is no other<br> way--faith, he would order me to the Tower, else!’<br><br> And pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table,<br> took his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in the<br> courtliest way he was capable of.<br><br> While the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little,<br> and with his growing contentment came a desire to talk. He said--’I<br> think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?’<br><br> ‘Yes, Sire,’ Miles replied; then observed to himself, ‘If I _must_<br> humour the poor lad's madness, I must 'Sire' him, I must 'Majesty' him,<br> I must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the<br> part I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable<br> and kindly cause.’<br><br> The King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and said--’I<br> would know thee--tell me thy story. Thou hast a gallant way with thee,<br> and a noble--art nobly born?’<br><br> ‘We are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty. My father is<br> a baronet--one of the smaller lords by knight service {2}--Sir Richard<br> Hendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk's Holm in Kent.’<br><br> ‘The name has escaped my memory. Go on--tell me thy story.’<br><br> ‘'Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a short<br> half-hour for want of a better. My father, Sir Richard, is very rich,<br> and of a most generous nature. My mother died whilst I was yet a<br> boy. I have two brothers: Arthur, my elder, with a soul like to<br> his father's; and Hugh, younger than I, a mean spirit, covetous,<br> treacherous, vicious, underhanded--a reptile. Such was he from the<br> cradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw him--a ripe rascal<br> at nineteen, I being twenty then, and Arthur twenty-two. There is<br> none other of us but the Lady Edith, my cousin--she was sixteen<br> then--beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her<br> race, heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title. My father was her<br> guardian. I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur<br> from the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be<br> broken. Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and<br> hold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give<br> success to our several causes. Hugh loved the Lady Edith's fortune,<br> though in truth he said it was herself he loved--but then 'twas his way,<br> alway, to say the one thing and mean the other. But he lost his arts<br> upon the girl; he could deceive my father, but none else. My father<br> loved him best of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the<br> youngest child, and others hated him--these qualities being in all<br> ages sufficient to win a parent's dearest love; and he had a smooth<br> persuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying--and these be<br> qualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself.<br> I was wild--in troth I might go yet farther and say _very_ wild, though<br> 'twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, brought<br> shame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness,<br> or what might not beseem mine honourable degree.<br><br> ‘Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account--he seeing<br> that our brother Arthur's health was but indifferent, and hoping the<br> worst might work him profit were I swept out of the path--so--but 'twere<br> a long tale, good my liege, and little worth the telling. Briefly,<br> then, this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them<br> crimes; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine<br> apartments--conveyed thither by his own means--and did convince my<br> father by this, and suborned evidence of servants and other lying<br> knaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in<br> rank defiance of his will.<br><br> ‘Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier<br> and a man of me, my father said, and teach me some degree of wisdom.<br> I fought out my long probation in the continental wars, tasting<br> sumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure; but in my last<br> battle I was taken captive, and during the seven years that have waxed<br> and waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath harboured me. Through wit<br> and courage I won to the free air at last, and fled hither straight; and<br> am but just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still<br> in knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall,<br> its people and belongings. So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told.’<br><br> ‘Thou hast been shamefully abused!’ said the little King, with a<br> flashing eye. ‘But I will right thee--by the cross will I! The King<br> hath said it.’<br><br> Then, fired by the story of Miles's wrongs, he loosed his tongue and<br> poured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his<br> astonished listener. When he had finished, Miles said to himself--<br><br> ‘Lo, what an imagination he hath! Verily, this is no common mind; else,<br> crazed or sane, it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this<br> out of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt.<br> Poor ruined little head, it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I<br> bide with the living. He shall never leave my side; he shall be my<br> pet, my little comrade. And he shall be cured!--ay, made whole and<br> sound--then will he make himself a name--and proud shall I be to say,<br> 'Yes, he is mine--I took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw<br> what was in him, and I said his name would be heard some day--behold<br> him, observe him--was I right?'‘<br><br> The King spoke--in a thoughtful, measured voice--<br><br> ‘Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so my<br> crown. Such service demandeth rich reward. Name thy desire, and so it<br> be within the compass of my royal power, it is thine.’<br><br> This fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie. He was<br> about to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only<br> done his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought came into his<br> head, and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the<br> gracious offer--an idea which the King gravely approved, remarking that<br> it was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import.<br><br> Miles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, ‘Yes, that is<br> the thing to do--by any other means it were impossible to get at it--and<br> certes, this hour's experience has taught me 'twould be most wearing and<br> inconvenient to continue it as it is. Yes, I will propose it; 'twas a<br> happy accident that I did not throw the chance away.’ Then he dropped<br> upon one knee and said--<br><br> ‘My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject's simple duty,<br> and therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold<br> it worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition to this<br> effect. Near four hundred years ago, as your grace knoweth, there being<br> ill blood betwixt John, King of England, and the King of France, it was<br> decreed that two champions should fight together in the lists, and so<br> settle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God. These two<br> kings, and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the<br> conflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he, that<br> our English knights refused to measure weapons with him. So the matter,<br> which was a weighty one, was like to go against the English monarch by<br> default. Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in<br> England, stripped of his honours and possessions, and wasting with<br> long captivity. Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth<br> arrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge<br> frame and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the French king's<br> cause was lost. King John restored De Courcy's titles and possessions,<br> and said, 'Name thy wish and thou shalt have it, though it cost me half<br> my kingdom;' whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made answer,<br> 'This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my successors may have and<br> hold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of<br> England, henceforth while the throne shall last.' The boon was granted,<br> as your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred<br> years, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day,<br> the head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the<br> King's Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do.<br> {3} Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to<br> grant to me but this one grace and privilege--to my more than sufficient<br> reward--and none other, to wit: that I and my heirs, for ever, may<br> _sit_ in the presence of the Majesty of England!’<br><br> ‘Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight,’ said the King, gravely--giving the<br> accolade with Hendon's sword--’rise, and seat thyself. Thy petition is<br> granted. Whilst England remains, and the crown continues, the privilege<br> shall not lapse.’<br><br> His Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at<br> table, observing to himself, ‘'Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought<br> me a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. An I had not<br> thought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad's<br> wits are cured.’ After a little, he went on, ‘And so I am become a<br> knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! A most odd and strange<br> position, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I. I will not laugh--no,<br> God forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is _real_ to<br> him. And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects<br> with truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him.’ After<br> a pause: ‘Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title before<br> folk!--there'd be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment! But<br> no matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be<br> content.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIII. The disappearance of the Prince.<br><br> A heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades. The King<br> said--<br><br> ‘Remove these rags.’--meaning his clothing.<br><br> Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in<br> bed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself, ruefully, ‘He hath<br> taken my bed again, as before--marry, what shall _I_ do?’ The little<br> King observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word. He said,<br> sleepily--<br><br> ‘Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it.’ In a moment more he<br> was out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.<br><br> ‘Dear heart, he should have been born a king!’ muttered Hendon,<br> admiringly; ‘he playeth the part to a marvel.’<br><br> Then he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying<br> contentedly--<br><br> ‘I have lodged worse for seven years; 'twould be but ill gratitude to<br> Him above to find fault with this.’<br><br> He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared. Toward noon he rose, uncovered<br> his unconscious ward--a section at a time--and took his measure with a<br> string. The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained<br> of the cold, and asked what he was doing.<br><br> ‘'Tis done, now, my liege,’ said Hendon; ‘I have a bit of business<br> outside, but will presently return; sleep thou again--thou needest it.<br> There--let me cover thy head also--thou'lt be warm the sooner.’<br><br> The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended. Miles<br> slipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of<br> thirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy's<br> clothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and<br> suited to the season of the year. He seated himself, and began to<br> overhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself--<br><br> ‘A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the<br> long purse one must be content with what a short one may do--<br><br> ‘'There was a woman in our town, In our town did dwell--'<br><br> ‘He stirred, methinks--I must sing in a less thunderous key; 'tis not<br> good to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied<br> out, poor chap . . . This garment--'tis well enough--a stitch here and<br> another one there will set it aright. This other is better, albeit a<br> stitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise . . . _These_ be very<br> good and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry--an odd new<br> thing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare,<br> winters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one<br> getteth a year's sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle<br> without cost, for mere love. Now shall I have the demon's own time to<br> thread it!’<br><br> And so he had. He did as men have always done, and probably always will<br> do, to the end of time--held the needle still, and tried to thrust the<br> thread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman's way. Time<br> and time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side<br> of the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the<br> shaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before,<br> when he was soldiering. He succeeded at last, and took up the garment<br> that had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.<br><br> ‘The inn is paid--the breakfast that is to come, included--and there is<br> wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs<br> for the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at<br> Hendon Hall--<br><br> ‘'She loved her hus--'<br><br> ‘Body o' me! I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . It matters<br> little--'tis not a novelty--yet 'tis not a convenience, neither. . . .<br> We shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy troubles will<br> vanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper--<br><br> ‘'She loved her husband dearilee, But another man--'<br><br> ‘These be noble large stitches!’--holding the garment up and viewing<br> it admiringly--’they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause<br> these small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and<br> plebeian--<br><br> ‘'She loved her husband dearilee, But another man he loved she,--'<br><br> ‘Marry, 'tis done--a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with<br> expedition. Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him,<br> and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark<br> and--be pleased to rise, my liege!--he answereth not--what ho, my<br> liege!--of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith<br> his slumber is deaf to speech. What!’<br><br> He threw back the covers--the boy was gone!<br><br> He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for<br> the first time that his ward's ragged raiment was also missing; then he<br> began to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper. At that moment a<br> servant entered with the breakfast.<br><br> ‘Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!’ roared the man of<br> war, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter<br> could not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise.<br> ‘Where is the boy?’<br><br> In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information<br> desired.<br><br> ‘You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth came<br> running and said it was your worship's will that the boy come to you<br> straight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side. I brought him<br> hither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message, the lad did<br> grumble some little for being disturbed 'so early,' as he called it, but<br> straightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth, only saying<br> it had been better manners that your worship came yourself, not sent a<br> stranger--and so--’<br><br> ‘And so thou'rt a fool!--a fool and easily cozened--hang all thy breed!<br> Yet mayhap no hurt is done. Possibly no harm is meant the boy. I will<br> go fetch him. Make the table ready. Stay! the coverings of the bed<br> were disposed as if one lay beneath them--happened that by accident?’<br><br> ‘I know not, good your worship. I saw the youth meddle with them--he<br> that came for the boy.’<br><br> ‘Thousand deaths! 'Twas done to deceive me--'tis plain 'twas done to<br> gain time. Hark ye! Was that youth alone?’<br><br> ‘All alone, your worship.’<br><br> ‘Art sure?’<br><br> ‘Sure, your worship.’<br><br> ‘Collect thy scattered wits--bethink thee--take time, man.’<br><br> After a moment's thought, the servant said--<br><br> ‘When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as the two<br> stepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged out<br> from some near place; and just as he was joining them--’<br><br> ‘What _then_?--out with it!’ thundered the impatient Hendon,<br> interrupting.<br><br> ‘Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I saw no<br> more, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a joint that<br> the scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all the saints to<br> witness that to blame _me_ for that miscarriage were like holding the<br> unborn babe to judgment for sins com--’<br><br> ‘Out of my sight, idiot! Thy prating drives me mad! Hold! Whither art<br> flying? Canst not bide still an instant? Went they toward Southwark?’<br><br> ‘Even so, your worship--for, as I said before, as to that detestable<br> joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--’<br><br> ‘Art here _yet_! And prating still! Vanish, lest I throttle thee!’ The<br> servitor vanished. Hendon followed after him, passed him, and plunged<br> down the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, ‘'Tis that scurvy<br> villain that claimed he was his son. I have lost thee, my poor little<br> mad master--it is a bitter thought--and I had come to love thee so! No!<br> by book and bell, _not_ lost! Not lost, for I will ransack the land<br> till I find thee again. Poor child, yonder is his breakfast--and mine,<br> but I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it--speed, speed! that<br> is the word!’ As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes<br> upon the Bridge he several times said to himself--clinging to the<br> thought as if it were a particularly pleasing one--’He grumbled, but he<br> _went_--he went, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet<br> lad--he would ne'er have done it for another, I know it well.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIV. 'Le Roi est mort--vive le Roi.'<br><br> Toward daylight of the same morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy<br> sleep and opened his eyes in the dark. He lay silent a few moments,<br> trying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions, and get some<br> sort of meaning out of them; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous<br> but guarded voice--<br><br> ‘I see it all, I see it all! Now God be thanked, I am indeed awake at<br> last! Come, joy! vanish, sorrow! Ho, Nan! Bet! kick off your straw and<br> hie ye hither to my side, till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the<br> wildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to<br> astonish the soul of man withal! . . . Ho, Nan, I say! Bet!’<br><br> A dim form appeared at his side, and a voice said--<br><br> ‘Wilt deign to deliver thy commands?’<br><br> ‘Commands? . . . O, woe is me, I know thy voice! Speak thou--who am I?’<br><br> ‘Thou? In sooth, yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales; to-day art<br> thou my most gracious liege, Edward, King of England.’<br><br> Tom buried his head among his pillows, murmuring plaintively--<br><br> ‘Alack, it was no dream! Go to thy rest, sweet sir--leave me to my<br> sorrows.’<br><br> Tom slept again, and after a time he had this pleasant dream. He<br> thought it was summer, and he was playing, all alone, in the fair meadow<br> called Goodman's Fields, when a dwarf only a foot high, with long red<br> whiskers and a humped back, appeared to him suddenly and said, ‘Dig by<br> that stump.’ He did so, and found twelve bright new pennies--wonderful<br> riches! Yet this was not the best of it; for the dwarf said--<br><br> ‘I know thee. Thou art a good lad, and a deserving; thy distresses<br> shall end, for the day of thy reward is come. Dig here every seventh<br> day, and thou shalt find always the same treasure, twelve bright new<br> pennies. Tell none--keep the secret.’<br><br> Then the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize,<br> saying to himself, ‘Every night will I give my father a penny; he<br> will think I begged it, it will glad his heart, and I shall no more<br> be beaten. One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall<br> have; mother, Nan, and Bet the other four. We be done with hunger and<br> rags, now, done with fears and frets and savage usage.’<br><br> In his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath, but with<br> eyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm; cast four of his pennies into his<br> mother's lap and cried out--<br><br> ‘They are for thee!--all of them, every one!--for thee and Nan and<br> Bet--and honestly come by, not begged nor stolen!’<br><br> The happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and<br> exclaimed--<br><br> ‘It waxeth late--may it please your Majesty to rise?’<br><br> Ah! that was not the answer he was expecting. The dream had snapped<br> asunder--he was awake.<br><br> He opened his eyes--the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was<br> kneeling by his couch. The gladness of the lying dream faded away--the<br> poor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king. The room<br> was filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles--the mourning<br> colour--and with noble servants of the monarch. Tom sat up in bed and<br> gazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company.<br><br> The weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another<br> knelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences<br> upon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded. In the beginning, a<br> shirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the<br> First Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of<br> the Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest,<br> who passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the<br> Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master<br> of the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to<br> the Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the<br> Household, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it<br> to the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of<br> Canterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took<br> what was left of it and put it on Tom. Poor little wondering chap, it<br> reminded him of passing buckets at a fire.<br><br> Each garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process;<br> consequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony; so weary that he felt<br> an almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose<br> begin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter<br> was drawing near. But he exulted too soon. The First Lord of the<br> Bedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom's legs in them,<br> when a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things<br> back into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded<br> look and a whispered, ‘See, my lord!’ pointing to a something connected<br> with the hose. The Archbishop paled, then flushed, and passed the<br> hose to the Lord High Admiral, whispering, ‘See, my lord!’ The Admiral<br> passed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, and had hardly breath<br> enough in his body to ejaculate, ‘See, my lord!’ The hose drifted<br> backward along the line, to the Chief Steward of the Household, the<br> Constable of the Tower, Norroy King-at-Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe,<br> the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom of the<br> Stole, the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, the Second Gentleman of the<br> Bedchamber, the First Lord of the Buckhounds,--accompanied always with<br> that amazed and frightened ‘See! see!’--till they finally reached the<br> hands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a pallid<br> face, upon what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely whispered,<br> ‘Body of my life, a tag gone from a truss-point!--to the Tower with<br> the Head Keeper of the King's Hose!’--after which he leaned upon the<br> shoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to regather his vanished<br> strength whilst fresh hose, without any damaged strings to them, were<br> brought.<br><br> But all things must have an end, and so in time Tom Canty was in a<br> condition to get out of bed. The proper official poured water, the<br> proper official engineered the washing, the proper official stood by<br> with a towel, and by-and-by Tom got safely through the purifying stage<br> and was ready for the services of the Hairdresser-royal. When he at<br> length emerged from this master's hands, he was a gracious figure and<br> as pretty as a girl, in his mantle and trunks of purple satin, and<br> purple-plumed cap. He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room,<br> through the midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he passed, these<br> fell back, leaving his way free, and dropped upon their knees.<br><br> After breakfast he was conducted, with regal ceremony, attended by his<br> great officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt<br> battle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded to transact business<br> of state. His 'uncle,' Lord Hertford, took his stand by the throne, to<br> assist the royal mind with wise counsel.<br><br> The body of illustrious men named by the late King as his executors<br> appeared, to ask Tom's approval of certain acts of theirs--rather a<br> form, and yet not wholly a form, since there was no Protector as yet.<br> The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of the decree of the Council<br> of Executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious<br> Majesty, and finished by reading the signatures of the Executors, to<br> wit: the Archbishop of Canterbury; the Lord Chancellor of England;<br> William Lord St. John; John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John<br> Viscount Lisle; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham--<br><br> Tom was not listening--an earlier clause of the document was puzzling<br> him. At this point he turned and whispered to Lord Hertford--<br><br> ‘What day did he say the burial hath been appointed for?’<br><br> ‘The sixteenth of the coming month, my liege.’<br><br> ‘'Tis a strange folly. Will he keep?’<br><br> Poor chap, he was still new to the customs of royalty; he was used to<br> seeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the way with a<br> very different sort of expedition. However, the Lord Hertford set his<br> mind at rest with a word or two.<br><br> A secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the<br> morrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and<br> desired the King's assent.<br><br> Tom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered--<br><br> ‘Your Majesty will signify consent. They come to testify their royal<br> masters' sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your Grace and<br> the realm of England.’<br><br> Tom did as he was bidden. Another secretary began to read a preamble<br> concerning the expenses of the late King's household, which had amounted<br> to 28,000 pounds during the preceding six months--a sum so vast that it<br> made Tom Canty gasp; he gasped again when the fact appeared that 20,000<br> pounds of this money was still owing and unpaid; {4} and once more when<br> it appeared that the King's coffers were about empty, and his twelve<br> hundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them. Tom<br> spoke out, with lively apprehension--<br><br> ‘We be going to the dogs, 'tis plain. 'Tis meet and necessary that we<br> take a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no<br> value but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the<br> spirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath<br> nor brains nor hands to help itself withal. I remember me of a small<br> house that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate--’<br><br> A sharp pressure upon Tom's arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a<br> blush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this<br> strange speech had been remarked or given concern.<br><br> A secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had provided in<br> his will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl of Hertford and<br> raising his brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, to the peerage, and likewise<br> Hertford's son to an earldom, together with similar aggrandisements to<br> other great servants of the Crown, the Council had resolved to hold a<br> sitting on the 16th of February for the delivering and confirming of<br> these honours, and that meantime, the late King not having granted,<br> in writing, estates suitable to the support of these dignities, the<br> Council, knowing his private wishes in that regard, had thought proper<br> to grant to Seymour '500 pound lands,' and to Hertford's son '800<br> pound lands, and 300 pound of the next bishop's lands which should fall<br> vacant,'--his present Majesty being willing. {5}<br><br> Tom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the<br> late King's debts first, before squandering all this money, but a<br> timely touch upon his arm, from the thoughtful Hertford, saved him<br> this indiscretion; wherefore he gave the royal assent, without spoken<br> comment, but with much inward discomfort. While he sat reflecting a<br> moment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering<br> miracles, a happy thought shot into his mind: why not make his mother<br> Duchess of Offal Court, and give her an estate? But a sorrowful<br> thought swept it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave<br> veterans and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only<br> the creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his project<br> with unbelieving ears, then send for the doctor.<br><br> The dull work went tediously on. Petitions were read, and<br> proclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and<br> wearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom sighed<br> pathetically and murmured to himself, ‘In what have I offended, that the<br> good God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the<br> sunshine, to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so?’<br> Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his<br> shoulder; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want<br> of that august factor, the ratifying power. Silence ensued around<br> the slumbering child, and the sages of the realm ceased from their<br> deliberations.<br><br> During the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of his<br> keepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the little<br> Lady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued<br> by the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house; and at the<br> end of the visit his 'elder sister'--afterwards the 'Bloody Mary' of<br> history--chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in<br> his eyes, its brevity. He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim<br> lad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose<br> clothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of<br> black,--doublet, hose, and all. He bore no badge of mourning but a knot<br> of purple ribbon on his shoulder. He advanced hesitatingly, with head<br> bowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom. Tom sat still<br> and contemplated him soberly a moment. Then he said--<br><br> ‘Rise, lad. Who art thou. What wouldst have?’<br><br> The boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of concern<br> in his face. He said--<br><br> ‘Of a surety thou must remember me, my lord. I am thy whipping-boy.’<br><br> ‘My _whipping_-boy?’<br><br> ‘The same, your Grace. I am Humphrey--Humphrey Marlow.’<br><br> Tom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have<br> posted him about. The situation was delicate. What should he<br> do?--pretend he knew this lad, and then betray by his every utterance<br> that he had never heard of him before? No, that would not do. An idea<br> came to his relief: accidents like this might be likely to happen with<br> some frequency, now that business urgencies would often call Hertford<br> and St. John from his side, they being members of the Council of<br> Executors; therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan<br> himself to meet the requirements of such emergencies. Yes, that would<br> be a wise course--he would practise on this boy, and see what sort of<br> success he might achieve. So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment<br> or two, and presently said--<br><br> ‘Now I seem to remember thee somewhat--but my wit is clogged and dim<br> with suffering--’<br><br> ‘Alack, my poor master!’ ejaculated the whipping-boy, with feeling;<br> adding, to himself, ‘In truth 'tis as they said--his mind is gone--alas,<br> poor soul! But misfortune catch me, how am I forgetting! They said one<br> must not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him.’<br><br> ‘'Tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days,’ said Tom.<br> ‘But mind it not--I mend apace--a little clue doth often serve to bring<br> me back again the things and names which had escaped me. (And not they,<br> only, forsooth, but e'en such as I ne'er heard before--as this lad shall<br> see.) Give thy business speech.’<br><br> ‘'Tis matter of small weight, my liege, yet will I touch upon it, an' it<br> please your Grace. Two days gone by, when your Majesty faulted thrice<br> in your Greek--in the morning lessons,--dost remember it?’<br><br> ‘Y-e-s--methinks I do. (It is not much of a lie--an' I had meddled with<br> the Greek at all, I had not faulted simply thrice, but forty times.)<br> Yes, I do recall it, now--go on.’<br><br> ‘The master, being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish<br> work, did promise that he would soundly whip me for it--and--’<br><br> ‘Whip _thee_!’ said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind. ‘Why<br> should he whip _thee_ for faults of mine?’<br><br> ‘Ah, your Grace forgetteth again. He always scourgeth me when thou dost<br> fail in thy lessons.’<br><br> ‘True, true--I had forgot. Thou teachest me in private--then if I fail,<br> he argueth that thy office was lamely done, and--’<br><br> ‘Oh, my liege, what words are these? I, the humblest of thy servants,<br> presume to teach _thee_?’<br><br> ‘Then where is thy blame? What riddle is this? Am I in truth gone mad,<br> or is it thou? Explain--speak out.’<br><br> ‘But, good your Majesty, there's nought that needeth simplifying.--None<br> may visit the sacred person of the Prince of Wales with blows;<br> wherefore, when he faulteth, 'tis I that take them; and meet it is and<br> right, for that it is mine office and my livelihood.’ {1}<br><br> Tom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, ‘Lo, it is a<br> wonderful thing,--a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they have<br> not hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me--would<br> heaven they would!--an' they will do this thing, I will take my lashings<br> in mine own person, giving God thanks for the change.’ Then he said<br> aloud--<br><br> ‘And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the promise?’<br><br> ‘No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and<br> peradventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning<br> that is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither<br> and remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my<br> behalf--’<br><br> ‘With the master? To save thee thy whipping?’<br><br> ‘Ah, thou dost remember!’<br><br> ‘My memory mendeth, thou seest. Set thy mind at ease--thy back shall go<br> unscathed--I will see to it.’<br><br> ‘Oh, thanks, my good lord!’ cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again.<br> ‘Mayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet--’<br><br> Seeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he<br> was ‘in the granting mood.’<br><br> ‘Then will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart. Sith thou art<br> no more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt,<br> with none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt<br> longer vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and<br> turn thy mind to things less irksome. Then am I ruined, and mine orphan<br> sisters with me!’<br><br> ‘Ruined? Prithee how?’<br><br> ‘My back is my bread, O my gracious liege! if it go idle, I starve. An'<br> thou cease from study mine office is gone thou'lt need no whipping-boy.<br> Do not turn me away!’<br><br> Tom was touched with this pathetic distress. He said, with a right<br> royal burst of generosity--<br><br> ‘Discomfort thyself no further, lad. Thine office shall be permanent in<br> thee and thy line for ever.’ Then he struck the boy a light blow on the<br> shoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, ‘Rise, Humphrey Marlow,<br> Hereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England! Banish<br> sorrow--I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they<br> must in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine<br> office be augmented.’<br><br> The grateful Humphrey responded fervidly--<br><br> ‘Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass<br> my most distempered dreams of fortune. Now shall I be happy all my<br> days, and all the house of Marlow after me.’<br><br> Tom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful<br> to him. He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath.<br> He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom's 'cure'; for<br> always, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom's diseased mind<br> the various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal<br> school-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then<br> able to 'recall' the circumstances quite clearly. At the end of an<br> hour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information<br> concerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he<br> resolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he<br> would give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might<br> come, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people.<br> Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with<br> more trouble for Tom.<br><br> He said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought<br> report of the King's damaged health might have leaked out and got<br> abroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to<br> dine in public after a day or two--his wholesome complexion and vigorous<br> step, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and<br> grace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse--in case<br> any evil rumours _had_ gone about--than any other scheme that could be<br> devised.<br><br> Then the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the<br> observances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin<br> disguise of 'reminding' him concerning things already known to him; but<br> to his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help<br> in this line--he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for<br> Humphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine<br> in public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court.<br> Tom kept these facts to himself, however.<br><br> Seeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a<br> few tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its<br> amendment had progressed. The results were happy, here and there, in<br> spots--spots where Humphrey's tracks remained--and on the whole my lord<br> was greatly pleased and encouraged. So encouraged was he, indeed, that<br> he spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice--<br><br> ‘Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet<br> a little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal--a loss<br> which was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term<br> of service ended with our late lord's life. May it please your Grace to<br> make the trial?’<br><br> Tom was at sea--a Great Seal was something which he was totally<br> unacquainted with. After a moment's hesitation he looked up innocently<br> and asked--<br><br> ‘What was it like, my lord?’<br><br> The Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, ‘Alack,<br> his wits are flown again!--it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain<br> them’--then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose<br> of sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom's thoughts--a purpose which<br> easily succeeded.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XV. Tom as King.<br><br> The next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains;<br> and Tom, throned in awful state, received them. The splendours of the<br> scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but<br> the audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the<br> addresses--wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and<br> home-sickness by-and-by. Tom said the words which Hertford put into<br> his mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself<br> satisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease<br> to accomplish more than a tolerable success. He looked sufficiently<br> like a king, but he was ill able to feel like one. He was cordially<br> glad when the ceremony was ended.<br><br> The larger part of his day was 'wasted'--as he termed it, in his own<br> mind--in labours pertaining to his royal office. Even the two hours<br> devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a<br> burden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions<br> and ceremonious observances. However, he had a private hour with<br> his whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both<br> entertainment and needful information out of it.<br><br> The third day of Tom Canty's kingship came and went much as the others<br> had done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way--he felt<br> less uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his<br> circumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the<br> time; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and<br> embarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over<br> his head.<br><br> But for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach<br> without serious distress--the dining in public; it was to begin that<br> day. There were greater matters in the programme--for on that day<br> he would have to preside at a council which would take his views and<br> commands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign<br> nations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too,<br> Hertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector;<br> other things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to<br> Tom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all<br> by himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a<br> multitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,--and upon<br> his mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any.<br><br> Still, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came. It found<br> poor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he<br> could not shake it off. The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon<br> his hands, and wearied him. Once more he felt the sense of captivity<br> heavy upon him.<br><br> Late in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing<br> with the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour<br> appointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great<br> officials and courtiers.<br><br> After a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become<br> interested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the<br> palace gates--and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart<br> to take part in person in its stir and freedom--saw the van of a hooting<br> and shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest<br> and poorest degree approaching from up the road.<br><br> ‘I would I knew what 'tis about!’ he exclaimed, with all a boy's<br> curiosity in such happenings.<br><br> ‘Thou art the King!’ solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence.<br> ‘Have I your Grace's leave to act?’<br><br> ‘O blithely, yes! O gladly, yes!’ exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to<br> himself with a lively sense of satisfaction, ‘In truth, being a king is<br> not all dreariness--it hath its compensations and conveniences.’<br><br> The Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with<br> the order--<br><br> ‘Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its<br> movement. By the King's command!’<br><br> A few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing<br> steel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front<br> of the multitude. A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were<br> following a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes<br> committed against the peace and dignity of the realm.<br><br> Death--and a violent death--for these poor unfortunates! The thought<br> wrung Tom's heart-strings. The spirit of compassion took control of<br> him, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of<br> the offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals<br> had inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the<br> scaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned.<br> His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the<br> false shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had<br> blurted out the command--<br><br> ‘Bring them here!’<br><br> Then he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but<br> observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or<br> the waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter. The<br> page, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance<br> and retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command. Tom<br> experienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating<br> advantages of the kingly office. He said to himself, ‘Truly it is like<br> what I was used to feel when I read the old priest's tales, and did<br> imagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying<br> 'Do this, do that,' whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my<br> will.’<br><br> Now the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was<br> announced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was<br> quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery. But Tom was hardly<br> conscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so<br> intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter. He seated<br> himself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the<br> door with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the<br> company forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public<br> business and court gossip one with another.<br><br> In a little while the measured tread of military men was heard<br> approaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an<br> under-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king's guard. The civil<br> officer knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons<br> knelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom's<br> chair. Tom scanned the prisoners curiously. Something about the dress<br> or appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him. ‘Methinks<br> I have seen this man ere now . . . but the when or the where fail<br> me.’--Such was Tom's thought. Just then the man glanced quickly up and<br> quickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port<br> of sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was<br> sufficient. He said to himself: ‘Now is the matter clear; this is the<br> stranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life,<br> that windy, bitter, first day of the New Year--a brave good deed--pity<br> he hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case . . . I<br> have not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after,<br> upon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer<br> Canty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that<br> went before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by<br> comparison.’<br><br> Tom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence<br> for a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying--<br><br> ‘Good sir, what is this man's offence?’<br><br> The officer knelt, and answered--<br><br> ‘So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison.’<br><br> Tom's compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring<br> rescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock.<br><br> ‘The thing was proven upon him?’ he asked.<br><br> ‘Most clearly, sire.’<br><br> Tom sighed, and said--<br><br> ‘Take him away--he hath earned his death. 'Tis a pity, for he was a<br> brave heart--na--na, I mean he hath the _look_ of it!’<br><br> The prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy, and wrung<br> them despairingly, at the same time appealing imploringly to the 'King'<br> in broken and terrified phrases--<br><br> ‘O my lord the King, an' thou canst pity the lost, have pity upon me! I<br> am innocent--neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than<br> but lamely proved--yet I speak not of that; the judgment is gone forth<br> against me and may not suffer alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a<br> boon, for my doom is more than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the<br> King! in thy royal compassion grant my prayer--give commandment that I<br> be hanged!’<br><br> Tom was amazed. This was not the outcome he had looked for.<br><br> ‘Odds my life, a strange _boon_! Was it not the fate intended thee?’<br><br> ‘O good my liege, not so! It is ordered that I be _boiled alive_!’<br><br> The hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his<br> chair. As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out--<br><br> ‘Have thy wish, poor soul! an' thou had poisoned a hundred men thou<br> shouldst not suffer so miserable a death.’<br><br> The prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate<br> expressions of gratitude--ending with--<br><br> ‘If ever thou shouldst know misfortune--which God forefend!--may thy<br> goodness to me this day be remembered and requited!’<br><br> Tom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said--<br><br> ‘My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man's<br> ferocious doom?’<br><br> ‘It is the law, your Grace--for poisoners. In Germany coiners be boiled<br> to death in _oil_--not cast in of a sudden, but by a rope let down into<br> the oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet, then the legs, then--’<br><br> ‘O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!’ cried Tom, covering<br> his eyes with his hands to shut out the picture. ‘I beseech your good<br> lordship that order be taken to change this law--oh, let no more poor<br> creatures be visited with its tortures.’<br><br> The Earl's face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of<br> merciful and generous impulses--a thing not very common with his class<br> in that fierce age. He said--<br><br> ‘These your Grace's noble words have sealed its doom. History will<br> remember it to the honour of your royal house.’<br><br> The under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign<br> to wait; then he said--<br><br> ‘Good sir, I would look into this matter further. The man has said his<br> deed was but lamely proved. Tell me what thou knowest.’<br><br> ‘If the King's grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this<br> man entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay<br> sick--three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and<br> two say it was some minutes later--the sick man being alone at the time,<br> and sleeping--and presently the man came forth again and went his<br> way. The sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and<br> retchings.’<br><br> ‘Did any see the poison given? Was poison found?’<br><br> ‘Marry, no, my liege.’<br><br> ‘Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?’<br><br> ‘Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such<br> symptoms but by poison.’<br><br> Weighty evidence, this, in that simple age. Tom recognised its<br> formidable nature, and said--<br><br> ‘The doctor knoweth his trade--belike they were right. The matter hath<br> an ill-look for this poor man.’<br><br> ‘Yet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse. Many<br> testified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither,<br> did foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick<br> man _would die by poison_--and more, that a stranger would give it--a<br> stranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and<br> surely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill. Please your<br> Majesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due,<br> seeing it was _foretold_.’<br><br> This was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day. Tom<br> felt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this<br> poor fellow's guilt was proved. Still he offered the prisoner a chance,<br> saying--<br><br> ‘If thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak.’<br><br> ‘Nought that will avail, my King. I am innocent, yet cannot I make<br> it appear. I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in<br> Islington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I<br> was above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more,<br> my King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was _taking_ life, I<br> was _saving_ it. A drowning boy--’<br><br> ‘Peace! Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!’<br><br> ‘At ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New<br> Year, most illustrious--’<br><br> ‘Let the prisoner go free--it is the King's will!’<br><br> Another blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his<br> indecorum as well as he could by adding--<br><br> ‘It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained<br> evidence!’<br><br> A low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage. It was not<br> admiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the<br> propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing<br> which few there would have felt justified in either admitting or<br> admiring--no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which<br> Tom had displayed. Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect--<br><br> ‘This is no mad king--he hath his wits sound.’<br><br> ‘How sanely he put his questions--how like his former natural self was<br> this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!’<br><br> ‘God be thanked, his infirmity is spent! This is no weakling, but a<br> king. He hath borne himself like to his own father.’<br><br> The air being filled with applause, Tom's ear necessarily caught a<br> little of it. The effect which this had upon him was to put him<br> greatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying<br> sensations.<br><br> However, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant<br> thoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief<br> the woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command,<br> the two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him.<br><br> ‘What is it that these have done?’ he inquired of the sheriff.<br><br> ‘Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly<br> proven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that<br> they be hanged. They sold themselves to the devil--such is their<br> crime.’<br><br> Tom shuddered. He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked<br> thing. Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding<br> his curiosity for all that; so he asked--<br><br> ‘Where was this done?--and when?’<br><br> ‘On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty.’<br><br> Tom shuddered again.<br><br> ‘Who was there present?’<br><br> ‘Only these two, your grace--and _that other_.’<br><br> ‘Have these confessed?’<br><br> ‘Nay, not so, sire--they do deny it.’<br><br> ‘Then prithee, how was it known?’<br><br> ‘Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this<br> bred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified<br> it. In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so<br> obtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the<br> region round about. Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and<br> sooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it,<br> sith all had suffered by it.’<br><br> ‘Certes this is a serious matter.’ Tom turned this dark piece of<br> scoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked--<br><br> ‘Suffered the woman also by the storm?’<br><br> Several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of<br> the wisdom of this question. The sheriff, however, saw nothing<br> consequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness--<br><br> ‘Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her<br> habitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless.’<br><br> ‘Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She<br> had been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid<br> her soul, and her child's, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she<br> knoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not.’<br><br> The elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom's wisdom once more, and one<br> individual murmured, ‘An' the King be mad himself, according to report,<br> then is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I<br> wot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it.’<br><br> ‘What age hath the child?’ asked Tom.<br><br> ‘Nine years, please your Majesty.’<br><br> ‘By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself,<br> my lord?’ asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.<br><br> ‘The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty<br> matter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope<br> with the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders. The<br> _Devil_ may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto,<br> but not an Englishman--in this latter case the contract would be null<br> and void.’<br><br> ‘It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English<br> law denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!’ cried<br> Tom, with honest heat.<br><br> This novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored<br> away in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom's<br> originality as well as progress toward mental health.<br><br> The elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom's<br> words with an excited interest and a growing hope. Tom noticed this,<br> and it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and<br> unfriended situation. Presently he asked--<br><br> ‘How wrought they to bring the storm?’<br><br> ‘_By pulling off their stockings_, sire.’<br><br> This astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He<br> said, eagerly--<br><br> ‘It is wonderful! Hath it always this dread effect?’<br><br> ‘Always, my liege--at least if the woman desire it, and utter the<br> needful words, either in her mind or with her tongue.’<br><br> Tom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal--<br><br> ‘Exert thy power--I would see a storm!’<br><br> There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and<br> a general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place--all of<br> which was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed<br> cataclysm. Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman's face, he<br> added, excitedly--<br><br> ‘Never fear--thou shalt be blameless. More--thou shalt go free--none<br> shall touch thee. Exert thy power.’<br><br> ‘Oh, my lord the King, I have it not--I have been falsely accused.’<br><br> ‘Thy fears stay thee. Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.<br> Make a storm--it mattereth not how small a one--I require nought great<br> or harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite--do this and thy life is<br> spared--thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King's<br> pardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.’<br><br> The woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had<br> no power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child's life<br> alone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King's<br> command so precious a grace might be acquired.<br><br> Tom urged--the woman still adhered to her declarations. Finally he<br> said--<br><br> ‘I think the woman hath said true. An' _my_ mother were in her place<br> and gifted with the devil's functions, she had not stayed a moment to<br> call her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my<br> forfeit life were the price she got! It is argument that other<br> mothers are made in like mould. Thou art free, goodwife--thou and thy<br> child--for I do think thee innocent. _Now_ thou'st nought to fear,<br> being pardoned--pull off thy stockings!--an' thou canst make me a storm,<br> thou shalt be rich!’<br><br> The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to<br> obey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred<br> by apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided<br> discomfort and uneasiness. The woman stripped her own feet and her<br> little girl's also, and plainly did her best to reward the King's<br> generosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a<br> disappointment. Tom sighed, and said--<br><br> ‘There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed<br> out of thee. Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time,<br> forget me not, but fetch me a storm.’ {13}<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVI. The State Dinner.<br><br> The dinner hour drew near--yet strangely enough, the thought brought<br> but slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror. The morning's<br> experiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little<br> ash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four<br> days' habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month. A<br> child's facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more<br> strikingly illustrated.<br><br> Let us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a<br> glance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the<br> imposing occasion. It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars<br> and pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings. At the door stand tall<br> guards, as rigid as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes,<br> and bearing halberds. In a high gallery which runs all around the place<br> is a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes,<br> in brilliant attire. In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform,<br> is Tom's table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:<br><br> ‘A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another<br> bearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times<br> with the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after<br> kneeling again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod<br> again, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; when they have<br> kneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the<br> table, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first;<br> at last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife,<br> who, after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful<br> manner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe<br> as if the King had been present.’ {6}<br><br> So end the solemn preliminaries. Now, far down the echoing corridors<br> we hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, ‘Place for the King!<br> Way for the King's most excellent majesty!’ These sounds are momently<br> repeated--they grow nearer and nearer--and presently, almost in our<br> faces, the martial note peals and the cry rings out, ‘Way for the King!’<br> At this instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door,<br> with a measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:--<br><br> ‘First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly<br> dressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of<br> which carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red<br> scabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next<br> comes the King himself--whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and<br> many drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the<br> galleries rise in their places, crying 'God save the King!' After him<br> come nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his<br> guard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes.’<br><br> This was all fine and pleasant. Tom's pulse beat high, and a glad light<br> was in his eye. He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more<br> so because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being<br> charmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him--and<br> besides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful<br> clothes after he has grown a little used to them--especially if he is<br> for the moment unconscious of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and<br> acknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head,<br> and a courteous ‘I thank ye, my good people.’<br><br> He seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without<br> the least embarrassment; for to eat with one's cap on was the one<br> solitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon<br> common ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the<br> matter of old familiarity with it. The pageant broke up and grouped<br> itself picturesquely, and remained bareheaded.<br><br> Now to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,--’the<br> tallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in<br> this regard’--but we will let the chronicler tell about it:--<br><br> ‘The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with<br> golden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each<br> turn a course of dishes, served in plate. These dishes were received<br> by a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon<br> the table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the<br> particular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison.’<br><br> Tom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds<br> of eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an<br> interest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly<br> explosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about<br> the place. He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do<br> anything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt<br> down and did it for him. He got through without a mistake--flawless and<br> precious triumph.<br><br> When the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his<br> bright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles,<br> rolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen<br> the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad<br> to endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself<br> free from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVII. Foo-foo the First.<br><br> Miles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge,<br> keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and<br> expecting to overtake them presently. He was disappointed in this,<br> however. By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the<br> way through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as<br> to how to proceed. Still, he continued his efforts as best he<br> could during the rest of the day. Nightfall found him leg-weary,<br> half-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so<br> he supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early<br> start in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search. As he lay<br> thinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: The boy would<br> escape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go<br> back to London and seek his former haunts? No, he would not do that,<br> he would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do? Never having had a<br> friend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would<br> naturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not<br> require him to go toward London and danger. He would strike for Hendon<br> Hall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound<br> and there he might expect to find him. Yes, the case was plain to<br> Hendon--he must lose no more time in Southwark, but move at once through<br> Kent, toward Monk's Holm, searching the wood and inquiring as he went.<br> Let us return to the vanished little King now.<br><br> The ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw 'about to join'<br> the youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close<br> behind them and followed their steps. He said nothing. His left arm was<br> in a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped<br> slightly, and used an oaken staff as a support. The youth led the King<br> a crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the<br> high road beyond. The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop<br> here--it was Hendon's place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon. He<br> would not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was. The youth<br> said--<br><br> ‘Thou'lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder?<br> So be it, then.’<br><br> The King's manner changed at once. He cried out--<br><br> ‘Wounded? And who hath dared to do it? But that is apart; lead on,<br> lead on! Faster, sirrah! Art shod with lead? Wounded, is he? Now<br> though the doer of it be a duke's son he shall rue it!’<br><br> It was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed.<br> The youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground,<br> with a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest,<br> watching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were<br> evidently guides to the point he was aiming at. By-and-by an open place<br> was reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near<br> them a barn which was falling to ruin and decay. There was no sign of<br> life anywhere, and utter silence prevailed. The youth entered the barn,<br> the King following eagerly upon his heels. No one there! The King shot<br> a surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked--<br><br> ‘Where is he?’<br><br> A mocking laugh was his answer. The King was in a rage in a moment; he<br> seized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth<br> when another mocking laugh fell upon his ear. It was from the lame<br> ruffian who had been following at a distance. The King turned and said<br> angrily--<br><br> ‘Who art thou? What is thy business here?’<br><br> ‘Leave thy foolery,’ said the man, ‘and quiet thyself. My disguise is<br> none so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through<br> it.’<br><br> ‘Thou art not my father. I know thee not. I am the King. If thou hast<br> hid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou<br> hast done.’<br><br> John Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice--<br><br> ‘It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee; but if thou<br> provoke me, I must. Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are<br> no ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy<br> tongue to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change.<br> I have done a murder, and may not tarry at home--neither shalt thou,<br> seeing I need thy service. My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is<br> Hobbs--John Hobbs; thine is Jack--charge thy memory accordingly. Now,<br> then, speak. Where is thy mother? Where are thy sisters? They came<br> not to the place appointed--knowest thou whither they went?’<br><br> The King answered sullenly--<br><br> ‘Trouble me not with these riddles. My mother is dead; my sisters are<br> in the palace.’<br><br> The youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have<br> assaulted him, but Canty--or Hobbs, as he now called himself--prevented<br> him, and said--<br><br> ‘Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him.<br> Sit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat,<br> anon.’<br><br> Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King<br> removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company.<br> He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where<br> he found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw. He lay down<br> here, drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed<br> in thinking. He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost<br> into forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father. To<br> the rest of the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and<br> suggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand<br> dealt scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only<br> sensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that<br> was all gentleness and affection. He called to mind a long succession<br> of loving passages between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon<br> them, his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that<br> possessed his heart. As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with<br> his troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber.<br><br> After a considerable time--he could not tell how long--his senses<br> struggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes<br> vaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a<br> murmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof. A snug sense<br> of comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment,<br> by a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter. It startled him<br> disagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption<br> proceeded. A grim and unsightly picture met his eye. A bright fire was<br> burning in the middle of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and<br> around it, and lit weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the<br> motliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he<br> had ever read or dreamed of. There were huge stalwart men, brown<br> with exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were<br> middle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there<br> were blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones,<br> with wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping<br> from ineffectual wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with<br> his pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the<br> implements of their trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls,<br> some were at prime, some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud,<br> brazen, foul-mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were three<br> sore-faced babies; there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings<br> about their necks, whose office was to lead the blind.<br><br> The night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was<br> beginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A general<br> cry broke forth--<br><br> ‘A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!’<br><br> One of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches<br> that sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which<br> recited the cause of his calamity. Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself<br> of his timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs,<br> beside his fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty,<br> and were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in<br> a rousing chorus. By the time the last stanza was reached, the<br> half-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined<br> in and sang it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of<br> villainous sound that made the rafters quake. These were the inspiring<br> words:--<br><br> 'Bien Darkman's then, Bouse Mort and Ken, The bien Coves bings awast, On<br> Chates to trine by Rome Coves dine For his long lib at last. Bing'd out<br> bien Morts and toure, and toure, Bing out of the Rome vile bine, And<br> toure the Cove that cloy'd your duds, Upon the Chates to trine.'<br><br> (From'The English Rogue.' London, 1665.)<br><br> Conversation followed; not in the thieves' dialect of the song, for that<br> was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening. In the<br> course of it, it appeared that 'John Hobbs' was not altogether a new<br> recruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time. His later<br> history was called for, and when he said he had 'accidentally' killed a<br> man, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the<br> man was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with<br> everybody. Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were<br> proud to shake him by the hand. He was asked why he had 'tarried away<br> so many months.' He answered--<br><br> ‘London is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the<br> laws be so bitter and so diligently enforced. An' I had not had that<br> accident, I had stayed there. I had resolved to stay, and never more<br> venture country-wards--but the accident has ended that.’<br><br> He inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. The 'ruffler,' or<br> chief, answered--<br><br> ‘Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and<br> maunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. {7} Most are<br> here, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We follow<br> at dawn.’<br><br> ‘I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me. Where may he be?’<br><br> ‘Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate<br> taste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer.’<br><br> ‘I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave.’<br><br> ‘That was he, truly. Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on<br> the eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none<br> ever seeing her drunk above four days in the seven.’<br><br> ‘She was ever strict--I remember it well--a goodly wench and worthy<br> all commendation. Her mother was more free and less particular; a<br> troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above<br> the common.’<br><br> ‘We lost her through it. Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of<br> fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch's name and fame. The<br> law roasted her to death at a slow fire. It did touch me to a sort of<br> tenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot--cursing and reviling<br> all the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked<br> upward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about<br> her old gray head--cursing them! why an' thou should'st live a thousand<br> years thoud'st never hear so masterful a cursing. Alack, her art died<br> with her. There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true<br> blasphemy.’<br><br> The Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general<br> depression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened<br> outcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to<br> feel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and<br> under peculiarly favouring circumstances--as in cases like to this, for<br> instance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir. However, a<br> deep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners.<br><br> ‘Have any others of our friends fared hardly?’ asked Hobbs.<br><br> ‘Some--yes. Particularly new comers--such as small husbandmen turned<br> shiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from<br> them to be changed to sheep ranges. They begged, and were whipped at<br> the cart's tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set<br> in the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and<br> deprived of an ear; they begged a third time--poor devils, what else<br> could they do?--and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then<br> sold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged. 'Tis<br> a brief tale, and quickly told. Others of us have fared less hardly.<br> Stand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge--show your adornments!’<br><br> These stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their<br> backs, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned<br> up his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another<br> showed a brand upon his shoulder--the letter V--and a mutilated ear; the<br> third said--<br><br> ‘I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and<br> kids--now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife<br> and kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in--in the other<br> place--but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in _England_!<br> My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick;<br> one of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for<br> a witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed. English law!--up,<br> all, with your cups!--now all together and with a cheer!--drink to the<br> merciful English law that delivered _her_ from the English hell! Thank<br> you, mates, one and all. I begged, from house to house--I and the<br> wife--bearing with us the hungry kids--but it was crime to be hungry in<br> England--so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns. Drink<br> ye all again to the merciful English law!--for its lash drank deep of my<br> Mary's blood and its blessed deliverance came quick. She lies there, in<br> the potter's field, safe from all harms. And the kids--well, whilst<br> the law lashed me from town to town, they starved. Drink, lads--only<br> a drop--a drop to the poor kids, that never did any creature harm.<br> I begged again--begged, for a crust, and got the stocks and lost an<br> ear--see, here bides the stump; I begged again, and here is the stump<br> of the other to keep me minded of it. And still I begged again, and was<br> sold for a slave--here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off,<br> ye might see the red S the branding-iron left there! A _slave_! Do<br> you understand that word? An English _slave_!--that is he that stands<br> before ye. I have run from my master, and when I am found--the heavy<br> curse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it!--I<br> shall hang!’ {1}<br><br> A ringing voice came through the murky air--<br><br> ‘Thou shalt _not_!--and this day the end of that law is come!’<br><br> All turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching<br> hurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a<br> general explosion of inquiries broke out--<br><br> ‘Who is it? _What_ is it? Who art thou, manikin?’<br><br> The boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and<br> questioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity--<br><br> ‘I am Edward, King of England.’<br><br> A wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of<br> delight in the excellence of the joke. The King was stung. He said<br> sharply--<br><br> ‘Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I<br> have promised?’<br><br> He said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in<br> a whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations. 'John Hobbs' made<br> several attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last<br> succeeded--saying--<br><br> ‘Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad--mind him not--he<br> thinketh he _is_ the King.’<br><br> ‘I _am_ the King,’ said Edward, turning toward him, ‘as thou shalt know<br> to thy cost, in good time. Thou hast confessed a murder--thou shalt<br> swing for it.’<br><br> ‘_Thou'lt_ betray me?--_thou_? An' I get my hands upon thee--’<br><br> ‘Tut-tut!’ said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the<br> King, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist,<br> ‘hast respect for neither Kings _nor_ Rufflers? An' thou insult my<br> presence so again, I'll hang thee up myself.’ Then he said to his<br> Majesty, ‘Thou must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou<br> must guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere. _Be king_, if<br> it please thy mad humour, but be not harmful in it. Sink the title thou<br> hast uttered--'tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but<br> none among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving<br> and loyal hearts, in that regard. Note if I speak truth. Now--all<br> together: 'Long live Edward, King of England!'‘<br><br> ‘LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!’<br><br> The response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the<br> crazy building vibrated to the sound. The little King's face lighted<br> with pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and<br> said with grave simplicity--<br><br> ‘I thank you, my good people.’<br><br> This unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment.<br> When something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said,<br> firmly, but with an accent of good nature--<br><br> ‘Drop it, boy, 'tis not wise, nor well. Humour thy fancy, if thou must,<br> but choose some other title.’<br><br> A tinker shrieked out a suggestion--<br><br> ‘Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!’<br><br> The title 'took,' at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout<br> went up, of--<br><br> ‘Long live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!’ followed by<br> hootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter.<br><br> ‘Hale him forth, and crown him!’<br><br> ‘Robe him!’<br><br> ‘Sceptre him!’<br><br> ‘Throne him!’<br><br> These and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost before the<br> poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin,<br> robed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with<br> the tinker's soldering-iron. Then all flung themselves upon their<br> knees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking<br> supplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and<br> ragged sleeves and aprons--<br><br> ‘Be gracious to us, O sweet King!’<br><br> ‘Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!’<br><br> ‘Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!’<br><br> ‘Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of<br> sovereignty!’<br><br> ‘Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the<br> dirt and be ennobled!’<br><br> ‘Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children's children may tell of<br> thy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!’<br><br> But the humorous tinker made the 'hit' of the evening and carried off<br> the honours. Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King's foot, and was<br> indignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste<br> over the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying<br> it must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he<br> should make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to<br> view at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight. He made himself so<br> killingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy<br> rabble.<br><br> Tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch's eyes; and<br> the thought in his heart was, ‘Had I offered them a deep wrong they<br> could not be more cruel--yet have I proffered nought but to do them a<br> kindness--and it is thus they use me for it!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVIII. The Prince with the Tramps.<br><br> The troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on<br> their march. There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under<br> foot, and a winter chill in the air. All gaiety was gone from the<br> company; some were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant,<br> none were gentle-humoured, all were thirsty.<br><br> The Ruffler put 'Jack' in Hugo's charge, with some brief instructions,<br> and commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he<br> also warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad.<br><br> After a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat.<br> The troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve. They<br> grew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and<br> insult passengers along the highway. This showed that they were awaking<br> to an appreciation of life and its joys once more. The dread in which<br> their sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them<br> the road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing<br> to talk back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full<br> view of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that<br> they did not take the hedges, too.<br><br> By-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home<br> while the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to<br> furnish a breakfast for them. They chucked the housewife and her<br> daughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and<br> made coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and<br> bursts of horse-laughter. They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer<br> and his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously<br> when a good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of<br> the daughters who resented some of their familiarities. When they took<br> their leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the<br> heads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the<br> authorities.<br><br> About noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind<br> a hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village. An hour was allowed<br> for rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village<br> at different points to ply their various trades--'Jack' was sent with<br> Hugo. They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching<br> for opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none--so he<br> finally said--<br><br> ‘I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. Wherefore we will beg.’<br><br> ‘_We_, forsooth! Follow thy trade--it befits thee. But _I_ will not<br> beg.’<br><br> ‘Thou'lt not beg!’ exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise.<br> ‘Prithee, since when hast thou reformed?’<br><br> ‘What dost thou mean?’<br><br> ‘Mean? Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?’<br><br> ‘I? Thou idiot!’<br><br> ‘Spare thy compliments--thy stock will last the longer. Thy father says<br> thou hast begged all thy days. Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will<br> even make so bold as to _say_ he lied,’ scoffed Hugo.<br><br> ‘Him _you_ call my father? Yes, he lied.’<br><br> ‘Come, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy<br> amusement, not thy hurt. An' I tell him this, he will scorch thee<br> finely for it.’<br><br> ‘Save thyself the trouble. I will tell him.’<br><br> ‘I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment.<br> Bone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going<br> out of one's way to invite them. But a truce to these matters; _I_<br> believe your father. I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he _doth_<br> lie, upon occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion<br> here. A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for<br> nought. But come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging,<br> wherewithal shall we busy ourselves? With robbing kitchens?’<br><br> The King said, impatiently--<br><br> ‘Have done with this folly--you weary me!’<br><br> Hugo replied, with temper--<br><br> ‘Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it. But I<br> will tell you what you _will_ do. You will play decoy whilst _I_ beg.<br> Refuse, an' you think you may venture!’<br><br> The King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said,<br> interrupting--<br><br> ‘Peace! Here comes one with a kindly face. Now will I fall down in<br> a fit. When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon<br> your knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery<br> were in your belly, and say, 'Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother,<br> and we be friendless; o' God's name cast through your merciful eyes one<br> pitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow<br> one little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready<br> to perish!'--and mind you, keep you _on_ wailing, and abate not till we<br> bilk him of his penny, else shall you rue it.’<br><br> Then immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and<br> reel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he<br> sprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in<br> the dirt, in seeming agony.<br><br> ‘O, dear, O dear!’ cried the benevolent stranger, ‘O poor soul, poor<br> soul, how he doth suffer! There--let me help thee up.’<br><br> ‘O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman--but it<br> giveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so. My brother there<br> will tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be<br> upon me. A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave<br> me to my sorrows.’<br><br> ‘A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,’--and he fumbled<br> in his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. ‘There, poor lad,<br> take them and most welcome. Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry<br> thy stricken brother to yon house, where--’<br><br> ‘I am not his brother,’ said the King, interrupting.<br><br> ‘What! not his brother?’<br><br> ‘Oh, hear him!’ groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth. ‘He<br> denies his own brother--and he with one foot in the grave!’<br><br> ‘Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother. For<br> shame!--and he scarce able to move hand or foot. If he is not thy<br> brother, who is he, then?’<br><br> ‘A beggar and a thief! He has got your money and has picked your pocket<br> likewise. An' thou would'st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over<br> his shoulders and trust Providence for the rest.’<br><br> But Hugo did not tarry for the miracle. In a moment he was up and off<br> like the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry<br> lustily as he went. The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for<br> his own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken<br> his pace until he was out of harm's reach. He took the first road that<br> offered, and soon put the village behind him. He hurried along, as<br> briskly as he could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over<br> his shoulder for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful<br> sense of security took their place. He recognised, now, that he was<br> hungry, and also very tired. So he halted at a farmhouse; but when<br> he was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away. His<br> clothes were against him.<br><br> He wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself<br> in the way of like treatment no more. But hunger is pride's master; so,<br> as the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but<br> here he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was<br> promised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly.<br><br> The night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch<br> laboured slowly on. He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he<br> sat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold. All<br> his sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom<br> and the empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him. At<br> intervals he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and<br> as he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of<br> formless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about<br> it all that made him shudder. Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a<br> light--always far away, apparently--almost in another world; if he heard<br> the tinkle of a sheep's bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct;<br> the muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in<br> vanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining<br> howl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds<br> were remote; they made the little King feel that all life and activity<br> were far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in<br> the centre of a measureless solitude.<br><br> He stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new<br> experience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves<br> overhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he<br> came suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand. He<br> stepped back into the shadows and waited. The lantern stood by the<br> open door of a barn. The King waited some time--there was no sound,<br> and nobody stirring. He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable<br> barn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and<br> enter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing<br> the threshold he heard voices behind him. He darted behind a cask,<br> within the barn, and stooped down. Two farm-labourers came in, bringing<br> the lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile. Whilst they<br> moved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took<br> the bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end<br> of the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to<br> himself. He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway<br> of the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the<br> crown of England for one night.<br><br> By-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind<br> them and taking the lantern with them. The shivering King made for the<br> blankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them<br> up, and then groped his way safely to the stall. Of two of the blankets<br> he made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two. He was a<br> glad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite<br> warm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost<br> suffocatingly powerful.<br><br> Although the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so<br> drowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage<br> of the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of<br> semi-consciousness. Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself<br> wholly, he distinctly felt something touch him! He was broad awake in<br> a moment, and gasping for breath. The cold horror of that mysterious<br> touch in the dark almost made his heart stand still. He lay motionless,<br> and listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was<br> no sound. He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long<br> time, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. So he began<br> to drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that<br> mysterious touch again! It was a grisly thing, this light touch from<br> this noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly<br> fears. What should he do? That was the question; but he did not know<br> how to answer it. Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters<br> and fly from this inscrutable horror? But fly whither? He could<br> not get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and<br> thither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this<br> phantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch<br> upon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable. But to stay<br> where he was, and endure this living death all night--was that better?<br> No. What, then, was there left to do? Ah, there was but one course;<br> he knew it well--he must put out his hand and find that thing!<br><br> It was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try<br> it. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark,<br> gingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp--not because it<br> had encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just<br> _going_ to. But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his<br> hand lightly swept against something soft and warm. This petrified him,<br> nearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine<br> the thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.<br> He thought he would rather die than touch it again. But he thought this<br> false thought because he did not know the immortal strength of<br> human curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping<br> again--against his judgment, and without his consent--but groping<br> persistently on, just the same. It encountered a bunch of long hair; he<br> shuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm<br> rope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!--for the rope was<br> not a rope at all, but the calf's tail.<br><br> The King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that<br> fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he<br> need not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened<br> him, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and<br> any other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and<br> suffered just as he had done.<br><br> The King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a<br> calf, but delighted to have the calf's company; for he had been feeling<br> so lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even<br> this humble animal were welcome. And he had been so buffeted, so rudely<br> entreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel<br> that he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at<br> least a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes<br> might be lacking. So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with<br> the calf.<br><br> While stroking its sleek warm back--for it lay near him and within easy<br> reach--it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways<br> than one. Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to<br> the calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf's back, drew the covers<br> up over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and<br> comfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace<br> of Westminster.<br><br> Pleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming. He<br> was free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship<br> of base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he<br> was happy. The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts<br> that made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down<br> at intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and<br> projections--but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and<br> comfortable: let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan<br> and wail, he minded it not, he only enjoyed it. He merely snuggled<br> the closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted<br> blissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that<br> was full of serenity and peace. The distant dogs howled, the melancholy<br> kine complained, and the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets<br> of rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty of England slept on,<br> undisturbed, and the calf did the same, it being a simple creature, and<br> not easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIX. The Prince with the peasants.<br><br> When the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but<br> thoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy<br> bed for itself in his bosom. Being disturbed now, it scampered away.<br> The boy smiled, and said, ‘Poor fool, why so fearful? I am as forlorn<br> as thou. 'Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so<br> helpless. Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king<br> has fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely<br> meaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no<br> lower go.’<br><br> He got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound<br> of children's voices. The barn door opened and a couple of little girls<br> came in. As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and<br> they stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they<br> presently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and<br> stopped again to gaze and whisper. By-and-by they gathered courage and<br> began to discuss him aloud. One said--<br><br> ‘He hath a comely face.’<br><br> The other added--<br><br> ‘And pretty hair.’<br><br> ‘But is ill clothed enow.’<br><br> ‘And how starved he looketh.’<br><br> They came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining<br> him minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of<br> animal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he<br> might be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion. Finally they<br> halted before him, holding each other's hands for protection, and took a<br> good satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked<br> up all her courage and inquired with honest directness--<br><br> ‘Who art thou, boy?’<br><br> ‘I am the King,’ was the grave answer.<br><br> The children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide<br> open and remained so during a speechless half minute. Then curiosity<br> broke the silence--<br><br> ‘The _King_? What King?’<br><br> ‘The King of England.’<br><br> The children looked at each other--then at him--then at each other<br> again--wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said--<br><br> ‘Didst hear him, Margery?--he said he is the King. Can that be true?’<br><br> ‘How can it be else but true, Prissy? Would he say a lie? For look<br> you, Prissy, an' it were not true, it _would_ be a lie. It surely would<br> be. Now think on't. For all things that be not true, be lies--thou<br> canst make nought else out of it.’<br><br> It was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left<br> Prissy's half-doubts not a leg to stand on. She considered a moment,<br> then put the King upon his honour with the simple remark--<br><br> ‘If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee.’<br><br> ‘I am truly the King.’<br><br> This settled the matter. His Majesty's royalty was accepted without<br> further question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once<br> to inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so<br> unroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs. It<br> was a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not<br> be scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting<br> even his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and<br> tenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids. But when he got down<br> to his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without<br> food, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a<br> breakfast for him.<br><br> The King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, ‘When I<br> am come to mine own again, I will always honour little children,<br> remembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time<br> of trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves wiser,<br> mocked at me and held me for a liar.’<br><br> The children's mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity;<br> for his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her<br> womanly heart. She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had<br> seen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate. She<br> imagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or<br> keepers; so she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that<br> she might take measures to return him; but all her references to<br> neighbouring towns and villages, and all her inquiries in the same line<br> went for nothing--the boy's face, and his answers, too, showed that the<br> things she was talking of were not familiar to him. He spoke earnestly<br> and simply about court matters, and broke down, more than once, when<br> speaking of the late King 'his father'; but whenever the conversation<br> changed to baser topics, he lost interest and became silent.<br><br> The woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up. As she<br> proceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to<br> surprise the boy into betraying his real secret. She talked about<br> cattle--he showed no concern; then about sheep--the same result: so<br> her guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about<br> mills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all<br> sorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: but no<br> matter, she was baffled at all points. Not altogether, either; for she<br> argued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service. Yes,<br> she was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house<br> servant. So she led up to that. But the result was discouraging. The<br> subject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir<br> him; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched,<br> with a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject<br> of cooking. To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King's face<br> lighted at once! Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and<br> she was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had<br> accomplished it.<br><br> Her tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King's, inspired<br> by gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering<br> pots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an<br> eloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three<br> minutes the woman said to herself, ‘Of a truth I was right--he hath<br> holpen in a kitchen!’ Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed<br> it with such appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to<br> herself, ‘Good lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones<br> withal? For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great.<br> Ah, now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the<br> palace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in the<br> very kitchen of the King himself! I will test him.’<br><br> Full of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the<br> cooking a moment--hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or<br> two, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a<br> sign to follow after. The King muttered--<br><br> ‘Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone<br> time--it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the<br> great Alfred stooped to assume. But I will try to better serve my trust<br> than he; for he let the cakes burn.’<br><br> The intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for<br> this King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning<br> his vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted--the cookery got<br> burned. The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire<br> destruction; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a<br> brisk and cordial tongue-lashing. Then, seeing how troubled he was<br> over his violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and<br> gentleness toward him.<br><br> The boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and<br> gladdened by it. It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious<br> feature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient<br> of the favour was aware that it had been extended. The goodwife had<br> intended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner,<br> like any other tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the<br> scolding she had given him, that she did what she could to atone for it<br> by allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on<br> ostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side, was<br> so remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had been so<br> kind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself<br> to the family level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to<br> stand and wait upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary<br> state due to his birth and dignity. It does us all good to unbend<br> sometimes. This good woman was made happy all the day long by the<br> applauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension<br> to a tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious<br> humility toward a humble peasant woman.<br><br> When breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the<br> dishes. This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came<br> near rebelling; but then he said to himself, ‘Alfred the Great watched<br> the cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too--therefore will<br> I essay it.’<br><br> He made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the<br> cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do.<br> It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it<br> at last. He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now;<br> however, he was not to lose this thrifty dame's society so easily. She<br> furnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got<br> through with after a fair fashion and with some credit. Then she set<br> him and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so<br> awkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a<br> butcher knife to grind.<br><br> Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid<br> the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in<br> the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in<br> story-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign. And<br> when, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket<br> of kittens to drown, he did resign. At least he was just going to<br> resign--for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it<br> seemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right<br> thing--when there was an interruption. The interruption was John<br> Canty--with a peddler's pack on his back--and Hugo.<br><br> The King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they<br> had had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line,<br> but took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way,<br> without a word. He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on,<br> into a narrow lane at the rear.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XX. The Prince and the hermit.<br><br> The high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of<br> a deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the<br> distance. He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter<br> of the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance.<br> That was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but<br> hurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the<br> twilight depths of the wood. Then he stopped; being persuaded that he<br> was now tolerably safe. He listened intently, but the stillness was<br> profound and solemn--awful, even, and depressing to the spirits. At<br> wide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so<br> remote, and hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real<br> sounds, but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed<br> ones. So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they<br> interrupted.<br><br> It was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of<br> the day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at<br> last obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He struck straight<br> through the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was<br> disappointed in this. He travelled on and on; but the farther he went,<br> the denser the wood became, apparently. The gloom began to thicken,<br> by-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on. It made<br> him shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he<br> tried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could<br> not now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he<br> kept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers.<br><br> And how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light! He<br> approached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen. It<br> came from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut. He heard<br> a voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his<br> mind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently. He glided to the<br> one window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance<br> within. The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten<br> hard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or<br> two; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans;<br> there was a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the<br> remains of a faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was<br> lighted by a single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box<br> at his side lay an open book and a human skull. The man was of large,<br> bony frame; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he<br> was clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his<br> heels.<br><br> ‘A holy hermit!’ said the King to himself; ‘now am I indeed fortunate.’<br><br> The hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked. A deep voice<br> responded--<br><br> ‘Enter!--but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand<br> is holy!’<br><br> The King entered, and paused. The hermit turned a pair of gleaming,<br> unrestful eyes upon him, and said--<br><br> ‘Who art thou?’<br><br> ‘I am the King,’ came the answer, with placid simplicity.<br><br> ‘Welcome, King!’ cried the hermit, with enthusiasm. Then, bustling<br> about with feverish activity, and constantly saying, ‘Welcome, welcome,’<br> he arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some<br> faggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous<br> stride.<br><br> ‘Welcome! Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy,<br> and were turned away. But a King who casts his crown away, and despises<br> the vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to<br> devote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh--he is<br> worthy, he is welcome!--here shall he abide all his days till death<br> come.’ The King hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid<br> no attention to him--did not even hear him, apparently, but went right<br> on with his talk, with a raised voice and a growing energy. ‘And thou<br> shalt be at peace here. None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee<br> with supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God<br> hath moved thee to abandon. Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the<br> Book; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world,<br> and upon the sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon<br> crusts and herbs, and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the<br> purifying of thy soul. Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin;<br> thou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at<br> peace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he<br> shall not find thee, he shall not molest thee.’<br><br> The old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and<br> began to mutter. The King seized this opportunity to state his case;<br> and he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension.<br> But the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed. And still<br> muttering, he approached the King and said impressively--<br><br> ‘'Sh! I will tell you a secret!’ He bent down to impart it, but<br> checked himself, and assumed a listening attitude. After a moment<br> or two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and<br> peered around in the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his<br> face close down to the King's, and whispered--<br><br> ‘I am an archangel!’<br><br> The King started violently, and said to himself, ‘Would God I were with<br> the outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!’ His<br> apprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face. In<br> a low excited voice the hermit continued--<br><br> ‘I see you feel my atmosphere! There's awe in your face! None may<br> be in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very<br> atmosphere of heaven. I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an<br> eye. I was made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago,<br> by angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity. Their presence<br> filled this place with an intolerable brightness. And they knelt to me,<br> King! yes, they knelt to me! for I was greater than they. I have walked<br> in the courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs. Touch<br> my hand--be not afraid--touch it. There--now thou hast touched a hand<br> which has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob! For I have<br> walked in the golden courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!’ He<br> paused, to give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and<br> he started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, ‘Yes, I am an<br> archangel; _a mere archangel!_--I that might have been pope! It is<br> verily true. I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago;<br> ah, yes, I was to be pope!--and I _should_ have been pope, for Heaven<br> had said it--but the King dissolved my religious house, and I, poor<br> obscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my<br> mighty destiny!’ Here he began to mumble again, and beat his forehead in<br> futile rage, with his fist; now and then articulating a venomous curse,<br> and now and then a pathetic ‘Wherefore I am nought but an archangel--I<br> that should have been pope!’<br><br> So he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and<br> suffered. Then all at once the old man's frenzy departed, and he became<br> all gentleness. His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and<br> fell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the<br> King's heart completely. The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the<br> fire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions<br> with a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a<br> supper--chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the<br> lad's cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in<br> a little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were<br> changed to reverence and affection for the man.<br><br> This happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then,<br> after a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a<br> small adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother<br> might; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the<br> fire, and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way.<br> Presently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his<br> fingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his<br> mind. Apparently he was unsuccessful. Now he started quickly up, and<br> entered his guest's room, and said--<br><br> ‘Thou art King?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ was the response, drowsily uttered.<br><br> ‘What King?’<br><br> ‘Of England.’<br><br> ‘Of England? Then Henry is gone!’<br><br> ‘Alack, it is so. I am his son.’<br><br> A black frown settled down upon the hermit's face, and he clenched his<br> bony hands with a vindictive energy. He stood a few moments, breathing<br> fast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice--<br><br> ‘Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and<br> homeless?’<br><br> There was no response. The old man bent down and scanned the boy's<br> reposeful face and listened to his placid breathing. ‘He sleeps--sleeps<br> soundly;’ and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of<br> evil satisfaction. A smile flitted across the dreaming boy's features.<br> The hermit muttered, ‘So--his heart is happy;’ and he turned away. He<br> went stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something;<br> now and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around<br> and casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always<br> mumbling to himself. At last he found what he seemed to want--a rusty<br> old butcher knife and a whetstone. Then he crept to his place by the<br> fire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone,<br> still muttering, mumbling, ejaculating. The winds sighed around the<br> lonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the<br> distances. The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at<br> the old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt,<br> absorbed, and noted none of these things.<br><br> At long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and<br> nodded his head with satisfaction. ‘It grows sharper,’ he said; ‘yes,<br> it grows sharper.’<br><br> He took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on,<br> entertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in<br> articulate speech--<br><br> ‘His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us--and is gone down into the<br> eternal fires! Yes, down into the eternal fires! He escaped us--but it<br> was God's will, yes it was God's will, we must not repine. But he<br> hath not escaped the fires! No, he hath not escaped the fires, the<br> consuming, unpitying, remorseless fires--and _they_ are everlasting!’<br><br> And so he wrought, and still wrought--mumbling, chuckling a low rasping<br> chuckle at times--and at times breaking again into words--<br><br> ‘It was his father that did it all. I am but an archangel; but for him<br> I should be pope!’<br><br> The King stirred. The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and<br> went down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife<br> uplifted. The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but<br> there was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his<br> tranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more.<br><br> The hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and<br> scarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept<br> away, saying,--<br><br> ‘It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest<br> by accident someone be passing.’<br><br> He glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and<br> another one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling<br> he managed to tie the King's ankles together without waking him. Next<br> he essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them,<br> but the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was<br> ready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready<br> to despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment<br> they were bound. Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper's chin and<br> brought up over his head and tied fast--and so softly, so gradually,<br> and so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy<br> slept peacefully through it all without stirring.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXI. Hendon to the rescue.<br><br> The old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the<br> low bench. He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and<br> flickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving<br> eyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there,<br> heedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled<br> and chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as<br> a grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay<br> bound and helpless in his web.<br><br> After a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,--yet not seeing,<br> his mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,--observed, on a<br> sudden, that the boy's eyes were open! wide open and staring!--staring<br> up in frozen horror at the knife. The smile of a gratified devil crept<br> over the old man's face, and he said, without changing his attitude or<br> his occupation--<br><br> ‘Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?’<br><br> The boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced<br> a smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to<br> interpret as an affirmative answer to his question.<br><br> ‘Then pray again. Pray the prayer for the dying!’<br><br> A shudder shook the boy's frame, and his face blenched. Then he<br> struggled again to free himself--turning and twisting himself this way<br> and that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately--but uselessly--to<br> burst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him,<br> and nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time<br> to time, ‘The moments are precious, they are few and precious--pray the<br> prayer for the dying!’<br><br> The boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles,<br> panting. The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down<br> his face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the<br> savage old man.<br><br> The dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply,<br> with a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice--<br><br> ‘I may not indulge this ecstasy longer! The night is already gone. It<br> seems but a moment--only a moment; would it had endured a year! Seed of<br> the Church's spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an' thou fearest to look<br> upon--’<br><br> The rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. The old man sank upon his<br> knees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.<br><br> Hark! There was a sound of voices near the cabin--the knife dropped<br> from the hermit's hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up,<br> trembling. The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough<br> and angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift<br> footsteps, retreating. Immediately came a succession of thundering<br> knocks upon the cabin door, followed by--<br><br> ‘Hullo-o-o! Open! And despatch, in the name of all the devils!’<br><br> Oh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King's<br> ears; for it was Miles Hendon's voice!<br><br> The hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of<br> the bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King<br> heard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the 'chapel':--<br><br> ‘Homage and greeting, reverend sir! Where is the boy--_my_ boy?’<br><br> ‘What boy, friend?’<br><br> ‘What boy! Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!--I am not<br> in the humour for it. Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I<br> judged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was<br> at large again, and they had tracked him to your door. They showed me<br> his very footprints. Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an'<br> thou produce him not--Where is the boy?’<br><br> ‘O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried<br> here the night. If such as you take an interest in such as he, know,<br> then, that I have sent him of an errand. He will be back anon.’<br><br> ‘How soon? How soon? Come, waste not the time--cannot I overtake him?<br> How soon will he be back?’<br><br> ‘Thou need'st not stir; he will return quickly.’<br><br> ‘So be it, then. I will try to wait. But stop!--_you_ sent him of an<br> errand?--you! Verily this is a lie--he would not go. He would pull thy<br> old beard, an' thou didst offer him such an insolence. Thou hast lied,<br> friend; thou hast surely lied! He would not go for thee, nor for any<br> man.’<br><br> ‘For any _man_--no; haply not. But I am not a man.’<br><br> ‘_What_! Now o' God's name what art thou, then?’<br><br> ‘It is a secret--mark thou reveal it not. I am an archangel!’<br><br> There was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon--not altogether<br> unprofane--followed by--<br><br> ‘This doth well and truly account for his complaisance! Right well<br> I knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any<br> mortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the<br> word o' command! Let me--'sh! What noise was that?’<br><br> All this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with<br> terror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown<br> all the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly<br> expecting them to reach Hendon's ear, but always realising, with<br> bitterness, that they failed, or at least made no impression. So this<br> last remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh<br> fields to the dying; and he exerted himself once more, and with all his<br> energy, just as the hermit was saying--<br><br> ‘Noise? I heard only the wind.’<br><br> ‘Mayhap it was. Yes, doubtless that was it. I have been hearing it<br> faintly all the--there it is again! It is not the wind! What an odd<br> sound! Come, we will hunt it out!’<br><br> Now the King's joy was nearly insupportable. His tired lungs did<br> their utmost--and hopefully, too--but the sealed jaws and the muffling<br> sheepskin sadly crippled the effort. Then the poor fellow's heart sank,<br> to hear the hermit say--<br><br> ‘Ah, it came from without--I think from the copse yonder. Come, I will<br> lead the way.’<br><br> The King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die<br> quickly away--then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence.<br><br> It seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching<br> again--and this time he heard an added sound,--the trampling of hoofs,<br> apparently. Then he heard Hendon say--<br><br> ‘I will not wait longer. I _cannot_ wait longer. He has lost his way<br> in this thick wood. Which direction took he? Quick--point it out to<br> me.’<br><br> ‘He--but wait; I will go with thee.’<br><br> ‘Good--good! Why, truly thou art better than thy looks. Marry I do<br> not think there's not another archangel with so right a heart as thine.<br> Wilt ride? Wilt take the wee donkey that's for my boy, or wilt thou<br> fork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have<br> provided for myself?--and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the<br> indifferent sum of a month's usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker<br> out of work.’<br><br> ‘No--ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and<br> will walk.’<br><br> ‘Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my<br> hands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one.’<br><br> Then followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and plungings,<br> accompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses, and<br> finally a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must have broken its<br> spirit, for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment.<br><br> With unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and<br> footsteps fade away and die out. All hope forsook him, now, for the<br> moment, and a dull despair settled down upon his heart. ‘My only friend<br> is deceived and got rid of,’ he said; ‘the hermit will return and--’ He<br> finished with a gasp; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with<br> his bonds again, that he shook off the smothering sheepskin.<br><br> And now he heard the door open! The sound chilled him to the<br> marrow--already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat. Horror made<br> him close his eyes; horror made him open them again--and before him<br> stood John Canty and Hugo!<br><br> He would have said ‘Thank God!’ if his jaws had been free.<br><br> A moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his captors, each<br> gripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all speed through the<br> forest.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXII. A Victim of Treachery.<br><br> Once more 'King Foo-foo the First' was roving with the tramps and<br> outlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries, and<br> sometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and<br> Hugo when the Ruffler's back was turned. None but Canty and Hugo really<br> disliked him. Some of the others liked him, and all admired his pluck<br> and spirit. During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge<br> the King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable;<br> and at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by<br> putting small indignities upon him--always as if by accident. Twice he<br> stepped upon the King's toes--accidentally--and the King, as became his<br> royalty, was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it; but<br> the third time Hugo entertained himself in that way, the King felled<br> him to the ground with a cudgel, to the prodigious delight of the tribe.<br> Hugo, consumed with anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and<br> came at his small adversary in a fury. Instantly a ring was formed<br> around the gladiators, and the betting and cheering began.<br><br> But poor Hugo stood no chance whatever. His frantic and lubberly<br> 'prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against<br> an arm which had been trained by the first masters of Europe in<br> single-stick, quarter-staff, and every art and trick of swordsmanship.<br> The little King stood, alert but at graceful ease, and caught and<br> turned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which<br> set the motley on-lookers wild with admiration; and every now and then,<br> when his practised eye detected an opening, and a lightning-swift rap<br> upon Hugo's head followed as a result, the storm of cheers and laughter<br> that swept the place was something wonderful to hear. At the end of<br> fifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered, bruised, and the target for<br> a pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk from the field; and the<br> unscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the<br> shoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the<br> Ruffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the Game-Cocks;<br> his meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled,<br> and a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who<br> should thenceforth utter it.<br><br> All attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed. He<br> had stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always trying to escape.<br> He had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first day of his<br> return; he not only came forth empty-handed, but tried to rouse the<br> housemates. He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work;<br> he would not work; moreover, he threatened the tinker with his own<br> soldering-iron; and finally both Hugo and the tinker found their<br> hands full with the mere matter of keeping his from getting away. He<br> delivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered<br> his liberties or tried to force him to service. He was sent out, in<br> Hugo's charge, in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby,<br> to beg; but the result was not encouraging--he declined to plead for the<br> mendicants, or be a party to their cause in any way.<br><br> Thus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping life, and<br> the weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it, became<br> gradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at<br> last to feel that his release from the hermit's knife must prove only a<br> temporary respite from death, at best.<br><br> But at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he was<br> on his throne, and master again. This, of course, intensified the<br> sufferings of the awakening--so the mortifications of each succeeding<br> morning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the<br> combat with Hugo, grew bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to<br> bear.<br><br> The morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled with<br> vengeful purposes against the King. He had two plans, in particular.<br> One was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud spirit<br> and 'imagined' royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if he failed to<br> accomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the<br> King, and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law.<br><br> In pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a 'clime' upon the<br> King's leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and<br> perfect degree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he meant to get<br> Canty's help, and _force_ the King to expose his leg in the highway<br> and beg for alms. 'Clime' was the cant term for a sore, artificially<br> created. To make a clime, the operator made a paste or poultice of<br> unslaked lime, soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a<br> piece of leather, which was then bound tightly upon the leg. This would<br> presently fret off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking;<br> blood was then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a<br> dark and repulsive colour. Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in<br> a cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen,<br> and move the compassion of the passer-by. {8}<br><br> Hugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the<br> soldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon<br> as they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker<br> held him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg.<br><br> The King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the moment the<br> sceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip upon him<br> and enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats. This<br> continued until the poultice began to bite; and in no long time its work<br> would have been perfected, if there had been no interruption. But there<br> was; for about this time the 'slave' who had made the speech denouncing<br> England's laws, appeared on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise,<br> and stripped off the poultice and bandage.<br><br> The King wanted to borrow his deliverer's cudgel and warm the jackets<br> of the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it would bring<br> trouble--leave the matter till night; the whole tribe being together,<br> then, the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt. He<br> marched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler,<br> who listened, pondered, and then decided that the King should not be<br> again detailed to beg, since it was plain he was worthy of something<br> higher and better--wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the<br> mendicant rank and appointed him to steal!<br><br> Hugo was overjoyed. He had already tried to make the King steal, and<br> failed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort, now, for of<br> course the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered<br> directly from head-quarters. So he planned a raid for that very<br> afternoon, purposing to get the King in the law's grip in the course of<br> it; and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that it should seem<br> to be accidental and unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was<br> popular now, and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular<br> member who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him<br> over to the common enemy, the law.<br><br> Very well. All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village<br> with his prey; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after<br> another, the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil<br> purpose, and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and<br> get free of his infamous captivity for ever.<br><br> Both threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for both,<br> in their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure work this<br> time, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into<br> any venture that had much uncertainty about it.<br><br> Hugo's chance came first. For at last a woman approached who carried a<br> fat package of some sort in a basket. Hugo's eyes sparkled with sinful<br> pleasure as he said to himself, ‘Breath o' my life, an' I can but<br> put _that_ upon him, 'tis good-den and God keep thee, King of the<br> Game-Cocks!’ He waited and watched--outwardly patient, but inwardly<br> consuming with excitement--till the woman had passed by, and the time<br> was ripe; then said, in a low voice--<br><br> ‘Tarry here till I come again,’ and darted stealthily after the prey.<br><br> The King's heart was filled with joy--he could make his escape, now, if<br> Hugo's quest only carried him far enough away.<br><br> But he was to have no such luck. Hugo crept behind the woman, snatched<br> the package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of<br> blanket which he carried on his arm. The hue and cry was raised in a<br> moment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden,<br> although she had not seen the pilfering done. Hugo thrust the bundle<br> into the King's hands without halting, saying--<br><br> ‘Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry 'Stop thief!' but mind ye<br> lead them astray!’<br><br> The next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked<br> alley--and in another moment or two he lounged into view again, looking<br> innocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a post to watch<br> results.<br><br> The insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the blanket fell<br> away from it just as the woman arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her<br> heels; she seized the King's wrist with one hand, snatched up her bundle<br> with the other, and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy<br> while he struggled, without success, to free himself from her grip.<br><br> Hugo had seen enough--his enemy was captured and the law would get him,<br> now--so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended campwards,<br> framing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler's crew<br> as he strode along.<br><br> The King continued to struggle in the woman's strong grasp, and now and<br> then cried out in vexation--<br><br> ‘Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of<br> thy paltry goods.’<br><br> The crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a<br> brawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows,<br> made a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson;<br> but just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing<br> force upon the man's arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it<br> remarking pleasantly, at the same time--<br><br> ‘Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and<br> uncharitable words. This is matter for the law's consideration,<br> not private and unofficial handling. Loose thy hold from the boy,<br> goodwife.’<br><br> The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went<br> muttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy's wrist<br> reluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently<br> closed their mouths. The King sprang to his deliverer's side, with<br> flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming--<br><br> ‘Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir<br> Miles; carve me this rabble to rags!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIII. The Prince a prisoner.<br><br> Hendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King's<br> ear--<br><br> ‘Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily--nay, suffer it not to<br> wag at all. Trust in me--all shall go well in the end.’ Then he added<br> to himself: ‘_Sir_ Miles! Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a<br> knight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth<br> take upon his quaint and crazy fancies! . . . An empty and foolish title<br> is mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is<br> more honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of<br> Dreams and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of<br> the _real_ kingdoms of this world.’<br><br> The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about<br> to lay his hand upon the King's shoulder, when Hendon said--<br><br> ‘Gently, good friend, withhold your hand--he shall go peaceably; I am<br> responsible for that. Lead on, we will follow.’<br><br> The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King<br> followed after, with the crowd at their heels. The King was inclined to<br> rebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice--<br><br> ‘Reflect, Sire--your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty;<br> shall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect<br> them? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on<br> his throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was<br> seemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and<br> submitted to its authority?’<br><br> ‘Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King<br> of England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself<br> suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject.’<br><br> When the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the<br> peace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who<br> had committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so<br> the King stood convicted. The bundle was now unrolled, and when the<br> contents proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked<br> troubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an<br> electric shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected<br> by his ignorance. The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then<br> turned to the woman, with the question--<br><br> ‘What dost thou hold this property to be worth?’<br><br> The woman courtesied and replied--<br><br> ‘Three shillings and eightpence, your worship--I could not abate a penny<br> and set forth the value honestly.’<br><br> The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to<br> the constable, and said--<br><br> ‘Clear the court and close the doors.’<br><br> It was done. None remained but the two officials, the accused, the<br> accuser, and Miles Hendon. This latter was rigid and colourless, and<br> on his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended<br> together, and trickled down his face. The judge turned to the woman<br> again, and said, in a compassionate voice--<br><br> ‘'Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for<br> these be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an<br> evil face--but when hunger driveth--Good woman! dost know that when one<br> steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha'penny the law saith<br> he shall _hang_ for it?’<br><br> The little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled<br> himself and held his peace; but not so the woman. She sprang to her<br> feet, shaking with fright, and cried out--<br><br> ‘Oh, good lack, what have I done! God-a-mercy, I would not hang<br> the poor thing for the whole world! Ah, save me from this, your<br> worship--what shall I do, what _can_ I do?’<br><br> The justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said--<br><br> ‘Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ<br> upon the record.’<br><br> ‘Then in God's name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day<br> that freed my conscience of this awesome thing!’<br><br> Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King<br> and wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging<br> him. The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig;<br> and when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into<br> the narrow hall. The justice proceeded to write in his record book.<br> Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer<br> followed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and<br> listened. He heard a conversation to this effect--<br><br> ‘It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here<br> is the eightpence.’<br><br> ‘Eightpence, indeed! Thou'lt do no such thing. It cost me three<br> shillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old<br> Harry that's just dead ne'er touched or tampered with. A fig for thy<br> eightpence!’<br><br> ‘Stands the wind in that quarter? Thou wast under oath, and so swore<br> falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence. Come straightway<br> back with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!--and then the<br> lad will hang.’<br><br> ‘There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content. Give me the<br> eightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter.’<br><br> The woman went off crying: Hendon slipped back into the court room,<br> and the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some<br> convenient place. The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King<br> a wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment<br> in the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging. The astounded<br> King opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to<br> be beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and<br> succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it.<br> Hendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the<br> two departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail. The moment<br> the street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his<br> hand, and exclaimed--<br><br> ‘Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail _alive_?’<br><br> Hendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply--<br><br> ‘_Will_ you trust in me? Peace! and forbear to worsen our chances with<br> dangerous speech. What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it,<br> thou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient--'twill be time<br> enow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened.’ {1}<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIV. The Escape.<br><br> The short winter day was nearly ended. The streets were deserted, save<br> for a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the<br> intent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands<br> as quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising<br> wind and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to the right nor to<br> the left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem<br> to see them. Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his<br> way to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before.<br> By-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and<br> proceeded to cross it. When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon<br> laid his hand upon his arm, and said in a low voice--<br><br> ‘Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a<br> word to thee.’<br><br> ‘My duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on.’<br><br> ‘Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly. Turn thy back<br> a moment and seem not to see: _let this poor lad escape_.’<br><br> ‘This to me, sir! I arrest thee in--’<br><br> ‘Nay, be not too hasty. See thou be careful and commit no foolish<br> error,’--then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man's<br> ear--’the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck,<br> man!’<br><br> The poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then<br> found his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon<br> was tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then<br> said--<br><br> ‘I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee<br> come to harm. Observe, I heard it all--every word. I will prove it to<br> thee.’ Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman<br> had had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with--<br><br> ‘There--have I set it forth correctly? Should not I be able to set it<br> forth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?’<br><br> The man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied,<br> and said with forced lightness--<br><br> ‘'Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the<br> woman for mine amusement.’<br><br> ‘Kept you the woman's pig for amusement?’<br><br> The man answered sharply--<br><br> ‘Nought else, good sir--I tell thee 'twas but a jest.’<br><br> ‘I do begin to believe thee,’ said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of<br> mockery and half-conviction in his tone; ‘but tarry thou here a<br> moment whilst I run and ask his worship--for nathless, he being a man<br> experienced in law, in jests, in--’<br><br> He was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted,<br> spat out an oath or two, then cried out--<br><br> ‘Hold, hold, good sir--prithee wait a little--the judge! Why, man, he<br> hath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!--come, and we<br> will speak further. Ods body! I seem to be in evil case--and all for<br> an innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my<br> wife and little ones--List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst<br> thou of me?’<br><br> ‘Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a<br> hundred thousand--counting slowly,’ said Hendon, with the expression of<br> a man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one.<br><br> ‘It is my destruction!’ said the constable despairingly. ‘Ah, be<br> reasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and<br> see how mere a jest it is--how manifestly and how plainly it is so. And<br> even if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that<br> e'en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and<br> warning from the judge's lips.’<br><br> Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him--<br><br> ‘This jest of thine hath a name, in law,--wot you what it is?’<br><br> ‘I knew it not! Peradventure I have been unwise. I never dreamed it<br> had a name--ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original.’<br><br> ‘Yes, it hath a name. In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis<br> lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi.’<br><br> ‘Ah, my God!’<br><br> ‘And the penalty is death!’<br><br> ‘God be merciful to me a sinner!’<br><br> ‘By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy,<br> thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha'penny, paying but<br> a trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive<br> barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem<br> expurgatis in statu quo--and the penalty is death by the halter, without<br> ransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy.’<br><br> ‘Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me! Be thou<br> merciful--spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought<br> that shall happen.’<br><br> ‘Good! now thou'rt wise and reasonable. And thou'lt restore the pig?’<br><br> ‘I will, I will indeed--nor ever touch another, though heaven send it<br> and an archangel fetch it. Go--I am blind for thy sake--I see nothing.<br> I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by<br> force. It is but a crazy, ancient door--I will batter it down myself<br> betwixt midnight and the morning.’<br><br> ‘Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving<br> charity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer's<br> bones for his escape.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXV. Hendon Hall.<br><br> As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his<br> Majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and<br> wait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account.<br> Half an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on<br> Hendon's sorry steeds. The King was warm and comfortable, now, for<br> he had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which<br> Hendon had bought on London Bridge.<br><br> Hendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that<br> hard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be<br> bad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise<br> would be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken<br> intellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the<br> tormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages<br> toward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying<br> the impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day.<br><br> When he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a<br> considerable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn.<br> The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King's<br> chair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was<br> ready for bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept<br> athwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.<br><br> The next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking<br> over the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily<br> enjoying each other's narratives. Hendon detailed all his wide<br> wanderings in search of the King, and described how the archangel had<br> led him a fool's journey all over the forest, and taken him back to<br> the hut, finally, when he found he could not get rid of him. Then--he<br> said--the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back<br> looking broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy<br> had returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so. Hendon<br> had waited at the hut all day; hope of the King's return died out, then,<br> and he departed upon the quest again.<br><br> ‘And old Sanctum Sanctorum _was_ truly sorry your highness came not<br> back,’ said Hendon; ‘I saw it in his face.’<br><br> ‘Marry I will never doubt _that_!’ said the King--and then told his own<br> story; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.<br><br> During the last day of the trip, Hendon's spirits were soaring. His<br> tongue ran constantly. He talked about his old father, and his brother<br> Arthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and<br> generous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith,<br> and was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and<br> brotherly things about Hugh. He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting<br> at Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody, and what an<br> outburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.<br><br> It was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road<br> led through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with<br> gentle elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding<br> undulations of the sea. In the afternoon the returning prodigal made<br> constant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock<br> he might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home. At<br> last he was successful, and cried out excitedly--<br><br> ‘There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You<br> may see the towers from here; and that wood there--that is my father's<br> park. Ah, _now_ thou'lt know what state and grandeur be! A house with<br> seventy rooms--think of that!--and seven and twenty servants! A brave<br> lodging for such as we, is it not so? Come, let us speed--my impatience<br> will not brook further delay.’<br><br> All possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o'clock before<br> the village was reached. The travellers scampered through it, Hendon's<br> tongue going all the time. ‘Here is the church--covered with the same<br> ivy--none gone, none added.’ ‘Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,--and<br> yonder is the market-place.’ ‘Here is the Maypole, and here the<br> pump--nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years<br> make a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know<br> me.’ So his chat ran on. The end of the village was soon reached; then<br> the travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall<br> hedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a<br> vast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars<br> bore sculptured armorial devices. A noble mansion was before them.<br><br> ‘Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!’ exclaimed Miles. ‘Ah, 'tis a great<br> day! My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with<br> joy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first<br> transports of the meeting, and so thou'lt seem but coldly welcomed--but<br> mind it not; 'twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my<br> ward, and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou'lt see them<br> take thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon's sake, and make their house<br> and hearts thy home for ever after!’<br><br> The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door,<br> helped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within. A few<br> steps brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King<br> with more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a<br> writing-table in front of a generous fire of logs.<br><br> ‘Embrace me, Hugh,’ he cried, ‘and say thou'rt glad I am come again! and<br> call our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and<br> see his face, and hear his voice once more!’<br><br> But Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent<br> a grave stare upon the intruder--a stare which indicated somewhat of<br> offended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward<br> thought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with<br> a real or assumed compassion. Presently he said, in a mild voice--<br><br> ‘Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered<br> privations and rude buffetings at the world's hands; thy looks and dress<br> betoken it. Whom dost thou take me to be?’<br><br> ‘Take thee? Prithee for whom else than whom thou art? I take thee to<br> be Hugh Hendon,’ said Miles, sharply.<br><br> The other continued, in the same soft tone--<br><br> ‘And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?’<br><br> ‘Imagination hath nought to do with it! Dost thou pretend thou knowest<br> me not for thy brother Miles Hendon?’<br><br> An expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh's face, and he<br> exclaimed--<br><br> ‘What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life? God be praised<br> if it be so! Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these<br> cruel years! Ah, it seems too good to be true, it _is_ too good to be<br> true--I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me! Quick--come to<br> the light--let me scan thee well!’<br><br> He seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to<br> devour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and<br> that, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him<br> from all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with<br> gladness, smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying--<br><br> ‘Go on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou'lt find nor limb nor feature<br> that cannot bide the test. Scour and scan me to thy content, my good<br> old Hugh--I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same old Miles, thy lost<br> brother, is't not so? Ah, 'tis a great day--I _said_ 'twas a great day!<br> Give me thy hand, give me thy cheek--lord, I am like to die of very<br> joy!’<br><br> He was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand<br> in dissent, then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying<br> with emotion--<br><br> ‘Ah, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous<br> disappointment!’<br><br> Miles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue,<br> and cried out--<br><br> ‘_What_ disappointment? Am I not thy brother?’<br><br> Hugh shook his head sadly, and said--<br><br> ‘I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the<br> resemblances that are hid from mine. Alack, I fear me the letter spoke<br> but too truly.’<br><br> ‘What letter?’<br><br> ‘One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago. It said my<br> brother died in battle.’<br><br> ‘It was a lie! Call thy father--he will know me.’<br><br> ‘One may not call the dead.’<br><br> ‘Dead?’ Miles's voice was subdued, and his lips trembled. ‘My father<br> dead!--oh, this is heavy news. Half my new joy is withered now.<br> Prithee let me see my brother Arthur--he will know me; he will know me<br> and console me.’<br><br> ‘He, also, is dead.’<br><br> ‘God be merciful to me, a stricken man! Gone,--both gone--the worthy<br> taken and the worthless spared, in me! Ah! I crave your mercy!--do not<br> say the Lady Edith--’<br><br> ‘Is dead? No, she lives.’<br><br> ‘Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again! Speed thee, brother--let<br> her come to me! An' _she_ say I am not myself--but she will not; no,<br> no, _she_ will know me, I were a fool to doubt it. Bring her--bring the<br> old servants; they, too, will know me.’<br><br> ‘All are gone but five--Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret.’<br><br> So saying, Hugh left the room. Miles stood musing a while, then began<br> to walk the floor, muttering--<br><br> ‘The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and<br> honest--'tis an odd thing.’<br><br> He continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had<br> forgotten the King entirely. By-and-by his Majesty said gravely, and<br> with a touch of genuine compassion, though the words themselves were<br> capable of being interpreted ironically--<br><br> ‘Mind not thy mischance, good man; there be others in the world whose<br> identity is denied, and whose claims are derided. Thou hast company.’<br><br> ‘Ah, my King,’ cried Hendon, colouring slightly, ‘do not thou condemn<br> me--wait, and thou shalt see. I am no impostor--she will say it; you<br> shall hear it from the sweetest lips in England. I an impostor? Why, I<br> know this old hall, these pictures of my ancestors, and all these things<br> that are about us, as a child knoweth its own nursery. Here was I born<br> and bred, my lord; I speak the truth; I would not deceive thee; and<br> should none else believe, I pray thee do not _thou_ doubt me--I could<br> not bear it.’<br><br> ‘I do not doubt thee,’ said the King, with a childlike simplicity and<br> faith.<br><br> ‘I thank thee out of my heart!’ exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which<br> showed that he was touched. The King added, with the same gentle<br> simplicity--<br><br> ‘Dost thou doubt _me_?’<br><br> A guilty confusion seized upon Hendon, and he was grateful that the door<br> opened to admit Hugh, at that moment, and saved him the necessity of<br> replying.<br><br> A beautiful lady, richly clothed, followed Hugh, and after her came<br> several liveried servants. The lady walked slowly, with her head bowed<br> and her eyes fixed upon the floor. The face was unspeakably sad. Miles<br> Hendon sprang forward, crying out--<br><br> ‘Oh, my Edith, my darling--’<br><br> But Hugh waved him back, gravely, and said to the lady--<br><br> ‘Look upon him. Do you know him?’<br><br> At the sound of Miles's voice the woman had started slightly, and her<br> cheeks had flushed; she was trembling now. She stood still, during an<br> impressive pause of several moments; then slowly lifted up her head and<br> looked into Hendon's eyes with a stony and frightened gaze; the blood<br> sank out of her face, drop by drop, till nothing remained but the grey<br> pallor of death; then she said, in a voice as dead as the face, ‘I know<br> him not!’ and turned, with a moan and a stifled sob, and tottered out of<br> the room.<br><br> Miles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.<br> After a pause, his brother said to the servants--<br><br> ‘You have observed him. Do you know him?’<br><br> They shook their heads; then the master said--<br><br> ‘The servants know you not, sir. I fear there is some mistake. You have<br> seen that my wife knew you not.’<br><br> ‘Thy _wife_!’ In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron<br> grip about his throat. ‘Oh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all!<br> Thou'st writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen bride and goods<br> are its fruit. There--now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable<br> soldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!’<br><br> Hugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and<br> commanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger. They<br> hesitated, and one of them said--<br><br> ‘He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless.’<br><br> ‘Armed! What of it, and ye so many? Upon him, I say!’<br><br> But Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added--<br><br> ‘Ye know me of old--I have not changed; come on, an' it like you.’<br><br> This reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back.<br><br> ‘Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors,<br> whilst I send one to fetch the watch!’ said Hugh. He turned at the<br> threshold, and said to Miles, ‘You'll find it to your advantage to<br> offend not with useless endeavours at escape.’<br><br> ‘Escape? Spare thyself discomfort, an' that is all that troubles thee.<br> For Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings. He<br> will remain--doubt it not.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVI. Disowned.<br><br> The King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said--<br><br> ‘'Tis strange--most strange. I cannot account for it.’<br><br> ‘No, it is not strange, my liege. I know him, and this conduct is but<br> natural. He was a rascal from his birth.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I spake not of _him_, Sir Miles.’<br><br> ‘Not of him? Then of what? What is it that is strange?’<br><br> ‘That the King is not missed.’<br><br> ‘How? Which? I doubt I do not understand.’<br><br> ‘Indeed? Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land<br> is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and<br> making search for me? Is it no matter for commotion and distress that<br> the Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?’<br><br> ‘Most true, my King, I had forgot.’ Then Hendon sighed, and muttered to<br> himself, ‘Poor ruined mind--still busy with its pathetic dream.’<br><br> ‘But I have a plan that shall right us both--I will write a paper, in<br> three tongues--Latin, Greek and English--and thou shalt haste away with<br> it to London in the morning. Give it to none but my uncle, the Lord<br> Hertford; when he shall see it, he will know and say I wrote it. Then<br> he will send for me.’<br><br> ‘Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself<br> and make my rights secure to my domains? I should be so much the better<br> able then to--’<br><br> The King interrupted him imperiously--<br><br> ‘Peace! What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted<br> with matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a<br> throne?’ Then, he added, in a gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his<br> severity, ‘Obey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee<br> whole--yes, more than whole. I shall remember, and requite.’<br><br> So saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work. Hendon<br> contemplated him lovingly a while, then said to himself--<br><br> ‘An' it were dark, I should think it _was_ a king that spoke; there's<br> no denying it, when the humour's upon on him he doth thunder and lighten<br> like your true King; now where got he that trick? See him scribble and<br> scratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to<br> be Latin and Greek--and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device<br> for diverting him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post<br> away to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me.’<br><br> The next moment Sir Miles's thoughts had gone back to the recent<br> episode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently<br> handed him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and<br> pocketed it without being conscious of the act. ‘How marvellous strange<br> she acted,’ he muttered. ‘I think she knew me--and I think she did<br> _not_ know me. These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I<br> cannot reconcile them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the<br> two, or even persuade one to outweigh the other. The matter standeth<br> simply thus: she _must_ have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how<br> could it be otherwise? Yet she __said_ _she knew me not, and that is<br> proof perfect, for she cannot lie. But stop--I think I begin to see.<br> Peradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to<br> lie. That is the solution. The riddle is unriddled. She seemed dead<br> with fear--yes, she was under his compulsion. I will seek her; I will<br> find her; now that he is away, she will speak her true mind. She will<br> remember the old times when we were little playfellows together, and<br> this will soften her heart, and she will no more betray me, but will<br> confess me. There is no treacherous blood in her--no, she was always<br> honest and true. She has loved me, in those old days--this is my<br> security; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray.’<br><br> He stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened, and the<br> Lady Edith entered. She was very pale, but she walked with a firm step,<br> and her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity. Her face was as<br> sad as before.<br><br> Miles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but she<br> checked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped where he<br> was. She seated herself, and asked him to do likewise. Thus simply did<br> she take the sense of old comradeship out of him, and transform him<br> into a stranger and a guest. The surprise of it, the bewildering<br> unexpectedness of it, made him begin to question, for a moment, if he<br> _was_ the person he was pretending to be, after all. The Lady Edith<br> said--<br><br> ‘Sir, I have come to warn you. The mad cannot be persuaded out of<br> their delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid<br> perils. I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to<br> you, and therefore is not criminal--but do not tarry here with it; for<br> here it is dangerous.’ She looked steadily into Miles's face a moment,<br> then added, impressively, ‘It is the more dangerous for that you _are_<br> much like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived.’<br><br> ‘Heavens, madam, but I _am_ he!’<br><br> ‘I truly think you think it, sir. I question not your honesty in that;<br> I but warn you, that is all. My husband is master in this region; his<br> power hath hardly any limit; the people prosper or starve, as he wills.<br> If you resembled not the man whom you profess to be, my husband might<br> bid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace; but trust me, I know<br> him well; I know what he will do; he will say to all that you are but a<br> mad impostor, and straightway all will echo him.’ She bent upon Miles<br> that same steady look once more, and added: ‘If you _were_ Miles<br> Hendon, and he knew it and all the region knew it--consider what I<br> am saying, weigh it well--you would stand in the same peril, your<br> punishment would be no less sure; he would deny you and denounce you,<br> and none would be bold enough to give you countenance.’<br><br> ‘Most truly I believe it,’ said Miles, bitterly. ‘The power that<br> can command one life-long friend to betray and disown another, and be<br> obeyed, may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are<br> on the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned.’<br><br> A faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady's cheek, and she dropped<br> her eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she<br> proceeded--<br><br> ‘I have warned you--I must still warn you--to go hence. This man will<br> destroy you, else. He is a tyrant who knows no pity. I, who am<br> his fettered slave, know this. Poor Miles, and Arthur, and my dear<br> guardian, Sir Richard, are free of him, and at rest: better that<br> you were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this<br> miscreant. Your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions;<br> you have assaulted him in his own house: you are ruined if you stay.<br> Go--do not hesitate. If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you,<br> and bribe the servants to let you pass. Oh, be warned, poor soul, and<br> escape while you may.’<br><br> Miles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before<br> her.<br><br> ‘Grant me one thing,’ he said. ‘Let your eyes rest upon mine, so that I<br> may see if they be steady. There--now answer me. Am I Miles Hendon?’<br><br> ‘No. I know you not.’<br><br> ‘Swear it!’<br><br> The answer was low, but distinct--<br><br> ‘I swear.’<br><br> ‘Oh, this passes belief!’<br><br> ‘Fly! Why will you waste the precious time? Fly, and save yourself.’<br><br> At that moment the officers burst into the room, and a violent struggle<br> began; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away. The King was<br> taken also, and both were bound and led to prison.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVII. In Prison.<br><br> The cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a large<br> room where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept.<br> They had company, for there were some twenty manacled and fettered<br> prisoners here, of both sexes and of varying ages,--an obscene and noisy<br> gang. The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put<br> upon his royalty, but Hendon was moody and taciturn. He was pretty<br> thoroughly bewildered; he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting<br> to find everybody wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the<br> cold shoulder and a jail. The promise and the fulfilment differed so<br> widely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it<br> was most tragic or most grotesque. He felt much as a man might who had<br> danced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got struck by lightning.<br><br> But gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into<br> some sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon Edith. He<br> turned her conduct over, and examined it in all lights, but he could not<br> make anything satisfactory out of it. Did she know him--or didn't she<br> know him? It was a perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but<br> he ended, finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had<br> repudiated him for interested reasons. He wanted to load her name with<br> curses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found<br> he could not bring his tongue to profane it.<br><br> Wrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon<br> and the King passed a troubled night. For a bribe the jailer had<br> furnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs,<br> fighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence. At last,<br> a while after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by<br> beating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could<br> come to the rescue. The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound<br> clubbing about the head and shoulders--then the carousing ceased;<br> and after that, all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the<br> annoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.<br><br> During the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous<br> sameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less<br> distinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the 'impostor' and repudiate<br> and insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with<br> symmetrical regularity. However, there was a change of incident at<br> last. The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him--<br><br> ‘The villain is in this room--cast thy old eyes about and see if thou<br> canst say which is he.’<br><br> Hendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first<br> time since he had been in the jail. He said to himself, ‘This is Blake<br> Andrews, a servant all his life in my father's family--a good honest<br> soul, with a right heart in his breast. That is, formerly. But none are<br> true now; all are liars. This man will know me--and will deny me, too,<br> like the rest.’<br><br> The old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and<br> finally said--<br><br> ‘I see none here but paltry knaves, scum o' the streets. Which is he?’<br><br> The jailer laughed.<br><br> ‘Here,’ he said; ‘scan this big animal, and grant me an opinion.’<br><br> The old man approached, and looked Hendon over, long and earnestly, then<br> shook his head and said--<br><br> ‘Marry, _this_ is no Hendon--nor ever was!’<br><br> ‘Right! Thy old eyes are sound yet. An' I were Sir Hugh, I would take<br> the shabby carle and--’<br><br> The jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary<br> halter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat<br> suggestive of suffocation. The old man said, vindictively--<br><br> ‘Let him bless God an' he fare no worse. An' _I_ had the handling o'<br> the villain he should roast, or I am no true man!’<br><br> The jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh, and said--<br><br> ‘Give him a piece of thy mind, old man--they all do it. Thou'lt find it<br> good diversion.’<br><br> Then he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared. The old man<br> dropped upon his knees and whispered--<br><br> ‘God be thanked, thou'rt come again, my master! I believed thou wert<br> dead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive! I knew thee the<br> moment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance<br> and seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o' the<br> streets. I am old and poor, Sir Miles; but say the word and I will go<br> forth and proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it.’<br><br> ‘No,’ said Hendon; ‘thou shalt not. It would ruin thee, and yet help<br> but little in my cause. But I thank thee, for thou hast given me back<br> somewhat of my lost faith in my kind.’<br><br> The old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for<br> he dropped in several times a day to 'abuse' the former, and always<br> smuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare; he<br> also furnished the current news. Hendon reserved the dainties for the<br> King; without them his Majesty might not have survived, for he was<br> not able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer.<br> Andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits, in order to<br> avoid suspicion; but he managed to impart a fair degree of information<br> each time--information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon's benefit,<br> and interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for<br> the benefit of other hearers.<br><br> So, little by little, the story of the family came out. Arthur had<br> been dead six years. This loss, with the absence of news from Hendon,<br> impaired the father's health; he believed he was going to die, and he<br> wished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away; but<br> Edith begged hard for delay, hoping for Miles's return; then the letter<br> came which brought the news of Miles's death; the shock prostrated Sir<br> Richard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh insisted<br> upon the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month's respite,<br> then another, and finally a third; the marriage then took place by<br> the death-bed of Sir Richard. It had not proved a happy one. It was<br> whispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride<br> found among her husband's papers several rough and incomplete drafts of<br> the fatal letter, and had accused him of precipitating the marriage--and<br> Sir Richard's death, too--by a wicked forgery. Tales of cruelty to the<br> Lady Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the<br> father's death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become<br> a pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his<br> domains for bread.<br><br> There was a bit of Andrew's gossip which the King listened to with a<br> lively interest--<br><br> ‘There is rumour that the King is mad. But in charity forbear to say<br> _I_ mentioned it, for 'tis death to speak of it, they say.’<br><br> His Majesty glared at the old man and said--<br><br> ‘The King is _not_ mad, good man--and thou'lt find it to thy advantage<br> to busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this<br> seditious prattle.’<br><br> ‘What doth the lad mean?’ said Andrews, surprised at this brisk assault<br> from such an unexpected quarter. Hendon gave him a sign, and he did not<br> pursue his question, but went on with his budget--<br><br> ‘The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two--the 16th of<br> the month--and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th.’<br><br> ‘Methinks they must needs find him first,’ muttered his Majesty; then<br> added, confidently, ‘but they will look to that--and so also shall I.’<br><br> ‘In the name of--’<br><br> But the old man got no further--a warning sign from Hendon checked his<br> remark. He resumed the thread of his gossip--<br><br> ‘Sir Hugh goeth to the coronation--and with grand hopes. He confidently<br> looketh to come back a peer, for he is high in favour with the Lord<br> Protector.’<br><br> ‘What Lord Protector?’ asked his Majesty.<br><br> ‘His Grace the Duke of Somerset.’<br><br> ‘What Duke of Somerset?’<br><br> ‘Marry, there is but one--Seymour, Earl of Hertford.’<br><br> The King asked sharply--<br><br> ‘Since when is _he_ a duke, and Lord Protector?’<br><br> ‘Since the last day of January.’<br><br> ‘And prithee who made him so?’<br><br> ‘Himself and the Great Council--with help of the King.’<br><br> His Majesty started violently. ‘The _King_!’ he cried. ‘_What_ king,<br> good sir?’<br><br> ‘What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?) Sith we have<br> but one, 'tis not difficult to answer--his most sacred Majesty King<br> Edward the Sixth--whom God preserve! Yea, and a dear and gracious<br> little urchin is he, too; and whether he be mad or no--and they say he<br> mendeth daily--his praises are on all men's lips; and all bless him,<br> likewise, and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in<br> England; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk's<br> life, and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that<br> harry and oppress the people.’<br><br> This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into<br> so deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man's<br> gossip. He wondered if the 'little urchin' was the beggar-boy whom<br> he left dressed in his own garments in the palace. It did not seem<br> possible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would<br> betray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales--then he would be<br> driven out, and search made for the true prince. Could it be that the<br> Court had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place? No, for his<br> uncle would not allow that--he was all-powerful and could and would<br> crush such a movement, of course. The boy's musings profited him<br> nothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he<br> became, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. His<br> impatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost<br> unendurable.<br><br> Hendon's arts all failed with the King--he could not be comforted; but a<br> couple of women who were chained near him succeeded better. Under their<br> gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience.<br> He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in<br> the sweet and soothing influence of their presence. He asked them why<br> they were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled,<br> and inquired--<br><br> ‘Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? Now I grieve, for I<br> shall lose ye--they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.’<br><br> They did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He<br> said, eagerly--<br><br> ‘You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me--there will be no other<br> punishment? Prithee tell me there is no fear of that.’<br><br> They tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he<br> pursued it--<br><br> ‘Will they scourge thee? No, no, they would not be so cruel! Say they<br> would not. Come, they _will_ not, will they?’<br><br> The women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an<br> answer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion--<br><br> ‘Oh, thou'lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!--God will help us to<br> bear our--’<br><br> ‘It is a confession!’ the King broke in. ‘Then they _will_ scourge<br> thee, the stony-hearted wretches! But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot<br> bear it. Keep up thy courage--I shall come to my own in time to save<br> thee from this bitter thing, and I will do it!’<br><br> When the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.<br><br> ‘They are saved!’ he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, ‘but woe<br> is me!--for they were my comforters.’<br><br> Each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token<br> of remembrance. He said he would keep these things always; and that<br> soon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them<br> under his protection.<br><br> Just then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and commanded that<br> the prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard. The King was overjoyed--it<br> would be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air<br> once more. He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but<br> his turn came at last, and he was released from his staple and ordered<br> to follow the other prisoners with Hendon.<br><br> The court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky. The<br> prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were<br> placed in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope<br> was stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their<br> officers. It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which<br> had fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added<br> to the general dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind<br> shivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.<br><br> In the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts. A glance<br> showed the King that these were his good friends. He shuddered, and<br> said to himself, ‘Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought. To<br> think that such as these should know the lash!--in England! Ay, there's<br> the shame of it--not in Heathennesse, Christian England! They will be<br> scourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must<br> look on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that<br> I, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect<br> them. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a<br> day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.<br> For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then.’<br><br> A great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in. They<br> flocked around the two women, and hid them from the King's view. A<br> clergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden.<br> The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being<br> asked and answered, but he could not make out what was said. Next there<br> was a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of<br> officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side<br> of the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon<br> the people.<br><br> Now, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a<br> spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. Faggots had been piled<br> about the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!<br><br> The women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;<br> the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling<br> faggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the<br> clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer--just then two young girls<br> came flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw<br> themselves upon the women at the stake. Instantly they were torn away<br> by the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other<br> broke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could<br> be stopped she had flung her arms about her mother's neck again. She<br> was torn away once more, and with her gown on fire. Two or three men<br> held her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and<br> thrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and<br> saying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed<br> to die with her mother. Both the girls screamed continually, and fought<br> for freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of<br> heart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony--the King glanced from the<br> frantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face<br> against the wall, and looked no more. He said, ‘That which I have seen,<br> in that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will<br> abide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the<br> nights, till I die. Would God I had been blind!’<br><br> Hendon was watching the King. He said to himself, with satisfaction,<br> ‘His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler. If he had<br> followed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he<br> was King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed. Soon<br> his delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be<br> whole again. God speed the day!’<br><br> That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night,<br> who were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom,<br> to undergo punishment for crimes committed. The King conversed with<br> these--he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself<br> for the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity<br> offered--and the tale of their woes wrung his heart. One of them was<br> a poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a<br> weaver--she was to be hanged for it. Another was a man who had been<br> accused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had<br> imagined that he was safe from the halter; but no--he was hardly free<br> before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King's park; this was<br> proved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows. There was<br> a tradesman's apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King;<br> this youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its<br> owner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it;<br> but the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.<br><br> The King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break<br> jail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne<br> and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and<br> save their lives. ‘Poor child,’ sighed Hendon, ‘these woeful tales<br> have brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he<br> would have been well in a little time.’<br><br> Among these prisoners was an old lawyer--a man with a strong face and a<br> dauntless mien. Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the<br> Lord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for<br> it by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the<br> bar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to<br> imprisonment for life. Lately he had repeated his offence; and in<br> consequence was now under sentence to lose _what remained of his ears_,<br> pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in<br> prison for life.<br><br> ‘These be honourable scars,’ he said, and turned back his grey hair and<br> showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.<br><br> The King's eye burned with passion. He said--<br><br> ‘None believe in me--neither wilt thou. But no matter--within the<br> compass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have<br> dishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the<br> statute books. The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to<br> their own laws, at times, and so learn mercy.’ {1}<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVIII. The sacrifice.<br><br> Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and<br> inaction. But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and<br> he thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment<br> should not be a part of it. But he was mistaken about that. He was in<br> a fine fury when he found himself described as a 'sturdy vagabond' and<br> sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character<br> and for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall. His pretensions as to<br> brothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon<br> honours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not<br> even worth examination.<br><br> He raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he<br> was snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff,<br> besides, for his irreverent conduct.<br><br> The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so<br> he was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and<br> servant. The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for<br> being in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a<br> warning, in consideration of his youth. When the crowd at last halted,<br> he flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting<br> a place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and<br> delay, succeeded. There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks,<br> the sport and butt of a dirty mob--he, the body servant of the King<br> of England! Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not<br> realised the half that it meant. His anger began to rise as the sense<br> of this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped<br> to summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air<br> and crush itself against Hendon's cheek, and heard the crowd roar<br> its enjoyment of the episode. He sprang across the open circle and<br> confronted the officer in charge, crying--<br><br> ‘For shame! This is my servant--set him free! I am the--’<br><br> ‘Oh, peace!’ exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, ‘thou'lt destroy thyself.<br> Mind him not, officer, he is mad.’<br><br> ‘Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I<br> have small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that<br> I am well inclined.’ He turned to a subordinate and said, ‘Give the<br> little fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners.’<br><br> ‘Half a dozen will better serve his turn,’ suggested Sir Hugh, who had<br> ridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings.<br><br> The King was seized. He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he<br> with the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be<br> inflicted upon his sacred person. History was already defiled with<br> the record of the scourging of an English king with whips--it was an<br> intolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful<br> page. He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either<br> take this punishment or beg for its remission. Hard conditions; he<br> would take the stripes--a king might do that, but a king could not beg.<br><br> But meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty. ‘Let the child<br> go,’ said he; ‘ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he<br> is? Let him go--I will take his lashes.’<br><br> ‘Marry, a good thought--and thanks for it,’ said Sir Hugh, his face<br> lighting with a sardonic satisfaction. ‘Let the little beggar go, and<br> give this fellow a dozen in his place--an honest dozen, well laid on.’<br> The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh<br> silenced him with the potent remark, ‘Yes, speak up, do, and free thy<br> mind--only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six<br> strokes the more.’<br><br> Hendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst<br> the lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and<br> allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked. ‘Ah, brave good<br> heart,’ he said to himself, ‘this loyal deed shall never perish out of<br> my memory. I will not forget it--and neither shall _they_!’ he added,<br> with passion. Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon's magnanimous<br> conduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and<br> so also did his gratefulness for it. Presently he said to himself, ‘Who<br> saves his prince from wounds and possible death--and this he did for<br> me--performs high service; but it is little--it is nothing--oh, less<br> than nothing!--when 'tis weighed against the act of him who saves his<br> prince from _shame_!’<br><br> Hendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with<br> soldierly fortitude. This, together with his redeeming the boy by<br> taking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn<br> and degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings<br> died away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows.<br> The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once<br> more in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour<br> which had prevailed there so little a while before. The King came<br> softly to Hendon's side, and whispered in his ear--<br><br> ‘Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher<br> than kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility<br> to men.’ He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon's<br> bleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, ‘Edward of England<br> dubs thee Earl!’<br><br> Hendon was touched. The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time<br> the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his<br> gravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward<br> mirth from showing outside. To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory,<br> from the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of<br> an Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the<br> grotesque. He said to himself, ‘Now am I finely tinselled, indeed!<br> The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a<br> spectre-earl--a dizzy flight for a callow wing! An' this go on, I<br> shall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and<br> make-believe honours. But I shall value them, all valueless as<br> they are, for the love that doth bestow them. Better these poor mock<br> dignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right<br> spirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested<br> power.’<br><br> The dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away,<br> the living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed<br> together again. And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture<br> a remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no<br> matter--the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself. A<br> late comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who<br> delivered a sneer at the 'impostor,' and was in the act of following it<br> with a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any<br> words, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIX. To London.<br><br> When Hendon's term of service in the stocks was finished, he was<br> released and ordered to quit the region and come back no more. His sword<br> was restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey. He mounted<br> and rode off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with quiet<br> respectfulness to let them pass, and then dispersing when they were<br> gone.<br><br> Hendon was soon absorbed in thought. There were questions of high<br> import to be answered. What should he do? Whither should he go?<br> Powerful help must be found somewhere, or he must relinquish his<br> inheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor<br> besides. Where could he hope to find this powerful help? Where,<br> indeed! It was a knotty question. By-and-by a thought occurred to him<br> which pointed to a possibility--the slenderest of slender possibilities,<br> certainly, but still worth considering, for lack of any other that<br> promised anything at all. He remembered what old Andrews had said about<br> the young King's goodness and his generous championship of the wronged<br> and unfortunate. Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for<br> justice? Ah, yes, but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the<br> august presence of a monarch? Never mind--let that matter take care of<br> itself; it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should<br> come to it. He was an old campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and<br> expedients: no doubt he would be able to find a way. Yes, he would<br> strike for the capital. Maybe his father's old friend Sir Humphrey<br> Marlow would help him--'good old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the<br> late King's kitchen, or stables, or something'--Miles could not remember<br> just what or which. Now that he had something to turn his energies to,<br> a distinctly defined object to accomplish, the fog of humiliation and<br> depression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away,<br> and he raised his head and looked about him. He was surprised to see<br> how far he had come; the village was away behind him. The King was<br> jogging along in his wake, with his head bowed; for he, too, was deep<br> in plans and thinkings. A sorrowful misgiving clouded Hendon's new-born<br> cheerfulness: would the boy be willing to go again to a city where,<br> during all his brief life, he had never known anything but ill-usage and<br> pinching want? But the question must be asked; it could not be avoided;<br> so Hendon reined up, and called out--<br><br> ‘I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound. Thy commands, my<br> liege!’<br><br> ‘To London!’<br><br> Hendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer--but astounded<br> at it too.<br><br> The whole journey was made without an adventure of importance. But it<br> ended with one. About ten o'clock on the night of the 19th of February<br> they stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling<br> jam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out<br> strongly in the glare from manifold torches--and at that instant the<br> decaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between<br> them, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the<br> hurrying confusion of feet. So evanescent and unstable are men's works<br> in this world!--the late good King is but three weeks dead and three<br> days in his grave, and already the adornments which he took such pains<br> to select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling. A<br> citizen stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of<br> somebody in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first person<br> that came handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that person's<br> friend. It was the right ripe time for a free fight, for the<br> festivities of the morrow--Coronation Day--were already beginning;<br> everybody was full of strong drink and patriotism; within five minutes<br> the free fight was occupying a good deal of ground; within ten or twelve<br> it covered an acre of so, and was become a riot. By this time Hendon<br> and the King were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the<br> rush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity. And so we leave<br> them.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXX. Tom's progress.<br><br> Whilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly<br> fed, cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves<br> and murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by<br> all impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different<br> experience.<br><br> When we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side<br> for him. This bright side went on brightening more and more every<br> day: in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and<br> delightfulness. He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died;<br> his embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident<br> bearing. He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.<br><br> He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence<br> when he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with<br> them, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances.<br> It no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand<br> at parting.<br><br> He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed<br> with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. It came to be a<br> proud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession<br> of officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he<br> doubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. He<br> liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the<br> distant voices responding, ‘Way for the King!’<br><br> He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and<br> seeming to be something more than the Lord Protector's mouthpiece. He<br> liked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen<br> to the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who<br> called him brother. O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!<br><br> He enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: he found his four<br> hundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them. The<br> adulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears. He<br> remained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all<br> that were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: yet<br> upon occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a<br> duke, and give him a look that would make him tremble. Once, when his<br> royal 'sister,' the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with<br> him against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who<br> would otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that<br> their august late father's prisons had sometimes contained as high as<br> sixty thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign<br> he had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death<br> by the executioner, {9} the boy was filled with generous indignation,<br> and commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the<br> stone that was in her breast, and give her a human heart.<br><br> Did Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince<br> who had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to<br> avenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his first<br> royal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts<br> about the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and<br> happy restoration to his native rights and splendours. But as time<br> wore on, and the prince did not come, Tom's mind became more and more<br> occupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and<br> little the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and<br> finally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an<br> unwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.<br><br> Tom's poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind.<br> At first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them, but<br> later, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt, and<br> betraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty<br> place, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums,<br> made him shudder. At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost<br> wholly. And he was content, even glad: for, whenever their mournful<br> and accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more<br> despicable than the worms that crawl.<br><br> At midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in<br> his rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded<br> by the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the day appointed<br> for his solemn crowning as King of England. At that same hour, Edward,<br> the true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn with<br> travel, and clothed in rags and shreds--his share of the results of the<br> riot--was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep<br> interest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of<br> Westminster Abbey, busy as ants: they were making the last preparation<br> for the royal coronation.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXI. The Recognition procession.<br><br> When Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a<br> thunderous murmur: all the distances were charged with it. It was<br> music to him; for it meant that the English world was out in its<br> strength to give loyal welcome to the great day.<br><br> Presently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful<br> floating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the 'recognition<br> procession' through London must start from the Tower, and he was bound<br> thither.<br><br> When he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress seemed<br> suddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent leaped a<br> red tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion<br> followed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude, and made the<br> ground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the explosions, were<br> repeated over and over again with marvellous celerity, so that in a few<br> moments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke, all<br> but the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower; this, with<br> its banners, stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak<br> projects above a cloud-rack.<br><br> Tom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed, whose rich<br> trappings almost reached to the ground; his 'uncle,' the Lord Protector<br> Somerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; the King's Guard<br> formed in single ranks on either side, clad in burnished armour;<br> after the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of<br> resplendent nobles attended by their vassals; after these came the lord<br> mayor and the aldermanic body, in crimson velvet robes, and with their<br> gold chains across their breasts; and after these the officers and<br> members of all the guilds of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the<br> showy banners of the several corporations. Also in the procession, as a<br> special guard of honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable<br> Artillery Company--an organisation already three hundred years old<br> at that time, and the only military body in England possessing the<br> privilege (which it still possesses in our day) of holding itself<br> independent of the commands of Parliament. It was a brilliant<br> spectacle, and was hailed with acclamations all along the line, as it<br> took its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens. The<br> chronicler says, 'The King, as he entered the city, was received by the<br> people with prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender words, and all signs<br> which argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign; and the<br> King, by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off, and<br> most tender language to those that stood nigh his Grace, showed himself<br> no less thankful to receive the people's goodwill than they to offer it.<br> To all that wished him well, he gave thanks. To such as bade ‘God save<br> his Grace,’ he said in return, ‘God save you all!’ and added that ‘he<br> thanked them with all his heart.’ Wonderfully transported were the<br> people with the loving answers and gestures of their King.'<br><br> In Fenchurch Street a 'fair child, in costly apparel,' stood on a stage<br> to welcome his Majesty to the city. The last verse of his greeting was<br> in these words--<br><br> 'Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think; Welcome, again, as much<br> as tongue can tell,--Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will<br> not shrink: God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.'<br><br> The people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice what<br> the child had said. Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of<br> eager faces, and his heart swelled with exultation; and he felt that<br> the one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king, and a<br> nation's idol. Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple<br> of his ragged Offal Court comrades--one of them the lord high admiral in<br> his late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the<br> same pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever. Oh,<br> if they could only recognise him now! What unspeakable glory it would<br> be, if they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king<br> of the slums and back alleys was become a real King, with illustrious<br> dukes and princes for his humble menials, and the English world at his<br> feet! But he had to deny himself, and choke down his desire, for such<br> a recognition might cost more than it would come to: so he turned away<br> his head, and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and<br> glad adulations, unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them<br> upon.<br><br> Every now and then rose the cry, ‘A largess! a largess!’ and Tom<br> responded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the<br> multitude to scramble for.<br><br> The chronicler says, 'At the upper end of Gracechurch Street, before the<br> sign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch, beneath which<br> was a stage, which stretched from one side of the street to the other.<br> This was an historical pageant, representing the King's immediate<br> progenitors. There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense<br> white rose, whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her; by her<br> side was Henry VII., issuing out of a vast red rose, disposed in the<br> same manner: the hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the<br> wedding-ring ostentatiously displayed. From the red and white roses<br> proceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by Henry<br> VIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of the new<br> King's mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side. One branch sprang<br> from this pair, which mounted to a third stage, where sat the effigy of<br> Edward VI. himself, enthroned in royal majesty; and the whole pageant<br> was framed with wreaths of roses, red and white.'<br><br> This quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people,<br> that their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child<br> whose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes. But<br> Tom Canty was not sorry; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him<br> than any poetry, no matter what its quality might be. Whithersoever Tom<br> turned his happy young face, the people recognised the exactness of his<br> effigy's likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new<br> whirlwinds of applause burst forth.<br><br> The great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after<br> another, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical<br> tableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or<br> merit, of the little King's. 'Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from<br> every penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest<br> carpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets--specimens<br> of the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this<br> thoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even<br> surpassed.'<br><br> ‘And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me--me!’<br> murmured Tom Canty.<br><br> The mock King's cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were<br> flashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. At this point,<br> just as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught<br> sight of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of<br> the second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. A<br> sickening consternation struck through him; he recognised his<br> mother! and up flew his hand, palm outward, before his eyes--that old<br> involuntary gesture, born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by<br> habit. In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press, and<br> past the guards, and was at his side. She embraced his leg, she covered<br> it with kisses, she cried, ‘O my child, my darling!’ lifting toward him<br> a face that was transfigured with joy and love. The same instant an<br> officer of the King's Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent<br> her reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his<br> strong arm. The words ‘I do not know you, woman!’ were falling from Tom<br> Canty's lips when this piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the<br> heart to see her treated so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of<br> him, whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so<br> wounded, so broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed<br> his pride to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty. His grandeurs were<br> stricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.<br><br> The procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting<br> splendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty<br> they were as if they had not been. He neither saw nor heard. Royalty<br> had lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach.<br> Remorse was eating his heart out. He said, ‘Would God I were free of<br> my captivity!’<br><br> He had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days<br> of his compulsory greatness.<br><br> The shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable<br> serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the<br> huzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes,<br> seeing only his mother's face and that wounded look in it.<br><br> ‘Largess, largess!’ The cry fell upon an unheeding ear.<br><br> ‘Long live Edward of England!’ It seemed as if the earth shook with the<br> explosion; but there was no response from the King. He heard it only as<br> one hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a<br> great distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still<br> nearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience--a voice which<br> kept repeating those shameful words, ‘I do not know you, woman!’<br><br> The words smote upon the King's soul as the strokes of a funeral bell<br> smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret<br> treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone.<br><br> New glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new marvels,<br> sprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released;<br> new raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes: but the<br> King gave no sign, and the accusing voice that went moaning through his<br> comfortless breast was all the sound he heard.<br><br> By-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little,<br> and became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety: an<br> abatement in the volume of the applause was observable too. The Lord<br> Protector was quick to notice these things: he was as quick to detect<br> the cause. He spurred to the King's side, bent low in his saddle,<br> uncovered, and said--<br><br> ‘My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. The people observe thy<br> downcast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for an omen. Be<br> advised: unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these boding<br> vapours, and disperse them. Lift up thy face, and smile upon the<br> people.’<br><br> So saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left, then<br> retired to his place. The mock King did mechanically as he had been<br> bidden. His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near enough<br> or sharp enough to detect that. The noddings of his plumed head as he<br> saluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness; the largess<br> which he delivered from his hand was royally liberal: so the people's<br> anxiety vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a<br> volume as before.<br><br> Still once more, a little before the progress was ended, the Duke was<br> obliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance. He whispered--<br><br> ‘O dread sovereign! shake off these fatal humours; the eyes of the world<br> are upon thee.’ Then he added with sharp annoyance, ‘Perdition catch<br> that crazy pauper! 'twas she that hath disturbed your Highness.’<br><br> The gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and said in a<br> dead voice--<br><br> ‘She was my mother!’<br><br> ‘My God!’ groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his<br> post, ‘the omen was pregnant with prophecy. He is gone mad again!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXII. Coronation Day.<br><br> Let us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in Westminster<br> Abbey, at four o'clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day.<br> We are not without company; for although it is still night, we find<br> the torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well<br> content to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall<br> come for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their<br> lives--the coronation of a King. Yes, London and Westminster have been<br> astir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o'clock, and already<br> crowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying<br> to find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances<br> reserved for their sort.<br><br> The hours drag along tediously enough. All stir has ceased for some<br> time, for every gallery has long ago been packed. We may sit, now, and<br> look and think at our leisure. We have glimpses, here and there<br> and yonder, through the dim cathedral twilight, of portions of many<br> galleries and balconies, wedged full with other people, the other<br> portions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by<br> intervening pillars and architectural projections. We have in view<br> the whole of the great north transept--empty, and waiting for England's<br> privileged ones. We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted with<br> rich stuffs, whereon the throne stands. The throne occupies the centre<br> of the platform, and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps.<br> Within the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock--the stone<br> of Scone--which many generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned,<br> and so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for<br> English monarchs. Both the throne and its footstool are covered with<br> cloth of gold.<br><br> Stillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily.<br> But at last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the torches are<br> extinguished, and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces. All<br> features of the noble building are distinct now, but soft and dreamy,<br> for the sun is lightly veiled with clouds.<br><br> At seven o'clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs; for on<br> the stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept, clothed<br> like Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to her appointed place<br> by an official clad in satins and velvets, whilst a duplicate of him<br> gathers up the lady's long train, follows after, and, when the lady is<br> seated, arranges the train across her lap for her. He then places her<br> footstool according to her desire, after which he puts her coronet where<br> it will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous<br> coroneting of the nobles shall arrive.<br><br> By this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream, and<br> the satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere, seating<br> them and making them comfortable. The scene is animated enough now.<br> There is stir and life, and shifting colour everywhere. After a time,<br> quiet reigns again; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their<br> places, a solid acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in<br> variegated colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds. There<br> are all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are able<br> to go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and recall the<br> crowning of Richard III. and the troublous days of that old forgotten<br> age; and there are handsome middle-aged dames; and lovely and gracious<br> young matrons; and gentle and beautiful young girls, with beaming eyes<br> and fresh complexions, who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets<br> awkwardly when the great time comes; for the matter will be new to<br> them, and their excitement will be a sore hindrance. Still, this may<br> not happen, for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a<br> special view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its<br> place when the signal comes.<br><br> We have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with<br> diamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle--but now we<br> are about to be astonished in earnest. About nine, the clouds suddenly<br> break away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and<br> drifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches<br> flames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle<br> to our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by<br> the surprise and the beauty of the spectacle! Presently a special envoy<br> from some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body<br> of foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our<br> breath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is<br> so overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his<br> slightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him.<br><br> Let us change the tense for convenience. The time drifted along--one<br> hour--two hours--two hours and a half; then the deep booming of<br> artillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at<br> last; so the waiting multitude rejoiced. All knew that a further delay<br> must follow, for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn<br> ceremony; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling<br> of the peers of the realm in their stately robes. These were conducted<br> ceremoniously to their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently<br> at hand; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with<br> interest, for most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes,<br> earls, and barons, whose names had been historical for five hundred<br> years. When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries<br> and all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and<br> to remember.<br><br> Now the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their<br> attendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places;<br> these were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and<br> these again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard.<br><br> There was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal of music<br> burst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold,<br> appeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform. The entire multitude<br> rose, and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued.<br><br> Then a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound; and<br> thus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to the throne.<br> The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive solemnity, whilst the<br> audience gazed; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion, Tom<br> Canty grew pale, and still paler, and a deep and steadily deepening woe<br> and despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful<br> heart.<br><br> At last the final act was at hand. The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted<br> up the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the<br> trembling mock-King's head. In the same instant a rainbow-radiance<br> flashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every<br> individual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised<br> it over his or her head--and paused in that attitude.<br><br> A deep hush pervaded the Abbey. At this impressive moment, a startling<br> apparition intruded upon the scene--an apparition observed by none in<br> the absorbed multitude, until it suddenly appeared, moving up the great<br> central aisle. It was a boy, bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in<br> coarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags. He raised his hand<br> with a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect,<br> and delivered this note of warning--<br><br> ‘I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head. I<br> am the King!’<br><br> In an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy; but in<br> the same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a swift step<br> forward, and cried out in a ringing voice--<br><br> ‘Loose him and forbear! He _is_ the King!’<br><br> A sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they partly<br> rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and<br> at the chief figures in this scene, like persons who wondered whether<br> they were awake and in their senses, or asleep and dreaming. The Lord<br> Protector was as amazed as the rest, but quickly recovered himself, and<br> exclaimed in a voice of authority--<br><br> ‘Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again--seize the<br> vagabond!’<br><br> He would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried<br> out--<br><br> ‘On your peril! Touch him not, he is the King!’<br><br> The hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one moved,<br> no one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say, in so<br> strange and surprising an emergency. While all minds were struggling to<br> right themselves, the boy still moved steadily forward, with high port<br> and confident mien; he had never halted from the beginning; and while<br> the tangled minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the<br> platform, and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him; and fell<br> on his knees before him and said--<br><br> ‘Oh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to<br> thee, and say, 'Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again!'‘<br><br> The Lord Protector's eye fell sternly upon the new-comer's face; but<br> straightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an expression<br> of wondering surprise. This thing happened also to the other great<br> officers. They glanced at each other, and retreated a step by a common<br> and unconscious impulse. The thought in each mind was the same: ‘What<br> a strange resemblance!’<br><br> The Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then he<br> said, with grave respectfulness--<br><br> ‘By your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions which--’<br><br> ‘I will answer them, my lord.’<br><br> The Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late King, the<br> prince, the princesses--the boy answered them correctly and without<br> hesitating. He described the rooms of state in the palace, the late<br> King's apartments, and those of the Prince of Wales.<br><br> It was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable--so all said<br> that heard it. The tide was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty's hopes to<br> run high, when the Lord Protector shook his head and said--<br><br> ‘It is true it is most wonderful--but it is no more than our lord the<br> King likewise can do.’ This remark, and this reference to himself as<br> still the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes crumbling from<br> under him. ‘These are not _proofs_,’ added the Protector.<br><br> The tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed--but in the wrong<br> direction; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne,<br> and sweeping the other out to sea. The Lord Protector communed with<br> himself--shook his head--the thought forced itself upon him, ‘It is<br> perilous to the State and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as<br> this; it could divide the nation and undermine the throne.’ He turned<br> and said--<br><br> ‘Sir Thomas, arrest this--No, hold!’ His face lighted, and he<br> confronted the ragged candidate with this question--<br><br> ‘Where lieth the Great Seal? Answer me this truly, and the riddle is<br> unriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales _can_ so answer! On so<br> trivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!’<br><br> It was a lucky thought, a happy thought. That it was so considered by<br> the great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from<br> eye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances.<br> Yes, none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the<br> vanished Great Seal--this forlorn little impostor had been taught his<br> lesson well, but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself<br> could not answer _that_ question--ah, very good, very good indeed;<br> now we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in<br> short order! And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with<br> satisfaction, and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy<br> of guilty confusion. How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of<br> the sort happen--how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a<br> confident and untroubled voice, and say--<br><br> ‘There is nought in this riddle that is difficult.’ Then, without so<br> much as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave this command,<br> with the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things: ‘My Lord<br> St. John, go you to my private cabinet in the palace--for none knoweth<br> the place better than you--and, close down to the floor, in the left<br> corner remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you<br> shall find in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little<br> jewel-closet will fly open which not even you do know of--no, nor<br> any soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did<br> contrive it for me. The first thing that falleth under your eye will be<br> the Great Seal--fetch it hither.’<br><br> All the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more to see<br> the little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent<br> fear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly convincing<br> air of having known him all his life. The peer was almost surprised<br> into obeying. He even made a movement as if to go, but quickly<br> recovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush.<br> Tom Canty turned upon him and said, sharply--<br><br> ‘Why dost thou hesitate? Hast not heard the King's command? Go!’<br><br> The Lord St. John made a deep obeisance--and it was observed that it was<br> a significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being delivered<br> at either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about half-way between<br> the two--and took his leave.<br><br> Now began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group<br> which was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and persistent--a<br> movement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly,<br> whereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join<br> themselves to another--a movement which, little by little, in the<br> present case, dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty<br> and clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer.<br> Tom Canty stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief season of deep<br> suspense and waiting--during which even the few faint hearts still<br> remaining near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to<br> glide, one by one, over to the majority. So at last Tom Canty, in his<br> royal robes and jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world,<br> a conspicuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy.<br><br> Now the Lord St. John was seen returning. As he advanced up<br> the mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of<br> conversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by<br> a profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which his footfalls<br> pulsed with a dull and distant sound. Every eye was fastened upon him<br> as he moved along. He reached the platform, paused a moment, then moved<br> toward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance, and said--<br><br> ‘Sire, the Seal is not there!’<br><br> A mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more<br> haste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from<br> the presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown. In a moment<br> he stood all alone, without friend or supporter, a target upon which<br> was concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks. The Lord<br> Protector called out fiercely--<br><br> ‘Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the town--the<br> paltry knave is worth no more consideration!’<br><br> Officers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty waved them<br> off and said--<br><br> ‘Back! Whoso touches him perils his life!’<br><br> The Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree. He said to the<br> Lord St. John--<br><br> ‘Searched you well?--but it boots not to ask that. It doth seem passing<br> strange. Little things, trifles, slip out of one's ken, and one does<br> not think it matter for surprise; but how so bulky a thing as the<br> Seal of England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it<br> again--a massy golden disk--’<br><br> Tom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted--<br><br> ‘Hold, that is enough! Was it round?--and thick?--and had it letters<br> and devices graved upon it?--yes? Oh, _now_ I know what this Great Seal<br> is that there's been such worry and pother about. An' ye had described<br> it to me, ye could have had it three weeks ago. Right well I know where<br> it lies; but it was not I that put it there--first.’<br><br> ‘Who, then, my liege?’ asked the Lord Protector.<br><br> ‘He that stands there--the rightful King of England. And he shall tell<br> you himself where it lies--then you will believe he knew it of his own<br> knowledge. Bethink thee, my King--spur thy memory--it was the last, the<br> very _last_ thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from<br> the palace, clothed in my rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me.’<br><br> A silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper, and all eyes<br> were fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent head and corrugated<br> brow, groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless<br> recollections for one single little elusive fact, which, found, would<br> seat him upon a throne--unfound, would leave him as he was, for good and<br> all--a pauper and an outcast. Moment after moment passed--the moments<br> built themselves into minutes--still the boy struggled silently on, and<br> gave no sign. But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and<br> said, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice--<br><br> ‘I call the scene back--all of it--but the Seal hath no place in it.’<br> He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity, ‘My lords and<br> gentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of<br> this evidence which he is not able to furnish, I may not stay ye, being<br> powerless. But--’<br><br> ‘Oh, folly, oh, madness, my King!’ cried Tom Canty, in a panic,<br> ‘wait!--think! Do not give up!--the cause is not lost! Nor _shall_ be,<br> neither! List to what I say--follow every word--I am going to bring that<br> morning back again, every hap just as it happened. We talked--I told<br> you of my sisters, Nan and Bet--ah, yes, you remember that; and about<br> mine old grandam--and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court--yes,<br> you remember these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall<br> recall everything. You gave me food and drink, and did with princely<br> courtesy send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame<br> me before them--ah, yes, this also you remember.’<br><br> As Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his head in<br> recognition of them, the great audience and the officials stared in<br> puzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history, yet how could<br> this impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come<br> about? Never was a company of people so perplexed, so interested, and<br> so stupefied, before.<br><br> ‘For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments. Then we stood before<br> a mirror; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had<br> been no change made--yes, you remember that. Then you noticed that the<br> soldier had hurt my hand--look! here it is, I cannot yet even write with<br> it, the fingers are so stiff. At this your Highness sprang up, vowing<br> vengeance upon that soldier, and ran towards the door--you passed a<br> table--that thing you call the Seal lay on that table--you snatched<br> it up and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it--your eye<br> caught sight of--’<br><br> ‘There, 'tis sufficient!--and the good God be thanked!’ exclaimed the<br> ragged claimant, in a mighty excitement. ‘Go, my good St. John--in an<br> arm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall, thou'lt find<br> the Seal!’<br><br> ‘Right, my King! right!’ cried Tom Canty; ‘_Now_ the sceptre of England<br> is thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he<br> had been born dumb! Go, my Lord St. John, give thy feet wings!’<br><br> The whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of its mind<br> with uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement. On the floor<br> and on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst<br> forth, and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was<br> interested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear,<br> or he was shouting into his neighbour's ear. Time--nobody knew how much<br> of it--swept by unheeded and unnoted. At last a sudden hush fell upon<br> the house, and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform,<br> and held the Great Seal aloft in his hand. Then such a shout went up--<br><br> ‘Long live the true King!’<br><br> For five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical<br> instruments, and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs; and<br> through it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous figure in England,<br> stood, flushed and happy and proud, in the centre of the spacious<br> platform, with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him.<br><br> Then all rose, and Tom Canty cried out--<br><br> ‘Now, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor Tom, thy<br> servant, his shreds and remnants again.’<br><br> The Lord Protector spoke up--<br><br> ‘Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower.’<br><br> But the new King, the true King, said--<br><br> ‘I will not have it so. But for him I had not got my crown again--none<br> shall lay a hand upon him to harm him. And as for thee, my good uncle,<br> my Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is not grateful toward<br> this poor lad, for I hear he hath made thee a duke’--the Protector<br> blushed--’yet he was not a king; wherefore what is thy fine title<br> worth now? To-morrow you shall sue to me, _through him_, for its<br> confirmation, else no duke, but a simple earl, shalt thou remain.’<br><br> Under this rebuke, his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from<br> the front for the moment. The King turned to Tom, and said kindly--’My<br> poor boy, how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I<br> could not remember it myself?’<br><br> ‘Ah, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days.’<br><br> ‘Used it--yet could not explain where it was?’<br><br> ‘I did not know it was _that_ they wanted. They did not describe it,<br> your Majesty.’<br><br> ‘Then how used you it?’<br><br> The red blood began to steal up into Tom's cheeks, and he dropped his<br> eyes and was silent.<br><br> ‘Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing,’ said the King. ‘How used you<br> the Great Seal of England?’<br><br> Tom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it out--<br><br> ‘To crack nuts with!’<br><br> Poor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him<br> off his feet. But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was<br> not the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of<br> royalty, this reply disposed of it utterly.<br><br> Meantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom's<br> shoulders to the King's, whose rags were effectually hidden from sight<br> under it. Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed; the true King<br> was anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst cannon thundered<br> the news to the city, and all London seemed to rock with applause.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIII. Edward as King.<br><br> Miles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on<br> London Bridge--he was more so when he got out of it. He had but little<br> money when he got in, none at all when he got out. The pickpockets had<br> stripped him of his last farthing.<br><br> But no matter, so he found his boy. Being a soldier, he did not go at<br> his task in a random way, but set to work, first of all, to arrange his<br> campaign.<br><br> What would the boy naturally do? Where would he naturally go?<br> Well--argued Miles--he would naturally go to his former haunts, for that<br> is the instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and forsaken, as well<br> as of sound ones. Whereabouts were his former haunts? His rags,<br> taken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even<br> claimed to be his father, indicated that his home was in one or another<br> of the poorest and meanest districts of London. Would the search for<br> him be difficult, or long? No, it was likely to be easy and brief. He<br> would not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of<br> a big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor<br> little friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself<br> with pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself<br> King, as usual. Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people,<br> and carry off his little ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving<br> words, and the two would never be separated any more.<br><br> So Miles started on his quest. Hour after hour he tramped through back<br> alleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds, and finding no<br> end of them, but never any sign of the boy. This greatly surprised him,<br> but did not discourage him. To his notion, there was nothing the matter<br> with his plan of campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the<br> campaign was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be<br> short.<br><br> When daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and canvassed<br> many a crowd, but the only result was that he was tolerably tired,<br> rather hungry and very sleepy. He wanted some breakfast, but there was<br> no way to get it. To beg for it did not occur to him; as to pawning<br> his sword, he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour;<br> he could spare some of his clothes--yes, but one could as easily find a<br> customer for a disease as for such clothes.<br><br> At noon he was still tramping--among the rabble which followed after<br> the royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would<br> attract his little lunatic powerfully. He followed the pageant through<br> all its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster<br> and the Abbey. He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes<br> that were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time, baffled and<br> perplexed, and finally wandered off, thinking, and trying to contrive<br> some way to better his plan of campaign. By-and-by, when he came to<br> himself out of his musings, he discovered that the town was far behind<br> him and that the day was growing old. He was near the river, and in the<br> country; it was a region of fine rural seats--not the sort of district<br> to welcome clothes like his.<br><br> It was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee<br> of a hedge to rest and think. Drowsiness presently began to settle upon<br> his senses; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear,<br> and he said to himself, ‘The new King is crowned,’ and straightway fell<br> asleep. He had not slept or rested, before, for more than thirty hours.<br> He did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning.<br><br> He got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the river,<br> stayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged off toward<br> Westminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time.<br> Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try to get speech with<br> old Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks, and--but that was enough<br> of a plan for the present; it would be time enough to enlarge it when<br> this first stage should be accomplished.<br><br> Toward eleven o'clock he approached the palace; and although a host of<br> showy people were about him, moving in the same direction, he was not<br> inconspicuous--his costume took care of that. He watched these people's<br> faces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might<br> be willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant--as to trying to get<br> into the palace himself, that was simply out of the question.<br><br> Presently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and scanned<br> his figure well, saying to himself, ‘An' that is not the very vagabond<br> his Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an ass--though belike I<br> was that before. He answereth the description to a rag--that God should<br> make two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition. I<br> would I could contrive an excuse to speak with him.’<br><br> Miles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then, as a man<br> generally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from<br> behind; and observing a strong interest in the boy's eyes, he stepped<br> toward him and said--<br><br> ‘You have just come out from the palace; do you belong there?’<br><br> ‘Yes, your worship.’<br><br> ‘Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?’<br><br> The boy started, and said to himself, ‘Lord! mine old departed father!’<br> Then he answered aloud, ‘Right well, your worship.’<br><br> ‘Good--is he within?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said the boy; and added, to himself, ‘within his grave.’<br><br> ‘Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say<br> a word in his ear?’<br><br> ‘I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir.’<br><br> ‘Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without--I shall be<br> greatly bounden to you, my good lad.’<br><br> The boy looked disappointed. ‘The King did not name him so,’ he said to<br> himself; ‘but it mattereth not, this is his twin brother, and can give<br> his Majesty news of t'other Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant.’ So he said<br> to Miles, ‘Step in there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you<br> word.’<br><br> Hendon retired to the place indicated--it was a recess sunk in the<br> palace wall, with a stone bench in it--a shelter for sentinels in bad<br> weather. He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers, in charge<br> of an officer, passed by. The officer saw him, halted his men, and<br> commanded Hendon to come forth. He obeyed, and was promptly arrested<br> as a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace.<br> Things began to look ugly. Poor Miles was going to explain, but the<br> officer roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and<br> search him.<br><br> ‘God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat,’ said poor Miles; ‘I<br> have searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater than theirs.’<br><br> Nothing was found but a document. The officer tore it open, and Hendon<br> smiled when he recognised the 'pot-hooks' made by his lost little friend<br> that black day at Hendon Hall. The officer's face grew dark as he read<br> the English paragraph, and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he<br> listened.<br><br> ‘Another new claimant of the Crown!’ cried the officer. ‘Verily they<br> breed like rabbits, to-day. Seize the rascal, men, and see ye keep<br> him fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the<br> King.’<br><br> He hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers.<br><br> ‘Now is my evil luck ended at last,’ muttered Hendon, ‘for I shall<br> dangle at a rope's end for a certainty, by reason of that bit of<br> writing. And what will become of my poor lad!--ah, only the good God<br> knoweth.’<br><br> By-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so he<br> plucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as became a<br> man. The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his<br> sword to him; then bowed respectfully, and said--<br><br> ‘Please you, sir, to follow me.’<br><br> Hendon followed, saying to himself, ‘An' I were not travelling to death<br> and judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would throttle this<br> knave for his mock courtesy.’<br><br> The two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand entrance of<br> the palace, where the officer, with another bow, delivered Hendon into<br> the hands of a gorgeous official, who received him with profound respect<br> and led him forward through a great hall, lined on both sides with rows<br> of splendid flunkeys (who made reverential obeisance as the two passed<br> along, but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately<br> scarecrow the moment his back was turned), and up a broad staircase,<br> among flocks of fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room,<br> clove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then<br> made a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing in<br> the middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of indignant<br> frowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles.<br><br> Miles Hendon was entirely bewildered. There sat the young King, under<br> a canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent down and aside,<br> speaking with a sort of human bird of paradise--a duke, maybe. Hendon<br> observed to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death<br> in the full vigour of life, without having this peculiarly public<br> humiliation added. He wished the King would hurry about it--some of the<br> gaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive. At this moment<br> the King raised his head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his<br> face. The sight nearly took his breath away!--He stood gazing at the<br> fair young face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated--<br><br> ‘Lo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne!’<br><br> He muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then<br> turned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the<br> splendid saloon, murmuring, ‘But these are _real_--verily these are<br> _real_--surely it is not a dream.’<br><br> He stared at the King again--and thought, ‘_Is_ it a dream . . . or _is_<br> he the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless poor Tom<br> o' Bedlam I took him for--who shall solve me this riddle?’<br><br> A sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up<br> a chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!<br><br> A buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him and a<br> voice exclaimed--<br><br> ‘Up, thou mannerless clown! would'st sit in the presence of the King?’<br><br> The disturbance attracted his Majesty's attention, who stretched forth<br> his hand and cried out--<br><br> ‘Touch him not, it is his right!’<br><br> The throng fell back, stupefied. The King went on--<br><br> ‘Learn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my trusty and<br> well-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his good sword and<br> saved his prince from bodily harm and possible death--and for this he is<br> a knight, by the King's voice. Also learn, that for a higher service,<br> in that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame, taking these upon<br> himself, he is a peer of England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold<br> and lands meet for the dignity. More--the privilege which he hath just<br> exercised is his by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs<br> of his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the<br> Majesty of England henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown shall<br> endure. Molest him not.’<br><br> Two persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the country<br> during this morning, and had now been in this room only five minutes,<br> stood listening to these words and looking at the King, then at the<br> scarecrow, then at the King again, in a sort of torpid bewilderment.<br> These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith. But the new Earl did not<br> see them. He was still staring at the monarch, in a dazed way, and<br> muttering--<br><br> ‘Oh, body o' me! _this_ my pauper! This my lunatic! This is he whom<br> _I_ would show what grandeur was, in my house of seventy rooms and<br> seven-and-twenty servants! This is he who had never known aught but<br> rags for raiment, kicks for comfort, and offal for diet! This is he<br> whom _I_ adopted and would make respectable! Would God I had a bag to<br> hide my head in!’<br><br> Then his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon his<br> knees, with his hands between the King's, and swore allegiance and did<br> homage for his lands and titles. Then he rose and stood respectfully<br> aside, a mark still for all eyes--and much envy, too.<br><br> Now the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful voice and<br> kindling eye--<br><br> ‘Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put him<br> under lock and key till I have need of him.’<br><br> The late Sir Hugh was led away.<br><br> There was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the assemblage fell<br> apart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed, marched down, between<br> these living walls, preceded by an usher. He knelt before the King, who<br> said--<br><br> ‘I have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well pleased<br> with thee. Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and<br> mercy. Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again? Good; they<br> shall be cared for--and thy father shall hang, if thou desire it and the<br> law consent. Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they<br> that abide in the shelter of Christ's Hospital and share the King's<br> bounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their baser<br> parts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief place in its<br> honourable body of governors, during life. And for that he hath been<br> a king, it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due;<br> wherefore note this his dress of state, for by it he shall be known, and<br> none shall copy it; and wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the<br> people that he hath been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his<br> due of reverence or fail to give him salutation. He hath the throne's<br> protection, he hath the crown's support, he shall be known and called by<br> the honourable title of the King's Ward.’<br><br> The proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King's hand, and was<br> conducted from the presence. He did not waste any time, but flew to his<br> mother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help<br> him enjoy the great news. {1}<br><br> Conclusion. Justice and retribution.<br><br> When the mysteries were all cleared up, it came out, by confession of<br> Hugh Hendon, that his wife had repudiated Miles by his command, that<br> day at Hendon Hall--a command assisted and supported by the perfectly<br> trustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was Miles Hendon,<br> and stand firmly to it, he would have her life; whereupon she said,<br> ‘Take it!’--she did not value it--and she would not repudiate<br> Miles; then the husband said he would spare her life but have Miles<br> assassinated! This was a different matter; so she gave her word and<br> kept it.<br><br> Hugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brother's<br> estates and title, because the wife and brother would not testify<br> against him--and the former would not have been allowed to do it, even<br> if she had wanted to. Hugh deserted his wife and went over to the<br> continent, where he presently died; and by-and-by the Earl of Kent<br> married his relict. There were grand times and rejoicings at Hendon<br> village when the couple paid their first visit to the Hall.<br><br> Tom Canty's father was never heard of again.<br><br> The King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave,<br> and reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler's gang, and put<br> him in the way of a comfortable livelihood.<br><br> He also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine. He<br> provided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist women whom he<br> saw burned at the stake, and roundly punished the official who laid the<br> undeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon's back.<br><br> He saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon, and<br> also the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver; but he<br> was too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in<br> the royal forest.<br><br> He showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed<br> to have stolen a pig, and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in<br> the public esteem and become a great and honoured man.<br><br> As long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of his<br> adventures, all through, from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him<br> away from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed<br> himself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the Abbey<br> and climbed up and hid himself in the Confessor's tomb, and then slept<br> so long, next day, that he came within one of missing the Coronation<br> altogether. He said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson<br> kept him strong in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to<br> his people; and so, whilst his life was spared he should continue to<br> tell the story, and thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his<br> memory and the springs of pity replenished in his heart.<br><br> Miles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King, all through his<br> brief reign, and his sincere mourners when he died. The good Earl<br> of Kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege; but he<br> exercised it twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was<br> called from this world--once at the accession of Queen Mary, and once at<br> the accession of Queen Elizabeth. A descendant of his exercised it<br> at the accession of James I. Before this one's son chose to use the<br> privilege, near a quarter of a century had elapsed, and the 'privilege<br> of the Kents' had faded out of most people's memories; so, when the Kent<br> of that day appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down in the<br> sovereign's presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house,<br> there was a fine stir indeed! But the matter was soon explained, and<br> the right confirmed. The last Earl of the line fell in the wars of the<br> Commonwealth fighting for the King, and the odd privilege ended with<br> him.<br><br> Tom Canty lived to be a very old man, a handsome, white-haired old<br> fellow, of grave and benignant aspect. As long as he lasted he was<br> honoured; and he was also reverenced, for his striking and peculiar<br> costume kept the people reminded that 'in his time he had been royal;'<br> so, wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart, making way for him, and<br> whispering, one to another, ‘Doff thy hat, it is the King's Ward!’--and<br> so they saluted, and got his kindly smile in return--and they valued it,<br> too, for his was an honourable history.<br><br> Yes, King Edward VI. lived only a few years, poor boy, but he lived them<br> worthily. More than once, when some great dignitary, some gilded vassal<br> of the crown, made argument against his leniency, and urged that some<br> law which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose,<br> and wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind,<br> the young King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate<br> eyes upon him and answered--<br><br> ‘What dost _thou_ know of suffering and oppression? I and my people<br> know, but not thou.’<br><br> The reign of Edward VI. was a singularly merciful one for those harsh<br> times. Now that we are taking leave of him, let us try to keep this in<br> our minds, to his credit.<br><br> FOOTNOTES AND TWAIN'S NOTES<br><br> {1} For Mark Twain's note see below under the relevant chapter heading.<br><br> {2} He refers to the order of baronets, or baronettes; the barones<br> minores, as distinct from the parliamentary barons--not, it need hardly<br> be said, to the baronets of later creation.<br><br> {3} The lords of Kingsale, descendants of De Courcy, still enjoy this<br> curious privilege.<br><br> {4} Hume.<br><br> {5} Ib.<br><br> {6} Leigh Hunt's 'The Town,' p.408, quotation from an early tourist.<br><br> {7} Canting terms for various kinds of thieves, beggars and vagabonds,<br> and their female companions.<br><br> {8} From 'The English Rogue.'

All laws were<br> repealed which extended the crime of treason beyond the statute of the<br> twenty-fifth of Edward III.; all laws enacted during the late reign<br> extending the crime of felony; all the former laws against Lollardy or<br> heresy, together with the statute of the Six Articles. None were to be<br> accused for words, but within a month after they were spoken. By<br> these repeals several of the most rigorous laws that ever had passed<br> in England were annulled; and some dawn, both of civil and religious<br> liberty, began to appear to the people. A repeal also passed of that<br> law, the destruction of all laws, by which the King's proclamation was<br> made of equal force with a statute.--Ibid. vol. iii. p. 339.<br><br> Boiling to Death.<br><br> In the reign of Henry VIII. poisoners were, by Act of Parliament,<br> condemned to be _boiled to death_. This Act was repealed in the<br> following reign.<br><br> In Germany, even in the seventeenth century, this horrible punishment<br> was inflicted on coiners and counterfeiters. Taylor, the Water Poet,<br> describes an execution he witnessed in Hamburg in 1616. The judgment<br> pronounced against a coiner of false money was that he should '_be<br> boiled to death in oil_; not thrown into the vessel at once, but with<br> a pulley or rope to be hanged under the armpits, and then let down into<br> the oil _by degrees_; first the feet, and next the legs, and so to boil<br> his flesh from his bones alive.'--Dr. J.

Three years<br> afterwards he gave new offence to Laud by publishing a pamphlet against<br> the hierarchy. He was again prosecuted, and was sentenced to lose _what<br> remained of his ears_, to pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, to be _branded on<br> both his cheeks_ with the letters S. L. (for Seditious Libeller), and to<br> remain in prison for life. The severity of this sentence was equalled<br> by the savage rigour of its execution.--Ibid. p. 12.<br><br> NOTES to Chapter XXXIII.<br><br> Christ's Hospital, or Bluecoat School, 'the noblest institution in the<br> world.'<br><br> The ground on which the Priory of the Grey Friars stood was conferred<br> by Henry VIII. on the Corporation of London (who caused the institution<br> there of a home for poor boys and girls). Subsequently, Edward VI.<br> caused the old Priory to be properly repaired, and founded within<br> it that noble establishment called the Bluecoat School, or Christ's<br> Hospital, for the _education_ and maintenance of orphans and the<br> children of indigent persons . . . Edward would not let him (Bishop<br> Ridley) depart till the letter was written (to the Lord Mayor), and then<br> charged him to deliver it himself, and signify his special request and<br> commandment that no time might be lost in proposing what was convenient,<br> and apprising him of the proceedings. The work was zealously<br> undertaken, Ridley himself engaging in it; and the result was the<br> founding of Christ's Hospital for the education of poor children. (The<br> King endowed several other charities at the same time.) ‘Lord God,’ said<br> he, ‘I yield Thee most hearty thanks that Thou hast given me life thus<br> long to finish this work to the glory of Thy name!’ That innocent and<br> most exemplary life was drawing rapidly to its close, and in a few days<br> he rendered up his spirit to his Creator, praying God to defend the<br> realm from Papistry.--J. Heneage Jesse's London: its Celebrated<br> Characters and Places.<br><br> In the Great Hall hangs a large picture of King Edward VI. seated on his<br> throne, in a scarlet and ermined robe, holding the sceptre in his left<br> hand, and presenting with the other the Charter to the kneeling Lord<br> Mayor. By his side stands the Chancellor, holding the seals, and next<br> to him are other officers of state. Bishop Ridley kneels before him<br> with uplifted hands, as if supplicating a blessing on the event; whilst<br> the Aldermen, etc., with the Lord Mayor, kneel on both sides, occupying<br> the middle ground of the picture; and lastly, in front, are a double row<br> of boys on one side and girls on the other, from the master and matron<br> down to the boy and girl who have stepped forward from their respective<br> rows, and kneel with raised hands before the King.--Timbs' Curiosities<br> of London, p. 98.<br><br> Christ's Hospital, by ancient custom, possesses the privilege of<br> addressing the Sovereign on the occasion of his or her coming into the<br> City to partake of the hospitality of the Corporation of London.--Ibid.<br><br> The Dining Hall, with its lobby and organ-gallery, occupies the entire<br> storey, which is 187 feet long, 51 feet wide, and 47 feet high; it is<br> lit by nine large windows, filled with stained glass on the south side;<br> and is, next to Westminster Hall, the noblest room in the metropolis.<br> Here the boys, now about 800 in number, dine; and here are held the<br> 'Suppings in Public,' to which visitors are admitted by tickets issued<br> by the Treasurer and by the Governors of Christ's Hospital. The tables<br> are laid with cheese in wooden bowls, beer in wooden piggins, poured<br> from leathern jacks, and bread brought in large baskets. The official<br> company enter; the Lord Mayor, or President, takes his seat in a state<br> chair made of oak from St. Catherine's Church, by the Tower; a hymn<br> is sung, accompanied by the organ; a 'Grecian,' or head boy, reads the<br> prayers from the pulpit, silence being enforced by three drops of a<br> wooden hammer. After prayer the supper commences, and the visitors walk<br> between the tables. At its close the 'trade-boys' take up the baskets,<br> bowls, jacks, piggins, and candlesticks, and pass in procession, the<br> bowing to the Governors being curiously formal. This spectacle was<br> witnessed by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1845.<br><br> Among the more eminent Bluecoat boys are Joshua Barnes, editor<br> of Anacreon and Euripides; Jeremiah Markland, the eminent critic,<br> particularly in Greek Literature; Camden, the antiquary; Bishop<br> Stillingfleet; Samuel Richardson, the novelist; Thomas Mitchell, the<br> translator of Aristophanes; Thomas Barnes, many years editor of the<br> London Times; Coleridge, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt.<br><br> No boy is admitted before he is seven years old, or after he is nine;<br> and no boy can remain in the school after he is fifteen, King's boys and<br> 'Grecians' alone excepted. There are about 500 Governors, at the head<br> of whom are the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales. The qualification<br> for a Governor is payment of 500 pounds.--Ibid.<br><br> GENERAL NOTE.<br><br> One hears much about the 'hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,' and is<br> accustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned. There are people<br> in America--and even in England!--who imagine that they were a very<br> monument of malignity, pitilessness, and inhumanity; whereas in reality<br> they were about the first _sweeping departure from judicial atrocity_<br> which the 'civilised' world had seen. This humane and kindly Blue Law<br> Code, of two hundred and forty years ago, stands all by itself,<br> with ages of bloody law on the further side of it, and a century and<br> three-quarters of bloody English law on _this_ side of it.<br><br> There has never been a time--under the Blue Laws or any other--when<br> above _fourteen_ crimes were punishable by death in Connecticut. But in<br> England, within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind,<br> _two hundred and twenty-three_ crimes were punishable by death! {10}<br> These facts are worth knowing--and worth thinking about, too."}
