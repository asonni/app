				"main_text": "My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains<br> My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, <br> Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains <br> One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: <br> 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, <br> But being too happy in thine happiness,-- <br> That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees<br> In some melodious plot <br> Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, <br> Singest of summer in full-throated ease. <br><br> O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been <br> Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth, <br> Tasting of Flora and the country green, <br> Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth! <br> O for a beaker full of the warm South, <br> Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, <br> With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, <br> And purple-stained mouth; <br> That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, <br> And with thee fade away into the forest dim: <br><br> Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget <br> What thou among the leaves hast never known, <br> The weariness, the fever, and the fret <br> Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; <br> Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, <br> Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; <br> Where but to think is to be full of sorrow <br> And leaden-eyed despairs, <br> Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, <br> Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. <br><br> Away! away! for I will fly to thee, <br> Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, <br> But on the viewless wings of Poesy, <br> Though the dull brain perplexes and retards: <br> Already with thee! tender is the night, <br> And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, <br> Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays; <br> But here there is no light, <br> Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown <br> Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. <br><br> I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, <br> Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, <br> But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet <br> Wherewith the seasonable month endows <br> The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild; <br> White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; <br> Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves; <br> And mid-May's eldest child,<br> The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, <br> The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. <br><br> Darkling I listen; and, for many a time <br> I have been half in love with easeful Death, <br> Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme, <br> To take into the air my quiet breath; <br> Now more than ever seems it rich to die, <br> To cease upon the midnight with no pain, <br> While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad <br> In such an ecstasy! <br> Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain-- <br> To thy high requiem become a sod. <br><br> Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird! <br> No hungry generations tread thee down; <br> The voice I hear this passing night was heard <br> In ancient days by emperor and clown: <br> Perhaps the self-same song that found a path <br> Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, <br> She stood in tears amid the alien corn; <br> The same that oft-times hath <br> Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam <br> Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. <br><br> Forlorn! the very word is like a bell <br> To toll me back from thee to my sole self! <br> Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well <br> As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf. <br> Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades <br> Past the near meadows, over the still stream, <br> Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep <br> In the next valley-glades: <br> Was it a vision, or a waking dream? <br> Fled is that music:--Do I wake or sleep?"
