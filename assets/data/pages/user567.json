Slugs leave their lair-<br><br> The bees are stirring-birds are on the wing-<br><br> And Winter slumbering in the open air,<br><br> Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!<br><br> And I the while, the sole unbusy thing,<br><br> Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.<br><br><br><br>Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,<br><br> Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.<br><br> Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,<br><br> For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!<br><br> With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:<br><br> And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?<br><br> Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,<br><br> And Hope without an object cannot live.<br><br>(composed 21st February 1825)",
