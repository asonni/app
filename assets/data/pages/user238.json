				"main_text": "As I left the Halls at Lumley, rose the vision of a comely<br>Maid last season worshipped dumbly, watched with fervor from afar;<br>And I wondered idly, blindly, if the maid would greet me kindly.<br>That was all -- the rest was settled by the clinking tonga-bar.<br>Yea, my life and hers were coupled by the tonga coupling-bar.<br><br>For my misty meditation, at the second changin-station,<br>Suffered sudden dislocation, fled before the tuneless jar<br>Of a Wagner obbligato, scherzo, doublehand staccato,<br>Played on either pony's saddle by the clacking tonga-bar --<br>Played with human speech, I fancied, by the jigging, jolting bar.<br><br>'She was sweet,' thought I, 'last season, but 'twere surely wild unreason<br>Such tiny hope to freeze on as was offered by my Star,<br>When she whispered, something sadly: 'I -- we feel your going badly!'<br>'And you let the chance escape you?' rapped the rattling tonga-bar.<br>'What a chance and what an idiot!' clicked the vicious tonga-bar.<br><br>Heart of man -- oh, heart of putty! Had I gone by Kakahutti,<br>On the old Hill-road and rutty, I had 'scaped that fatal car.<br>But his fortune each must bide by, so I watched the milestones slide by,<br>To 'You call on Her to-morrow!' -- fugue with cymbals by the bar --<br>You must call on Her to-morrow!' -- post-horn gallop by the bar.<br><br>Yet a further stage my goal on -- we were whirling down to Solon,<br>With a double lurch and roll on, best foot foremost, ganz und gar --<br>'She was very sweet,' I hinted. 'If a kiss had been imprinted?' --<br>''Would ha' saved a world of trouble!' clashed the busy tonga-bar.<br>''Been accepted or rejected!' banged and clanged the tonga-bar.<br><br>Then a notion wild and daring, 'spite the income tax's paring,<br>And a hasty thought of sharing -- less than many incomes are,<br>Made me put a question private, you can guess what I would drive at.<br>'You must work the sum to prove it,' clanked the careless tonga-bar.<br>'Simple Rule of Two will prove it,' litled back the tonga-bar.<br><br>It was under Khyraghaut I muse. 'Suppose the maid be haughty --<br>(There are lovers rich -- and roty) -- wait some wealthy Avatar?<br>Answer monitor untiring, 'twixt the ponies twain perspiring!'<br>'Faint heart never won fair lady,' creaked the straining tonga-bar.<br>'Can I tell you ere you ask Her?' pounded slow the tonga-bar.<br><br>Last, the Tara Devi turning showed the lights of Simla burning,<br>Lit my little lazy yearning to a fiercer flame by far.<br>As below the Mall we jingled, through my very heart it tingled --<br>Did the iterated order of the threshing tonga-bar --<br>Truy your luck -- you can't do better!' twanged the loosened tongar-bar.
