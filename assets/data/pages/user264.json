				"main_text": "Oh! snatched away in beauty's bloom,<br>On thee shall press no ponderous tomb;<br>But on thy turf shall roses rear<br>Their leaves, the earliest of the year;<br>And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom:<br><br>And oft by yon blue gushing stream<br>Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head,<br>And feed deep thought with many a dream,<br>And lingering pause and lightly tread;<br>Fond wretch! as if her step disturbed the dead!<br><br>Away! ye know that tears are vain,<br>That death nor heeds nor hears distress:<br>Will this unteach us to complain?<br>Or make one mourner weep the less?<br>And thou -who tell'st me to forget,<br>Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet."
