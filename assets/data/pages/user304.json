I myself can hardly understand.<br>We must leave it now to fate.<br>You will write, at any rate.<br>Perhaps it is not too late.<br>I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.'<br><br>And I must borrow every changing shape <br>To find expression ... dance, dance<br>Like a dancing bear,<br>Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.<br>Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance--<br>Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,<br>Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;<br>Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand<br>With the smoke coming down above the housetops;<br>Doubtful, for quite a while<br>Not knowing what to feel or if I understand<br>Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...<br>Would she not have the advantage, after all?<br>This music is successful with a 'dying fall'<br>Now that we talk of dying--<br>And should I have the right to smile?"
