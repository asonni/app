				"main_text": "Late August, given heavy rain and sun<br> For a full week, the blackberries would ripen.<br> At first, just one, a glossy purple clot<br> Among others, red, green, hard as a knot.<br> You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet<br> Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it<br> Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for<br> Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger<br> Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots<br> Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.<br> Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills<br> We trekked and picked until the cans were full<br> Until the tinkling bottom had been covered<br> With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned<br> Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered<br> With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.<br> We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.<br> But when the bath was filled we found a fur,<br> A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.<br> The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush<br> The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.<br> I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair<br> That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.<br> Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not."
