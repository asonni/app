You TOM!’<br><br> No answer.<br><br> The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the<br> room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or<br> never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were<br> her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for ‘style,’ not<br> service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.<br> She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but<br> still loud enough for the furniture to hear:<br><br> ‘Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--’<br><br> She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching<br> under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the<br> punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.<br><br> ‘I never did see the beat of that boy!’<br><br> She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the<br> tomato vines and ‘jimpson’ weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So<br> she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:<br><br> ‘Y-o-u-u TOM!’<br><br> There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize<br> a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.<br><br> ‘There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in<br> there?’<br><br> ‘Nothing.’<br><br> ‘Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What is that<br> truck?’<br><br> ‘I don't know, aunt.’<br><br> ‘Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you<br> didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.’<br><br> The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--<br><br> ‘My! Look behind you, aunt!’<br><br> The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.<br> The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and<br> disappeared over it.<br><br> His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle<br> laugh.<br><br> ‘Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks<br> enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old<br> fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks,<br> as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,<br> and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long<br> he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make<br> out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and<br> I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's<br> the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child,<br> as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both,<br> I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own<br> dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him,<br> somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and<br> every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is<br> born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture<br> says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [*<br> Southwestern for ‘afternoon’] I'll just be obleeged to make him work,<br> tomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,<br> when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he<br> hates anything else, and I've got to do some of my duty by him, or<br> I'll be the ruination of the child.’<br><br> Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home<br> barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood<br> and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time<br> to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.<br> Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through<br> with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,<br> and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.<br><br> While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity<br> offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and<br> very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like<br> many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she<br> was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she<br> loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low<br> cunning. Said she:<br><br> ‘Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?’<br><br> ‘Yes'm.’<br><br> ‘Powerful warm, warn't it?’<br><br> ‘Yes'm.’<br><br> ‘Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?’<br><br> A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He<br> searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:<br><br> ‘No'm--well, not very much.’<br><br> The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:<br><br> ‘But you ain't too warm now, though.’ And it flattered her to reflect<br> that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing<br> that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew<br> where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:<br><br> ‘Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?’<br><br> Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of<br> circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new<br> inspiration:<br><br> ‘Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to<br> pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!’<br><br> The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt<br> collar was securely sewed.<br><br> ‘Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey<br> and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a<br> singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. This time.’<br><br> She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom<br> had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.<br><br> But Sidney said:<br><br> ‘Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,<br> but it's black.’<br><br> ‘Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!’<br><br> But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:<br><br> ‘Siddy, I'll lick you for that.’<br><br> In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into<br> the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle<br> carried white thread and the other black. He said:<br><br> ‘She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes<br> she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to<br> gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But<br> I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!’<br><br> He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well<br> though--and loathed him.<br><br> Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not<br> because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a<br> man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore<br> them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's<br> misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new<br> interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired<br> from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It<br> consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,<br> produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short<br> intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to<br> do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him<br> the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of<br> harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer<br> feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep,<br> unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the<br> astronomer.<br><br> The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom<br> checked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger<br> than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive<br> curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy<br> was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply as<br> astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth<br> roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes<br> on--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of<br> ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The<br> more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose<br> at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to<br> him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but only<br> sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the<br> time. Finally Tom said:<br><br> ‘I can lick you!’<br><br> ‘I'd like to see you try it.’<br><br> ‘Well, I can do it.’<br><br> ‘No you can't, either.’<br><br> ‘Yes I can.’<br><br> ‘No you can't.’<br><br> ‘I can.’<br><br> ‘You can't.’<br><br> ‘Can!’<br><br> ‘Can't!’<br><br> An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:<br><br> ‘What's your name?’<br><br> ‘'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.’<br><br> ‘Well I 'low I'll make it my business.’<br><br> ‘Well why don't you?’<br><br> ‘If you say much, I will.’<br><br> ‘Much--much--much. There now.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you think you're mighty smart, don't you? I could lick you with<br> one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.’<br><br> ‘Well why don't you do it? You say you can do it.’<br><br> ‘Well I will, if you fool with me.’<br><br> ‘Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix.’<br><br> ‘Smarty! You think you're some, now, don't you? Oh, what a hat!’<br><br> ‘You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it<br> off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.’<br><br> ‘You're a liar!’<br><br> ‘You're another.’<br><br> ‘You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.’<br><br> ‘Aw--take a walk!’<br><br> ‘Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock<br> off'n your head.’<br><br> ‘Oh, of course you will.’<br><br> ‘Well I will.’<br><br> ‘Well why don't you do it then? What do you keep saying you will<br> for? Why don't you do it? It's because you're afraid.’<br><br> ‘I ain't afraid.’<br><br> ‘You are.’<br><br> ‘I ain't.’<br><br> ‘You are.’<br><br> Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently<br> they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:<br><br> ‘Get away from here!’<br><br> ‘Go away yourself!’<br><br> ‘I won't.’<br><br> ‘I won't either.’<br><br> So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both<br> shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But<br> neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and<br> flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:<br><br> ‘You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can<br> thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.’<br><br> ‘What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger<br> than he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too.’<br> [Both brothers were imaginary.]<br><br> ‘That's a lie.’<br><br> ‘Your saying so don't make it so.’<br><br> Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:<br><br> ‘I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand<br> up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.’<br><br> The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:<br><br> ‘Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.’<br><br> ‘Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.’<br><br> ‘Well, you said you'd do it--why don't you do it?’<br><br> ‘By jingo! for two cents I will do it.’<br><br> The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out<br> with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys<br> were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and<br> for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and<br> clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves<br> with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the<br> fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him<br> with his fists. ‘Holler 'nuff!’ said he.<br><br> The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.<br><br> ‘Holler 'nuff!’--and the pounding went on.<br><br> At last the stranger got out a smothered ‘'Nuff!’ and Tom let him up and<br> said:<br><br> ‘Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next<br> time.’<br><br> The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,<br> snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and<br> threatening what he would do to Tom the ‘next time he caught him out.’<br> To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and<br> as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it<br> and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like<br> an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he<br> lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the<br> enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the<br> window and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom<br> a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but<br> he said he ‘'lowed’ to ‘lay’ for that boy.<br><br> He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in<br> at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and<br> when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his<br> Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its<br> firmness.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER II<br><br> SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and<br> fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if<br> the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in<br> every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom<br> and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond<br> the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far<br> enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.<br><br> Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a<br> long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and<br> a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board<br> fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a<br> burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost<br> plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant<br> whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed<br> fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at<br> the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from<br> the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but<br> now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at<br> the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there<br> waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,<br> skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred<br> and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an<br> hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:<br><br> ‘Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.’<br><br> Jim shook his head and said:<br><br> ‘Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water<br> an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine<br> to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own<br> business--she 'lowed she'd 'tend to de whitewashin'.’<br><br> ‘Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always talks.<br> Gimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute. She won't ever<br> know.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me.<br> 'Deed she would.’<br><br> ‘She! She never licks anybody--whacks 'em over the head with her<br> thimble--and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but<br> talk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a<br> marvel. I'll give you a white alley!’<br><br> Jim began to waver.<br><br> ‘White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw.’<br><br> ‘My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful<br> 'fraid ole missis--’<br><br> ‘And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe.’<br><br> Jim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. He put down<br> his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing<br> interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he<br> was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was<br> whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with<br> a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.<br><br> But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had<br> planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys<br> would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and<br> they would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very<br> thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and<br> examined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange<br> of work, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour<br> of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and<br> gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless<br> moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,<br> magnificent inspiration.<br><br> He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in<br> sight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been<br> dreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his<br> heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and<br> giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned<br> ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As<br> he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned<br> far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp<br> and circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered<br> himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and<br> engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own<br> hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:<br><br> ‘Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!’ The headway ran almost out, and he<br> drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.<br><br> ‘Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!’ His arms straightened and stiffened<br> down his sides.<br><br> ‘Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!<br> Chow!’ His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles--for it was<br> representing a forty-foot wheel.<br><br> ‘Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!’<br> The left hand began to describe circles.<br><br> ‘Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on<br> the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling!<br> Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! lively now! Come--out with<br> your spring-line--what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump<br> with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now--let her go! Done with<br> the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!’ (trying the<br> gauge-cocks).<br><br> Tom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared<br> a moment and then said: ‘Hi-Yi! You're up a stump, ain't you!’<br><br> No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then<br> he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as<br> before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the<br> apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:<br><br> ‘Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?’<br><br> Tom wheeled suddenly and said:<br><br> ‘Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.’<br><br> ‘Say--I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of<br> course you'd druther work--wouldn't you? Course you would!’<br><br> Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:<br><br> ‘What do you call work?’<br><br> ‘Why, ain't that work?’<br><br> Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:<br><br> ‘Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom<br> Sawyer.’<br><br> ‘Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?’<br><br> The brush continued to move.<br><br> ‘Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a<br> chance to whitewash a fence every day?’<br><br> That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.<br> Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the<br> effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben<br> watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more<br> absorbed. Presently he said:<br><br> ‘Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.’<br><br> Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:<br><br> ‘No--no--I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful<br> particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it<br> was the back fence I wouldn't mind and she wouldn't. Yes, she's awful<br> particular about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon<br> there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it<br> the way it's got to be done.’<br><br> ‘No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I'd let<br> you, if you was me, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do<br> it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let<br> Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence<br> and anything was to happen to it--’<br><br> ‘Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I'll give you<br> the core of my apple.’<br><br> ‘Well, here--No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard--’<br><br> ‘I'll give you all of it!’<br><br> Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his<br> heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the<br> sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,<br> dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more<br> innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every<br> little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time<br> Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for<br> a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in<br> for a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour<br> after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a<br> poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in<br> wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part<br> of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool<br> cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a<br> glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,<br> six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a<br> dog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,<br> and a dilapidated old window sash.<br><br> He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of company--and<br> the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out of<br> whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.<br><br> Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He<br> had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely,<br> that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary<br> to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and<br> wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have<br> comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do,<br> and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And<br> this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or<br> performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing<br> Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England<br> who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a<br> daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable<br> money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn<br> it into work and then they would resign.<br><br> The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place<br> in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to<br> report.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER III<br><br> TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an<br> open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,<br> breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer<br> air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing<br> murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her<br> knitting--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her<br> lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had<br> thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at<br> seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He<br> said: ‘Mayn't I go and play now, aunt?’<br><br> ‘What, a'ready? How much have you done?’<br><br> ‘It's all done, aunt.’<br><br> ‘Tom, don't lie to me--I can't bear it.’<br><br> ‘I ain't, aunt; it is all done.’<br><br> Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for<br> herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of<br> Tom's statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and<br> not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a<br> streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She<br> said:<br><br> ‘Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a<br> mind to, Tom.’ And then she diluted the compliment by adding, ‘But it's<br> powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long and<br> play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I'll tan you.’<br><br> She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took<br> him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,<br> along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat<br> took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.<br> And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he ‘hooked’ a<br> doughnut.<br><br> Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway<br> that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and<br> the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a<br> hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties<br> and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,<br> and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general<br> thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at<br> peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his<br> black thread and getting him into trouble.<br><br> Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the<br> back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach<br> of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the<br> village, where two ‘military’ companies of boys had met for conflict,<br> according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these<br> armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two<br> great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better<br> suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence<br> and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through<br> aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and<br> hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,<br> the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the<br> necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and<br> marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.<br><br> As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new<br> girl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow<br> hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered<br> pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A<br> certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a<br> memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;<br> he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor<br> little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had<br> confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest<br> boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time<br> she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is<br> done.<br><br> He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had<br> discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and<br> began to ‘show off’ in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win<br> her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;<br> but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic<br> performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending<br> her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,<br> grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a<br> moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great<br> sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,<br> right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she<br> disappeared.<br><br> The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and<br> then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as<br> if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.<br> Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his<br> nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,<br> in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his<br> bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped<br> away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a<br> minute--only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next<br> his heart--or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in<br> anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.<br><br> He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, ‘showing<br> off,’ as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom<br> comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some<br> window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode<br> home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.<br><br> All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered ‘what<br> had got into the child.’ He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and<br> did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his<br> aunt's very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:<br><br> ‘Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it.’<br><br> ‘Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into<br> that sugar if I warn't watching you.’<br><br> Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,<br> reached for the sugar-bowl--a sort of glorying over Tom which was<br> wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and<br> broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled<br> his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a<br> word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she<br> asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be<br> nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model ‘catch it.’ He was<br> so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old<br> lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath<br> from over her spectacles. He said to himself, ‘Now it's coming!’ And the<br> next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted<br> to strike again when Tom cried out:<br><br> ‘Hold on, now, what 'er you belting me for?--Sid broke it!’<br><br> Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when<br> she got her tongue again, she only said:<br><br> ‘Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some<br> other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough.’<br><br> Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something<br> kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a<br> confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.<br> So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.<br> Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart<br> his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the<br> consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice<br> of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,<br> through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured<br> himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching<br> one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and<br> die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured<br> himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and<br> his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how<br> her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back<br> her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would<br> lie there cold and white and make no sign--a poor little sufferer, whose<br> griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of<br> these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;<br> and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,<br> and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to<br> him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any<br> worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too<br> sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced<br> in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit<br> of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness<br> out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.<br><br> He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate<br> places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river<br> invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated<br> the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could<br> only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the<br> uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.<br> He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal<br> felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she<br> cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and<br> comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?<br> This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he<br> worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and<br> varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing<br> and departed in the darkness.<br><br> About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to<br> where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon<br> his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain<br> of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the<br> fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under<br> that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him<br> down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his<br> hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.<br> And thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no shelter over his<br> homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,<br> no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And<br> thus she would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and<br> oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would<br> she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,<br> so untimely cut down?<br><br> The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy<br> calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!<br><br> The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz<br> as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound<br> as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the<br> fence and shot away in the gloom.<br><br> Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his<br> drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he<br> had any dim idea of making any ‘references to allusions,’ he thought<br> better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.<br><br> Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental<br> note of the omission.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER IV<br><br> THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful<br> village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family<br> worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid<br> courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of<br> originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of<br> the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.<br><br> Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to ‘get<br> his verses.’ Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his<br> energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the<br> Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.<br> At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,<br> but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human<br> thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took<br> his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the<br> fog:<br><br> ‘Blessed are the--a--a--’<br><br> ‘Poor’--<br><br> ‘Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--’<br><br> ‘In spirit--’<br><br> ‘In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--’<br><br> ‘Theirs--’<br><br> ‘For theirs. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom<br> of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--’<br><br> ‘Sh--’<br><br> ‘For they--a--’<br><br> ‘S, H, A--’<br><br> ‘For they S, H--Oh, I don't know what it is!’<br><br> ‘Shall!’<br><br> ‘Oh, shall! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--blessed<br> are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for they<br> shall--a--shall what? Why don't you tell me, Mary?--what do you want to<br> be so mean for?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't<br> do that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom,<br> you'll manage it--and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice.<br> There, now, that's a good boy.’<br><br> ‘All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.’<br><br> ‘Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is nice.’<br><br> ‘You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again.’<br><br> And he did ‘tackle it again’--and under the double pressure of curiosity<br> and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a<br> shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new ‘Barlow’ knife worth twelve<br> and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system<br> shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,<br> but it was a ‘sure-enough’ Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur<br> in that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a<br> weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing<br> mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the<br> cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was<br> called off to dress for Sunday-school.<br><br> Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went<br> outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he<br> dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;<br> poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen<br> and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But<br> Mary removed the towel and said:<br><br> ‘Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt<br> you.’<br><br> Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he<br> stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath<br> and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut<br> and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of<br> suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from<br> the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped<br> short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line<br> there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in<br> front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she<br> was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of<br> color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls<br> wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately<br> smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his<br> hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his<br> own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his<br> clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they were<br> simply called his ‘other clothes’--and so by that we know the size of his<br> wardrobe. The girl ‘put him to rights’ after he had dressed himself;<br> she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt<br> collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with<br> his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and<br> uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there<br> was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He<br> hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she<br> coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought<br> them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do<br> everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:<br><br> ‘Please, Tom--that's a good boy.’<br><br> So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three<br> children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole<br> heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.<br><br> Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church<br> service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,<br> and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons. The church's<br> high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;<br> the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board<br> tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step<br> and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:<br><br> ‘Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘What'll you take for her?’<br><br> ‘What'll you give?’<br><br> ‘Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.’<br><br> ‘Less see 'em.’<br><br> Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.<br> Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some<br> small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other<br> boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten<br> or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm<br> of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started<br> a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,<br> elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a<br> boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy<br> turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear<br> him say ‘Ouch!’ and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole<br> class were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came<br> to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but<br> had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each<br> got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture<br> on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten<br> blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red<br> tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent<br> gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy<br> times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and<br> application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And<br> yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it was the patient work of<br> two years--and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once<br> recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his<br> mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot<br> from that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great<br> occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)<br> had always made this boy come out and ‘spread himself.’ Only the older<br> pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work<br> long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes<br> was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so<br> great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's<br> heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple<br> of weeks. It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really<br> hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being<br> had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.<br><br> In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with<br> a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its<br> leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent<br> makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as<br> necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer<br> who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though<br> why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music<br> is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim<br> creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he<br> wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears<br> and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a<br> fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the<br> whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a<br> spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had<br> fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion<br> of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously<br> produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a<br> wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very<br> sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places<br> in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that<br> unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar<br> intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this<br> fashion:<br><br> ‘Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as<br> you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There--that<br> is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one<br> little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I<br> am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech<br> to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it<br> makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a<br> place like this, learning to do right and be good.’ And so forth and so<br> on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a<br> pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.<br><br> The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights<br> and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings<br> and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of<br> isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound<br> ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the<br> conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.<br><br> A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was<br> more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied<br> by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman<br> with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's<br> wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of<br> chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could not meet Amy<br> Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this<br> small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next<br> moment he was ‘showing off’ with all his might--cuffing boys, pulling<br> hair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to<br> fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one<br> alloy--the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden--and that<br> record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that<br> were sweeping over it now.<br><br> The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.<br> Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The<br> middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one<br> than the county judge--altogether the most august creation these children<br> had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made<br> of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,<br> too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so he had travelled,<br> and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county<br> court-house--which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these<br> reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the<br> ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of<br> their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar<br> with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music<br> to his soul to hear the whisperings:<br><br> ‘Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say--look! he's a going to<br> shake hands with him--he is shaking hands with him! By jings, don't you<br> wish you was Jeff?’<br><br> Mr. Walters fell to ‘showing off,’ with all sorts of official bustlings<br> and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging<br> directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The<br> librarian ‘showed off’--running hither and thither with his arms full of<br> books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority<br> delights in. The young lady teachers ‘showed off’--bending sweetly over<br> pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers<br> at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen<br> teachers ‘showed off’ with small scoldings and other little displays of<br> authority and fine attention to discipline--and most of the teachers, of<br> both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was<br> business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times<br> (with much seeming vexation). The little girls ‘showed off’ in various<br> ways, and the little boys ‘showed off’ with such diligence that the air<br> was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it<br> all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all<br> the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was<br> ‘showing off,’ too.<br><br> There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete,<br> and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.<br> Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been<br> around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,<br> to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.<br><br> And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with<br> nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded<br> a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not<br> expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But<br> there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they<br> were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with<br> the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from<br> headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and<br> so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the<br> judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon<br> in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that<br> suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they<br> themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to<br> Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.<br> These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a<br> guileful snake in the grass.<br><br> The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the<br> superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked<br> somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him<br> that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,<br> perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two<br> thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would<br> strain his capacity, without a doubt.<br><br> Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in<br> her face--but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was just a grain<br> troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;<br> a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was<br> jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most<br> of all (she thought).<br><br> Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath<br> would hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful<br> greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would<br> have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The<br> Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and<br> asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:<br><br> ‘Tom.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no, not Tom--it is--’<br><br> ‘Thomas.’<br><br> ‘Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very well.<br> But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't you?’<br><br> ‘Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,’ said Walters, ‘and say<br> sir. You mustn't forget your manners.’<br><br> ‘Thomas Sawyer--sir.’<br><br> ‘That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two<br> thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. And you never can<br> be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth<br> more than anything there is in the world; it's what makes great men<br> and good men; you'll be a great man and a good man yourself, some<br> day, Thomas, and then you'll look back and say, It's all owing to the<br> precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it's all owing to<br> my dear teachers that taught me to learn--it's all owing to the good<br> superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a<br> beautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have it all for my<br> own, always--it's all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will<br> say, Thomas--and you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand<br> verses--no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind telling me and<br> this lady some of the things you've learned--no, I know you wouldn't--for<br> we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names<br> of all the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us the names of the first<br> two that were appointed?’<br><br> Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,<br> now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within him. He said<br> to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest<br> question--why did the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up<br> and say:<br><br> ‘Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don't be afraid.’<br><br> Tom still hung fire.<br><br> ‘Now I know you'll tell me,’ said the lady. ‘The names of the first two<br> disciples were--’<br><br> ‘David And Goliah!’<br><br> Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER V<br><br> ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,<br> and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The<br> Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and<br> occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt<br> Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed next<br> the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window<br> and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up<br> the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;<br> the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other<br> unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,<br> smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill<br> mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much<br> the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could<br> boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the<br> new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by<br> a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all<br> the young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the vestibule<br> sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering<br> admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came<br> the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as<br> if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was<br> the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so<br> good. And besides, he had been ‘thrown up to them’ so much. His<br> white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on<br> Sundays--accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys<br> who had as snobs.<br><br> The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,<br> to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the<br> church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the<br> choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all<br> through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,<br> but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,<br> and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in<br> some foreign country.<br><br> The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a<br> peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His<br> voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a<br> certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word<br> and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:<br><br> Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry beds of ease,<br><br> Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' blood-y seas?<br><br> He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church ‘sociables’ he was<br> always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies<br> would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,<br> and ‘wall’ their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, ‘Words<br> cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal<br> earth.’<br><br> After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into<br> a bulletin-board, and read off ‘notices’ of meetings and societies and<br> things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of<br> doom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,<br> away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is<br> to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.<br><br> And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went<br> into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the<br> church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;<br> for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United<br> States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the<br> President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed<br> by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of<br> European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light<br> and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear<br> withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with<br> a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace<br> and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a<br> grateful harvest of good. Amen.<br><br> There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.<br> The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he<br> only endured it--if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;<br> he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for he was not<br> listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular<br> route over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,<br> his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered<br> additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had<br> lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by<br> calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and<br> polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with<br> the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping<br> its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they<br> had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if<br> it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's<br> hands itched to grab for it they did not dare--he believed his soul would<br> be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going<br> on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal<br> forward; and the instant the ‘Amen’ was out the fly was a prisoner of<br> war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.<br><br> The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an<br> argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and<br> yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and<br> thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly<br> worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he<br> always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything<br> else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested<br> for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the<br> assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion<br> and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead<br> them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle<br> were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the<br> principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the<br> thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,<br> if it was a tame lion.<br><br> Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.<br> Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was<br> a large black beetle with formidable jaws--a ‘pinchbug,’ he called it. It<br> was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to<br> take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went<br> floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went<br> into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,<br> unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out<br> of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in<br> the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came<br> idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the<br> quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the<br> drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around<br> it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew<br> bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly<br> snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy<br> the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,<br> and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent<br> and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin<br> descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,<br> a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards<br> away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators<br> shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and<br> hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,<br> and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a<br> craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on<br> it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his<br> fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at<br> it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But<br> he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a<br> fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close<br> to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the<br> beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony<br> and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so<br> did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew<br> down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the<br> home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was<br> but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of<br> light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang<br> into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of<br> distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.<br><br> By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with<br> suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.<br> The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all<br> possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest<br> sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of<br> unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson<br> had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole<br> congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.<br><br> Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was<br> some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety<br> in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog<br> should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in<br> him to carry it off.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VI<br><br> MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found<br> him so--because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He<br> generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,<br> it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.<br><br> Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was<br> sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.<br> He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated<br> again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he<br> began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew<br> feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly<br> he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This<br> was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a ‘starter,’ as he<br> called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that<br> argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought<br> he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.<br> Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing<br> the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or<br> three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly<br> drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.<br> But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed<br> well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable<br> spirit.<br><br> But Sid slept on unconscious.<br><br> Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.<br><br> No result from Sid.<br><br> Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then<br> swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.<br><br> Sid snored on.<br><br> Tom was aggravated. He said, ‘Sid, Sid!’ and shook him. This course<br> worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then<br> brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.<br> Tom went on groaning. Sid said:<br><br> ‘Tom! Say, Tom!’ [No response.] ‘Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,<br> Tom?’ And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.<br><br> Tom moaned out:<br><br> ‘Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.’<br><br> ‘Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.’<br><br> ‘No--never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.’<br><br> ‘But I must! Don't groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this<br> way?’<br><br> ‘Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.’<br><br> ‘Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, don't! It makes my flesh<br> crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?’<br><br> ‘I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to<br> me. When I'm gone--’<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom--oh, don't. Maybe--’<br><br> ‘I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give<br> my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to<br> town, and tell her--’<br><br> But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,<br> now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had<br> gathered quite a genuine tone.<br><br> Sid flew downstairs and said:<br><br> ‘Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!’<br><br> ‘Dying!’<br><br> ‘Yes'm. Don't wait--come quick!’<br><br> ‘Rubbage! I don't believe it!’<br><br> But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.<br> And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the<br> bedside she gasped out:<br><br> ‘You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?’<br><br> ‘Oh, auntie, I'm--’<br><br> ‘What's the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?’<br><br> ‘Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!’<br><br> The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a<br> little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:<br><br> ‘Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and<br> climb out of this.’<br><br> The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a<br> little foolish, and he said:<br><br> ‘Aunt Polly, it seemed mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my<br> tooth at all.’<br><br> ‘Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?’<br><br> ‘One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.’<br><br> ‘There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.<br> Well--your tooth is loose, but you're not going to die about that.<br> Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.’<br><br> Tom said:<br><br> ‘Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish<br> I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay<br> home from school.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd<br> get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,<br> and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your<br> outrageousness.’ By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old<br> lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop<br> and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and<br> suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling<br> by the bedpost, now.<br><br> But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after<br> breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his<br> upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable<br> way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;<br> and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and<br> homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,<br> and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain<br> which he did not feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;<br> but another boy said, ‘Sour grapes!’ and he wandered away a dismantled<br> hero.<br><br> Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry<br> Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and<br> dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless<br> and vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and<br> delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like<br> him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied<br> Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders<br> not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.<br> Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown<br> men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat<br> was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,<br> when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons<br> far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of<br> the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged<br> in the dirt when not rolled up.<br><br> Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps<br> in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to<br> school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could<br> go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it<br> suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he<br> pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring<br> and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor<br> put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything<br> that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,<br> hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.<br><br> Tom hailed the romantic outcast:<br><br> ‘Hello, Huckleberry!’<br><br> ‘Hello yourself, and see how you like it.’<br><br> ‘What's that you got?’<br><br> ‘Dead cat.’<br><br> ‘Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?’<br><br> ‘Bought him off'n a boy.’<br><br> ‘What did you give?’<br><br> ‘I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.’<br><br> ‘Where'd you get the blue ticket?’<br><br> ‘Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.’<br><br> ‘Say--what is dead cats good for, Huck?’<br><br> ‘Good for? Cure warts with.’<br><br> ‘No! Is that so? I know something that's better.’<br><br> ‘I bet you don't. What is it?’<br><br> ‘Why, spunk-water.’<br><br> ‘Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.’<br><br> ‘You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?’<br><br> ‘No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.’<br><br> ‘Who told you so!’<br><br> ‘Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny<br> told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the<br> nigger told me. There now!’<br><br> ‘Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I<br> don't know him. But I never see a nigger that wouldn't lie. Shucks!<br> Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.’<br><br> ‘Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water<br> was.’<br><br> ‘In the daytime?’<br><br> ‘Certainly.’<br><br> ‘With his face to the stump?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Least I reckon so.’<br><br> ‘Did he say anything?’<br><br> ‘I don't reckon he did. I don't know.’<br><br> ‘Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool<br> way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go all<br> by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a<br> spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump<br> and jam your hand in and say:<br><br> 'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water,<br> swaller these warts,'<br><br> and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then<br> turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.<br> Because if you speak the charm's busted.’<br><br> ‘Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner<br> done.’<br><br> ‘No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this<br> town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work<br> spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,<br> Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many<br> warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.’<br><br> ‘Yes, bean's good. I've done that.’<br><br> ‘Have you? What's your way?’<br><br> ‘You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,<br> and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig<br> a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the<br> moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece<br> that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to<br> fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the<br> wart, and pretty soon off she comes.’<br><br> ‘Yes, that's it, Huck--that's it; though when you're burying it if you<br> say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better.<br> That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and<br> most everywheres. But say--how do you cure 'em with dead cats?’<br><br> ‘Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long about<br> midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's<br> midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see<br> 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk;<br> and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em<br> and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm<br> done with ye!' That'll fetch any wart.’<br><br> ‘Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?’<br><br> ‘No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.’<br><br> ‘Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.’<br><br> ‘Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own<br> self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he<br> took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that<br> very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke<br> his arm.’<br><br> ‘Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?’<br><br> ‘Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right<br> stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when<br> they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards.’<br><br> ‘Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?’<br><br> ‘To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.’<br><br> ‘But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?’<br><br> ‘Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?--and<br> then it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't<br> reckon.’<br><br> ‘I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?’<br><br> ‘Of course--if you ain't afeard.’<br><br> ‘Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?’<br><br> ‘Yes--and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me<br> a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says<br> 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window--but don't you<br> tell.’<br><br> ‘I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but<br> I'll meow this time. Say--what's that?’<br><br> ‘Nothing but a tick.’<br><br> ‘Where'd you get him?’<br><br> ‘Out in the woods.’<br><br> ‘What'll you take for him?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. I don't want to sell him.’<br><br> ‘All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.’<br><br> ‘Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm<br> satisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me.’<br><br> ‘Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted<br> to.’<br><br> ‘Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a<br> pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.’<br><br> ‘Say, Huck--I'll give you my tooth for him.’<br><br> ‘Less see it.’<br><br> Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed<br> it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:<br><br> ‘Is it genuwyne?’<br><br> Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.<br><br> ‘Well, all right,’ said Huckleberry, ‘it's a trade.’<br><br> Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the<br> pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than<br> before.<br><br> When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in<br> briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He<br> hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like<br> alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom<br> arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The<br> interruption roused him.<br><br> ‘Thomas Sawyer!’<br><br> Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.<br><br> ‘Sir!’<br><br> ‘Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?’<br><br> Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of<br> yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric<br> sympathy of love; and by that form was the only vacant place on the<br> girls' side of the school-house. He instantly said:<br><br> ‘I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!’<br><br> The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of<br> study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his<br> mind. The master said:<br><br> ‘You--you did what?’<br><br> ‘Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.’<br><br> There was no mistaking the words.<br><br> ‘Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever<br> listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your<br> jacket.’<br><br> The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches<br> notably diminished. Then the order followed:<br><br> ‘Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.’<br><br> The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but<br> in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe<br> of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good<br> fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched<br> herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and<br> whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the<br> long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.<br><br> By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur<br> rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal<br> furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, ‘made a mouth’ at him<br> and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she<br> cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it<br> away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less<br> animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it<br> remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, ‘Please take it--I got more.’ The<br> girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw<br> something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time<br> the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began<br> to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,<br> apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt<br> to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she<br> gave in and hesitatingly whispered:<br><br> ‘Let me see it.’<br><br> Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends<br> to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's<br> interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything<br> else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:<br><br> ‘It's nice--make a man.’<br><br> The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He<br> could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;<br> she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:<br><br> ‘It's a beautiful man--now make me coming along.’<br><br> Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed<br> the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:<br><br> ‘It's ever so nice--I wish I could draw.’<br><br> ‘It's easy,’ whispered Tom, ‘I'll learn you.’<br><br> ‘Oh, will you? When?’<br><br> ‘At noon. Do you go home to dinner?’<br><br> ‘I'll stay if you will.’<br><br> ‘Good--that's a whack. What's your name?’<br><br> ‘Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.’<br><br> ‘That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me<br> Tom, will you?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from<br> the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom<br> said:<br><br> ‘Oh, it ain't anything.’<br><br> ‘Yes it is.’<br><br> ‘No it ain't. You don't want to see.’<br><br> ‘Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.’<br><br> ‘You'll tell.’<br><br> ‘No I won't--deed and deed and double deed won't.’<br><br> ‘You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?’<br><br> ‘No, I won't ever tell anybody. Now let me.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you don't want to see!’<br><br> ‘Now that you treat me so, I will see.’ And she put her small hand<br> upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in<br> earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were<br> revealed: ‘I love you.’<br><br> ‘Oh, you bad thing!’ And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and<br> looked pleased, nevertheless.<br><br> Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his<br> ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the<br> house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles<br> from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful<br> moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But<br> although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.<br><br> As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but<br> the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the<br> reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and<br> turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into<br> continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and<br> got ‘turned down,’ by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought<br> up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with<br> ostentation for months.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VII<br><br> THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas<br> wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed<br> to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.<br> There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.<br> The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed<br> the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the<br> flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a<br> shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds<br> floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible<br> but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or<br> else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.<br> His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of<br> gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively<br> the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on<br> the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that<br> amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when<br> he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and<br> made him take a new direction.<br><br> Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and<br> now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in<br> an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn<br> friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a<br> pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.<br> The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were<br> interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit<br> of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the<br> middle of it from top to bottom.<br><br> ‘Now,’ said he, ‘as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and<br> I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,<br> you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.’<br><br> ‘All right, go ahead; start him up.’<br><br> The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe<br> harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This<br> change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with<br> absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the<br> two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all<br> things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The<br> tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as<br> anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would<br> have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would<br> be twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep<br> possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too<br> strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in<br> a moment. Said he:<br><br> ‘Tom, you let him alone.’<br><br> ‘I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.’<br><br> ‘No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.’<br><br> ‘Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much.’<br><br> ‘Let him alone, I tell you.’<br><br> ‘I won't!’<br><br> ‘You shall--he's on my side of the line.’<br><br> ‘Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?’<br><br> ‘I don't care whose tick he is--he's on my side of the line, and you<br> sha'n't touch him.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I<br> blame please with him, or die!’<br><br> A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on<br> Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from<br> the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been<br> too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile<br> before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.<br> He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed<br> his bit of variety to it.<br><br> When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered<br> in her ear:<br><br> ‘Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to<br> the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the<br> lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same<br> way.’<br><br> So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with<br> another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and<br> when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they<br> sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil<br> and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising<br> house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.<br> Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:<br><br> ‘Do you love rats?’<br><br> ‘No! I hate them!’<br><br> ‘Well, I do, too--live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your<br> head with a string.’<br><br> ‘No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.’<br><br> ‘Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give<br> it back to me.’<br><br> That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs<br> against the bench in excess of contentment.<br><br> ‘Was you ever at a circus?’ said Tom.<br><br> ‘Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.’<br><br> ‘I been to the circus three or four times--lots of times. Church ain't<br> shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time.<br> I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.’<br><br> ‘Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up.’<br><br> ‘Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day, Ben<br> Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?’<br><br> ‘What's that?’<br><br> ‘Why, engaged to be married.’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Would you like to?’<br><br> ‘I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?’<br><br> ‘Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't<br> ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's<br> all. Anybody can do it.’<br><br> ‘Kiss? What do you kiss for?’<br><br> ‘Why, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.’<br><br> ‘Everybody?’<br><br> ‘Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember<br> what I wrote on the slate?’<br><br> ‘Ye--yes.’<br><br> ‘What was it?’<br><br> ‘I sha'n't tell you.’<br><br> ‘Shall I tell you?’<br><br> ‘Ye--yes--but some other time.’<br><br> ‘No, now.’<br><br> ‘No, not now--to-morrow.’<br><br> ‘Oh, no, now. Please, Becky--I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so<br> easy.’<br><br> Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about<br> her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to<br> her ear. And then he added:<br><br> ‘Now you whisper it to me--just the same.’<br><br> She resisted, for a while, and then said:<br><br> ‘You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you<br> mustn't ever tell anybody--will you, Tom? Now you won't, will you?’<br><br> ‘No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.’<br><br> He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred<br> his curls and whispered, ‘I--love--you!’<br><br> Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,<br> with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little<br> white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:<br><br> ‘Now, Becky, it's all done--all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid<br> of that--it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky.’ And he tugged at her<br> apron and the hands.<br><br> By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing<br> with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and<br> said:<br><br> ‘Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't<br> ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me,<br> ever never and forever. Will you?’<br><br> ‘No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody<br> but you--and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.’<br><br> ‘Certainly. Of course. That's part of it. And always coming to school<br> or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't<br> anybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because<br> that's the way you do when you're engaged.’<br><br> ‘It's so nice. I never heard of it before.’<br><br> ‘Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--’<br><br> The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!’<br><br> The child began to cry. Tom said:<br><br> ‘Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.’<br><br> ‘Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.’<br><br> Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and<br> turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with<br> soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was<br> up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and<br> uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping<br> she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began<br> to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle<br> with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and<br> entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with<br> her face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a<br> moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:<br><br> ‘Becky, I--I don't care for anybody but you.’<br><br> No reply--but sobs.<br><br> ‘Becky’--pleadingly. ‘Becky, won't you say something?’<br><br> More sobs.<br><br> Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,<br> and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:<br><br> ‘Please, Becky, won't you take it?’<br><br> She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over<br> the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently<br> Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she<br> flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:<br><br> ‘Tom! Come back, Tom!’<br><br> She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions<br> but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid<br> herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she<br> had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross<br> of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about<br> her to exchange sorrows with.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER VIII<br><br> TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the<br> track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed<br> a small ‘branch’ two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile<br> superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later<br> he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff<br> Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the<br> valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to<br> the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.<br> There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even<br> stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken<br> by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and<br> this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the<br> more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings<br> were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows<br> on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him<br> that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy<br> Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie<br> and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through<br> the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and<br> nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a<br> clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with<br> it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant<br> the best in the world, and been treated like a dog--like a very dog. She<br> would be sorry some day--maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only<br> die temporarily!<br><br> But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained<br> shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into<br> the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and<br> disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever so far away, into<br> unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came back any more! How<br> would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only<br> to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights<br> were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was<br> exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be<br> a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.<br> No--better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on<br> the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the<br> Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with<br> feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy<br> summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs<br> of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was<br> something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!<br> now his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable<br> splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!<br> How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,<br> black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying<br> at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear<br> at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in<br> his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson<br> sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass<br> at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,<br> with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy<br> the whisperings, ‘It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the<br> Spanish Main!’<br><br> Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from<br> home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore<br> he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.<br> He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of<br> it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He<br> put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:<br><br> ‘What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!’<br><br> Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it<br> up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides<br> were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was bound-less!<br> He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:<br><br> ‘Well, that beats anything!’<br><br> Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The<br> truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and<br> all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried<br> a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a<br> fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just<br> used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered<br> themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been<br> separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.<br> Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had<br> many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing<br> before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times<br> before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He<br> puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch<br> had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself<br> on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot<br> with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and<br> put his mouth close to this depression and called--<br><br> ‘Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,<br> doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!’<br><br> The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a<br> second and then darted under again in a fright.<br><br> ‘He dasn't tell! So it was a witch that done it. I just knowed it.’<br><br> He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he<br> gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have<br> the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a<br> patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his<br> treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing<br> when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his<br> pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:<br><br> ‘Brother, go find your brother!’<br><br> He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must<br> have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last<br> repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each<br> other.<br><br> Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green<br> aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned<br> a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,<br> disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and<br> in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,<br> with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an<br> answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way<br> and that. He said cautiously--to an imaginary company:<br><br> ‘Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.’<br><br> Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.<br> Tom called:<br><br> ‘Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?’<br><br> ‘Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that--that--’<br><br> ‘Dares to hold such language,’ said Tom, prompting--for they talked ‘by<br> the book,’ from memory.<br><br> ‘Who art thou that dares to hold such language?’<br><br> ‘I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.’<br><br> ‘Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute<br> with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!’<br><br> They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,<br> struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful<br> combat, ‘two up and two down.’ Presently Tom said:<br><br> ‘Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!’<br><br> So they ‘went it lively,’ panting and perspiring with the work. By and<br> by Tom shouted:<br><br> ‘Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?’<br><br> ‘I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of<br> it.’<br><br> ‘Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the<br> book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy<br> of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back.’<br><br> There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the<br> whack and fell.<br><br> ‘Now,’ said Joe, getting up, ‘you got to let me kill you. That's<br> fair.’<br><br> ‘Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.’<br><br> ‘Well, it's blamed mean--that's all.’<br><br> ‘Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam<br> me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be<br> Robin Hood a little while and kill me.’<br><br> This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then<br> Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to<br> bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,<br> representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,<br> gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, ‘Where this arrow<br> falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.’ Then he<br> shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle<br> and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.<br><br> The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off<br> grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern<br> civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.<br> They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than<br> President of the United States forever.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER IX<br><br> AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.<br> They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and<br> waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be<br> nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He<br> would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was<br> afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.<br> Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,<br> scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking<br> of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack<br> mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.<br> A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the<br> tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,<br> began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the<br> bed's head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody's days were numbered.<br> Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered<br> by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last<br> he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to<br> doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear<br> it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most<br> melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed<br> him. A cry of ‘Scat! you devil!’ and the crash of an empty bottle<br> against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a<br> single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping<br> along the roof of the ‘ell’ on all fours. He ‘meow'd’ with caution once<br> or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence<br> to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys<br> moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they<br> were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.<br><br> It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,<br> about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence<br> around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the<br> time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the<br> whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a<br> tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over<br> the graves, leaning for support and finding none. ‘Sacred to the memory<br> of’ So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have<br> been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.<br><br> A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the<br> spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked<br> little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the<br> pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the<br> sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the<br> protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of<br> the grave.<br><br> Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of<br> a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's<br> reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a<br> whisper:<br><br> ‘Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?’<br><br> Huckleberry whispered:<br><br> ‘I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, ain't it?’<br><br> ‘I bet it is.’<br><br> There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter<br> inwardly. Then Tom whispered:<br><br> ‘Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?’<br><br> ‘O' course he does. Least his sperrit does.’<br><br> Tom, after a pause:<br><br> ‘I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody<br> calls him Hoss.’<br><br> ‘A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead<br> people, Tom.’<br><br> This was a damper, and conversation died again.<br><br> Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:<br><br> ‘Sh!’<br><br> ‘What is it, Tom?’ And the two clung together with beating hearts.<br><br> ‘Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?’<br><br> ‘I--’<br><br> ‘There! Now you hear it.’<br><br> ‘Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?’<br><br> ‘I dono. Think they'll see us?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't<br> come.’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing<br> any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at<br> all.’<br><br> ‘I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.’<br><br> ‘Listen!’<br><br> The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled<br> sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.<br><br> ‘Look! See there!’ whispered Tom. ‘What is it?’<br><br> ‘It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.’<br><br> Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an<br> old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable<br> little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a<br> shudder:<br><br> ‘It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners!<br> Can you pray?’<br><br> ‘I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I<br> lay me down to sleep, I--'‘<br><br> ‘Sh!’<br><br> ‘What is it, Huck?’<br><br> ‘They're humans! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's<br> voice.’<br><br> ‘No--'tain't so, is it?’<br><br> ‘I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to<br> notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!’<br><br> ‘All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they<br> come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're<br> p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's<br> Injun Joe.’<br><br> ‘That's so--that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern<br> sight. What kin they be up to?’<br><br> The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the<br> grave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.<br><br> ‘Here it is,’ said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern<br> up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.<br><br> Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple<br> of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.<br> The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat<br> down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the<br> boys could have touched him.<br><br> ‘Hurry, men!’ he said, in a low voice; ‘the moon might come out at any<br> moment.’<br><br> They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no<br> noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of<br> mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon<br> the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two<br> the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with<br> their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The<br> moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.<br> The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a<br> blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large<br> spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:<br><br> ‘Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with<br> another five, or here she stays.’<br><br> ‘That's the talk!’ said Injun Joe.<br><br> ‘Look here, what does this mean?’ said the doctor. ‘You required your<br> pay in advance, and I've paid you.’<br><br> ‘Yes, and you done more than that,’ said Injun Joe, approaching the<br> doctor, who was now standing. ‘Five years ago you drove me away from<br> your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to<br> eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get<br> even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for<br> a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for<br> nothing. And now I've got you, and you got to settle, you know!’<br><br> He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.<br> The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.<br> Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:<br><br> ‘Here, now, don't you hit my pard!’ and the next moment he had grappled<br> with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,<br> trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe<br> sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter's<br> knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about<br> the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung<br> himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled<br> Potter to the earth with it--and in the same instant the half-breed saw<br> his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He<br> reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in<br> the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the<br> two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.<br><br> Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the<br> two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave<br> a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:<br><br> ‘That score is settled--damn you.’<br><br> Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's<br> open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three--four--five<br> minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed<br> upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a<br> shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and<br> then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.<br><br> ‘Lord, how is this, Joe?’ he said.<br><br> ‘It's a dirty business,’ said Joe, without moving.<br><br> ‘What did you do it for?’<br><br> ‘I! I never done it!’<br><br> ‘Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.’<br><br> Potter trembled and grew white.<br><br> ‘I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's<br> in my head yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle;<br> can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--honest, now,<br> old feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--'pon my soul and honor, I<br> never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful--and him so<br> young and promising.’<br><br> ‘Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard<br> and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering<br> like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched<br> you another awful clip--and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til<br> now.’<br><br> ‘Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I<br> did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.<br> I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but never<br> with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell,<br> Joe--that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,<br> too. Don't you remember? You won't tell, will you, Joe?’ And the<br> poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and<br> clasped his appealing hands.<br><br> ‘No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I<br> won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I<br> live.’ And Potter began to cry.<br><br> ‘Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering.<br> You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any<br> tracks behind you.’<br><br> Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed<br> stood looking after him. He muttered:<br><br> ‘If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he<br> had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so<br> far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by<br> himself--chicken-heart!’<br><br> Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the<br> lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the<br> moon's. The stillness was complete again, too.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER X<br><br> THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with<br> horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,<br> apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump<br> that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them<br> catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay<br> near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give<br> wings to their feet.<br><br> ‘If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!’ whispered<br> Tom, in short catches between breaths. ‘I can't stand it much longer.’<br><br> Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed<br> their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.<br> They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst<br> through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering<br> shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:<br><br> ‘Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?’<br><br> ‘If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.’<br><br> ‘Do you though?’<br><br> ‘Why, I know it, Tom.’<br><br> Tom thought a while, then he said:<br><br> ‘Who'll tell? We?’<br><br> ‘What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe<br> didn't hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure<br> as we're a laying here.’<br><br> ‘That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.’<br><br> ‘If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's<br> generally drunk enough.’<br><br> Tom said nothing--went on thinking. Presently he whispered:<br><br> ‘Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?’<br><br> ‘What's the reason he don't know it?’<br><br> ‘Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon<br> he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?’<br><br> ‘By hokey, that's so, Tom!’<br><br> ‘And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for him!’<br><br> ‘No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and<br> besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt<br> him over the head with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so,<br> his own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man<br> was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.’<br><br> After another reflective silence, Tom said:<br><br> ‘Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?’<br><br> ‘Tom, we got to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't<br> make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak<br> 'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take<br> and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum.’<br><br> ‘I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear<br> that we--’<br><br> ‘Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little<br> rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz they go back on you<br> anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing 'bout<br> a big thing like this. And blood.’<br><br> Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;<br> the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.<br> He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a<br> little fragment of ‘red keel’ out of his pocket, got the moon on<br> his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow<br> down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the<br> pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]<br><br> ‘Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They<br> wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.’<br><br> Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and<br> the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and<br> was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:<br><br> ‘Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on<br> it.’<br><br> ‘What's verdigrease?’<br><br> ‘It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once--you'll<br> see.’<br><br> So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked<br> the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after<br> many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his<br> little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and<br> an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the<br> wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters<br> that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown<br> away.<br><br> A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined<br> building, now, but they did not notice it.<br><br> ‘Tom,’ whispered Huckleberry, ‘does this keep us from ever<br> telling--always?’<br><br> ‘Of course it does. It don't make any difference what happens, we got<br> to keep mum. We'd drop down dead--don't you know that?’<br><br> ‘Yes, I reckon that's so.’<br><br> They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up<br> a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. The boys<br> clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.<br><br> ‘Which of us does he mean?’ gasped Huckleberry.<br><br> ‘I dono--peep through the crack. Quick!’<br><br> ‘No, you, Tom!’<br><br> ‘I can't--I can't do it, Huck!’<br><br> ‘Please, Tom. There 'tis again!’<br><br> ‘Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!’ whispered Tom. ‘I know his voice. It's Bull<br> Harbison.’ *<br><br> [* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of<br> him as ‘Harbison's Bull,’ but a son or a dog of that name was ‘Bull<br> Harbison.’]<br><br> ‘Oh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet<br> anything it was a stray dog.’<br><br> The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.<br><br> ‘Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!’ whispered Huckleberry. ‘Do,<br> Tom!’<br><br> Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His<br> whisper was hardly audible when he said:<br><br> ‘Oh, Huck, its a stray dog!’<br><br> ‘Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?’<br><br> ‘Huck, he must mean us both--we're right together.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout<br> where I'll go to. I been so wicked.’<br><br> ‘Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a<br> feller's told not to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a<br> tried--but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time,<br> I lay I'll just waller in Sunday-schools!’ And Tom began to snuffle a<br> little.<br><br> ‘You bad!’ and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. ‘Consound it, Tom<br> Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh, lordy,<br> lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.’<br><br> Tom choked off and whispered:<br><br> ‘Look, Hucky, look! He's got his back to us!’<br><br> Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.<br><br> ‘Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?’<br><br> ‘Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you<br> know. Now who can he mean?’<br><br> The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.<br><br> ‘Sh! What's that?’ he whispered.<br><br> ‘Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it's somebody snoring, Tom.’<br><br> ‘That is it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?’<br><br> ‘I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep<br> there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts<br> things when he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to<br> this town any more.’<br><br> The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.<br><br> ‘Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?’<br><br> ‘I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!’<br><br> Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the<br> boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their<br> heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,<br> the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the<br> snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man<br> moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was<br> Muff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,<br> when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,<br> through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance<br> to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night<br> air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few<br> feet of where Potter was lying, and facing Potter, with his nose<br> pointing heavenward.<br><br> ‘Oh, geeminy, it's him!’ exclaimed both boys, in a breath.<br><br> ‘Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's<br> house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come<br> in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there<br> ain't anybody dead there yet.’<br><br> ‘Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall<br> in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?’<br><br> ‘Yes, but she ain't dead. And what's more, she's getting better, too.’<br><br> ‘All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff<br> Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about<br> these kind of things, Huck.’<br><br> Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window<br> the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and<br> fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He<br> was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for<br> an hour.<br><br> When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the<br> light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not<br> been called--persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled<br> him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,<br> feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had<br> finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted<br> eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill<br> to the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it<br> was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into<br> silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.<br><br> After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in<br> the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt<br> wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;<br> and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs<br> with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.<br> This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now<br> than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform<br> over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that<br> he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble<br> confidence.<br><br> He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward<br> Sid; and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was<br> unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,<br> along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the<br> air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to<br> trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his<br> desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony<br> stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.<br> His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time<br> he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with<br> a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal<br> sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!<br><br> This final feather broke the camel's back.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XI<br><br> CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified<br> with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;<br> the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,<br> with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave<br> holi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of<br> him if he had not.<br><br> A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been<br> recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter--so the story ran. And<br> it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself<br> in the ‘branch’ about one or two o'clock in the morning, and that Potter<br> had at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances, especially the washing<br> which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had<br> been ransacked for this ‘murderer’ (the public are not slow in the<br> matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he<br> could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every<br> direction, and the Sheriff ‘was confident’ that he would be captured<br> before night.<br><br> All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak<br> vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not<br> a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,<br> unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he<br> wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.<br> It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched<br> his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry's. Then both looked<br> elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their<br> mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly<br> spectacle before them.<br><br> ‘Poor fellow!’ ‘Poor young fellow!’ ‘This ought to be a lesson to grave<br> robbers!’ ‘Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!’ This was the<br> drift of remark; and the minister said, ‘It was a judgment; His hand is<br> here.’<br><br> Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid<br> face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,<br> and voices shouted, ‘It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!’<br><br> ‘Who? Who?’ from twenty voices.<br><br> ‘Muff Potter!’<br><br> ‘Hallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!’<br><br> People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't<br> trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.<br><br> ‘Infernal impudence!’ said a bystander; ‘wanted to come and take a quiet<br> look at his work, I reckon--didn't expect any company.’<br><br> The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously<br> leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was haggard, and<br> his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the<br> murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands<br> and burst into tears.<br><br> ‘I didn't do it, friends,’ he sobbed; ‘'pon my word and honor I never<br> done it.’<br><br> ‘Who's accused you?’ shouted a voice.<br><br> This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around<br> him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and<br> exclaimed:<br><br> ‘Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never--’<br><br> ‘Is that your knife?’ and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.<br><br> Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the<br> ground. Then he said:<br><br> ‘Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get--’ He shuddered; then<br> waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, ‘Tell 'em,<br> Joe, tell 'em--it ain't any use any more.’<br><br> Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the<br> stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every<br> moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head,<br> and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had<br> finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to<br> break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and<br> vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and<br> it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.<br><br> ‘Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?’ somebody<br> said.<br><br> ‘I couldn't help it--I couldn't help it,’ Potter moaned. ‘I wanted to<br> run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here.’ And he fell to<br> sobbing again.<br><br> Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes<br> afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the<br> lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that<br> Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most<br> balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could<br> not take their fascinated eyes from his face.<br><br> They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should<br> offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.<br><br> Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in<br> a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering<br> crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy<br> circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were<br> disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:<br><br> ‘It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.’<br><br> Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as<br> much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:<br><br> ‘Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me<br> awake half the time.’<br><br> Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.<br><br> ‘It's a bad sign,’ said Aunt Polly, gravely. ‘What you got on your mind,<br> Tom?’<br><br> ‘Nothing. Nothing 't I know of.’ But the boy's hand shook so that he<br> spilled his coffee.<br><br> ‘And you do talk such stuff,’ Sid said. ‘Last night you said, 'It's<br> blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over.<br> And you said, 'Don't torment me so--I'll tell!' Tell what? What is it<br> you'll tell?’<br><br> Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have<br> happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face<br> and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:<br><br> ‘Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night<br> myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.’<br><br> Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.<br> Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after<br> that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every<br> night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently<br> slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good<br> while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place<br> again. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew<br> irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of<br> Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.<br><br> It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding<br> inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.<br> Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,<br> though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;<br> he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was strange;<br> and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion<br> to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,<br> but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and<br> ceased to torture Tom's conscience.<br><br> Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his<br> opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such<br> small comforts through to the ‘murderer’ as he could get hold of. The<br> jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge<br> of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it<br> was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's<br> conscience.<br><br> The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride<br> him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character<br> that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the<br> matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his<br> inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery<br> that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in<br> the courts at present.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XII<br><br> ONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret<br> troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest<br> itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had<br> struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to ‘whistle her down the<br> wind,’ but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's<br> house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she<br> should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an<br> interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there<br> was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;<br> there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to<br> try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who<br> are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of<br> producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in<br> these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a<br> fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,<br> but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the<br> ‘Health’ periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance<br> they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the ‘rot’ they<br> contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,<br> and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and<br> what frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing<br> to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her<br> health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they<br> had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest<br> as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered<br> together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed<br> with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with<br> ‘hell following after.’ But she never suspected that she was not an<br> angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering<br> neighbors.<br><br> The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall<br> to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the<br> wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed<br> him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she<br> rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she<br> sweated his soul clean and ‘the yellow stains of it came through his<br> pores’--as Tom said.<br><br> Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and<br> pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and<br> plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the<br> water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his<br> capacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every day with quack<br> cure-alls.<br><br> Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase<br> filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must<br> be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first<br> time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with<br> gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water<br> treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.<br> She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the<br> result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;<br> for the ‘indifference’ was broken up. The boy could not have shown a<br> wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.<br><br> Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be<br> romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have<br> too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he<br> thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of<br> professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he<br> became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and<br> quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings<br> to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle<br> clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it<br> did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in<br> the sitting-room floor with it.<br><br> One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow<br> cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging<br> for a taste. Tom said:<br><br> ‘Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter.’<br><br> But Peter signified that he did want it.<br><br> ‘You better make sure.’<br><br> Peter was sure.<br><br> ‘Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't<br> anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't<br> blame anybody but your own self.’<br><br> Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down<br> the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then<br> delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging<br> against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next<br> he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,<br> with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his<br> unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again<br> spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time<br> to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,<br> and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots<br> with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over<br> her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.<br><br> ‘Tom, what on earth ails that cat?’<br><br> ‘I don't know, aunt,’ gasped the boy.<br><br> ‘Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?’<br><br> ‘Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a<br> good time.’<br><br> ‘They do, do they?’ There was something in the tone that made Tom<br> apprehensive.<br><br> ‘Yes'm. That is, I believe they do.’<br><br> ‘You do?’<br><br> ‘Yes'm.’<br><br> The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized<br> by anxiety. Too late he divined her ‘drift.’ The handle of the telltale<br> tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it<br> up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual<br> handle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.<br><br> ‘Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?’<br><br> ‘I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn't any aunt.’<br><br> ‘Hadn't any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?’<br><br> ‘Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a<br> roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a<br> human!’<br><br> Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in<br> a new light; what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy, too.<br> She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she<br> put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:<br><br> ‘I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it did do you good.’<br><br> Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping<br> through his gravity.<br><br> ‘I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It<br> done him good, too. I never see him get around so since--’<br><br> ‘Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try<br> and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any<br> more medicine.’<br><br> Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing<br> had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,<br> he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his<br> comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to<br> be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking--down the road.<br> Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed<br> a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom<br> accosted him; and ‘led up’ warily to opportunities for remark about<br> Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and<br> watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the<br> owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks<br> ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered<br> the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed<br> in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he<br> was out, and ‘going on’ like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,<br> jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,<br> standing on his head--doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,<br> and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher<br> was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never<br> looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?<br> He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping<br> around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,<br> broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and<br> fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting her--and<br> she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: ‘Mf! some<br> people think they're mighty smart--always showing off!’<br><br> Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and<br> crestfallen.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIII<br><br> TOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a<br> forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out<br> what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried<br> to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing<br> would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame<br> him for the consequences--why shouldn't they? What right had the<br> friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would<br> lead a life of crime. There was no choice.<br><br> By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to<br> ‘take up’ tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he<br> should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very<br> hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold<br> world, he must submit--but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and<br> fast.<br><br> Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe<br> Harper--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his<br> heart. Plainly here were ‘two souls with but a single thought.’ Tom,<br> wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about<br> a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by<br> roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping<br> that Joe would not forget him.<br><br> But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going<br> to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother<br> had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and<br> knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished<br> him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but<br> succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her<br> poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.<br><br> As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand<br> by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved<br> them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for<br> being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,<br> some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he<br> conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of<br> crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.<br><br> Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River<br> was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,<br> with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a<br> rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further<br> shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's<br> Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a<br> matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,<br> and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was<br> indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the<br> river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which was<br> midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.<br> Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal<br> in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws. And before the<br> afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of<br> spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would ‘hear something.’ All<br> who got this vague hint were cautioned to ‘be mum and wait.’<br><br> About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,<br> and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the<br> meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay<br> like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the<br> quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under<br> the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the<br> same way. Then a guarded voice said:<br><br> ‘Who goes there?’<br><br> ‘Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.’<br><br> ‘Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.’ Tom<br> had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.<br><br> ‘'Tis well. Give the countersign.’<br><br> Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the<br> brooding night:<br><br> ‘Blood!’<br><br> Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,<br> tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was<br> an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked<br> the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.<br><br> The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn<br> himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a<br> skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought<br> a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or<br> ‘chewed’ but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it<br> would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;<br> matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering<br> upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily<br> thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing<br> adventure of it, saying, ‘Hist!’ every now and then, and suddenly<br> halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;<br> and giving orders in dismal whispers that if ‘the foe’ stirred, to ‘let<br> him have it to the hilt,’ because ‘dead men tell no tales.’ They knew<br> well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying<br> in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their<br> conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.<br><br> They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and<br> Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded<br> arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:<br><br> ‘Luff, and bring her to the wind!’<br><br> ‘Aye-aye, sir!’<br><br> ‘Steady, steady-y-y-y!’<br><br> ‘Steady it is, sir!’<br><br> ‘Let her go off a point!’<br><br> ‘Point it is, sir!’<br><br> As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream<br> it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for<br> ‘style,’ and were not intended to mean anything in particular.<br><br> ‘What sail's she carrying?’<br><br> ‘Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.’<br><br> ‘Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of<br> ye--foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!’<br><br> ‘Aye-aye, sir!’<br><br> ‘Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! now my hearties!’<br><br> ‘Aye-aye, sir!’<br><br> ‘Hellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,<br> port! Now, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!’<br><br> ‘Steady it is, sir!’<br><br> The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head<br> right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was<br> not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during<br> the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before<br> the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,<br> peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,<br> unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black<br> Avenger stood still with folded arms, ‘looking his last’ upon the scene<br> of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing ‘she’ could see<br> him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless<br> heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but<br> a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond<br> eye-shot of the village, and so he ‘looked his last’ with a broken and<br> satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and<br> they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift<br> them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in<br> time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the<br> raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,<br> and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part<br> of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they<br> spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;<br> but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as<br> became outlaws.<br><br> They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps<br> within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in<br> the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn ‘pone’ stock<br> they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,<br> free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,<br> far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to<br> civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy<br> glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the<br> varnished foliage and festooning vines.<br><br> When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance<br> of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,<br> filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but<br> they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting<br> campfire.<br><br> ‘Ain't it gay?’ said Joe.<br><br> ‘It's nuts!’ said Tom. ‘What would the boys say if they could see us?’<br><br> ‘Say? Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!’<br><br> ‘I reckon so,’ said Huckleberry; ‘anyways, I'm suited. I don't want<br> nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally--and here<br> they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.’<br><br> ‘It's just the life for me,’ said Tom. ‘You don't have to get up,<br> mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that<br> blame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do anything, Joe,<br> when he's ashore, but a hermit he has to be praying considerable, and<br> then he don't have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.’<br><br> ‘Oh yes, that's so,’ said Joe, ‘but I hadn't thought much about it, you<br> know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.’<br><br> ‘You see,’ said Tom, ‘people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like<br> they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And<br> a hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put<br> sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--’<br><br> ‘What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?’ inquired Huck.<br><br> ‘I dono. But they've got to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do<br> that if you was a hermit.’<br><br> ‘Dern'd if I would,’ said Huck.<br><br> ‘Well, what would you do?’<br><br> ‘I dono. But I wouldn't do that.’<br><br> ‘Why, Huck, you'd have to. How'd you get around it?’<br><br> ‘Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away.’<br><br> ‘Run away! Well, you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be<br> a disgrace.’<br><br> The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished<br> gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with<br> tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of<br> fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The<br> other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to<br> acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:<br><br> ‘What does pirates have to do?’<br><br> Tom said:<br><br> ‘Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get the<br> money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts<br> and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make 'em walk a<br> plank.’<br><br> ‘And they carry the women to the island,’ said Joe; ‘they don't kill the<br> women.’<br><br> ‘No,’ assented Tom, ‘they don't kill the women--they're too noble. And<br> the women's always beautiful, too.<br><br> ‘And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver<br> and di'monds,’ said Joe, with enthusiasm.<br><br> ‘Who?’ said Huck.<br><br> ‘Why, the pirates.’<br><br> Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.<br><br> ‘I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate,’ said he, with a<br> regretful pathos in his voice; ‘but I ain't got none but these.’<br><br> But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,<br> after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand<br> that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for<br> wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.<br><br> Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the<br> eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the<br> Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.<br> The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had<br> more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,<br> and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them<br> kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at<br> all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they<br> might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at<br> once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep--but an<br> intruder came, now, that would not ‘down.’ It was conscience. They began<br> to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and<br> next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.<br> They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had<br> purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not<br> to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the<br> end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking<br> sweetmeats was only ‘hooking,’ while taking bacon and hams and such<br> valuables was plain simple stealing--and there was a command against that<br> in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in<br> the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the<br> crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously<br> inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIV<br><br> WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and<br> rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool<br> gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the<br> deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not<br> a sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood<br> upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,<br> and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck<br> still slept.<br><br> Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently<br> the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray<br> of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life<br> manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going<br> to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came<br> crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air<br> from time to time and ‘sniffing around,’ then proceeding again--for he<br> was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own<br> accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,<br> by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to<br> go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its<br> curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and<br> began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that<br> he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a<br> doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,<br> from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled<br> manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,<br> and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed<br> the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and<br> said, ‘Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your<br> children's alone,’ and she took wing and went off to see about it--which<br> did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was<br> credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity<br> more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and<br> Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body<br> and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A<br> catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled<br> out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then<br> a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig<br> almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the<br> strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow<br> of the ‘fox’ kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to<br> inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never<br> seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.<br> All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight<br> pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few<br> butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.<br><br> Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with<br> a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and<br> tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white<br> sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the<br> distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a<br> slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only<br> gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge<br> between them and civilization.<br><br> They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and<br> ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a<br> spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak<br> or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood<br> charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe<br> was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a<br> minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in<br> their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time<br> to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,<br> a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a<br> family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for<br> no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the<br> quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better<br> he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,<br> open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.<br><br> They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,<br> and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They<br> tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,<br> among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the<br> ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came<br> upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.<br><br> They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be<br> astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles<br> long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to<br> was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards<br> wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle<br> of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to<br> stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw<br> themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,<br> and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,<br> and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.<br> They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This<br> took dim shape, presently--it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the<br> Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they<br> were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak<br> his thought.<br><br> For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar<br> sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a<br> clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound<br> became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,<br> glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There<br> was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came<br> floating down out of the distance.<br><br> ‘What is it!’ exclaimed Joe, under his breath.<br><br> ‘I wonder,’ said Tom in a whisper.<br><br> ‘'Tain't thunder,’ said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, ‘becuz thunder--’<br><br> ‘Hark!’ said Tom. ‘Listen--don't talk.’<br><br> They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom<br> troubled the solemn hush.<br><br> ‘Let's go and see.’<br><br> They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They<br> parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little<br> steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the<br> current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great<br> many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood<br> of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in<br> them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the<br> ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same<br> dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.<br><br> ‘I know now!’ exclaimed Tom; ‘somebody's drownded!’<br><br> ‘That's it!’ said Huck; ‘they done that last summer, when Bill Turner<br> got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes<br> him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put<br> quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody<br> that's drownded, they'll float right there and stop.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I've heard about that,’ said Joe. ‘I wonder what makes the bread<br> do that.’<br><br> ‘Oh, it ain't the bread, so much,’ said Tom; ‘I reckon it's mostly what<br> they say over it before they start it out.’<br><br> ‘But they don't say anything over it,’ said Huck. ‘I've seen 'em and<br> they don't.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's funny,’ said Tom. ‘But maybe they say it to themselves. Of<br> course they do. Anybody might know that.’<br><br> The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because<br> an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not<br> be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such<br> gravity.<br><br> ‘By jings, I wish I was over there, now,’ said Joe.<br><br> ‘I do too’ said Huck ‘I'd give heaps to know who it is.’<br><br> The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought<br> flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:<br><br> ‘Boys, I know who's drownded--it's us!’<br><br> They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they<br> were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;<br> tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor<br> lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being<br> indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,<br> and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was<br> concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.<br><br> As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business<br> and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were<br> jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble<br> they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then<br> fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;<br> and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were<br> gratifying to look upon--from their point of view. But when the shadows<br> of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing<br> into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The<br> excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts<br> of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as<br> much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a<br> sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a<br> roundabout ‘feeler’ as to how the others might look upon a return to<br> civilization--not right now, but--<br><br> Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined<br> in with Tom, and the waverer quickly ‘explained,’ and was glad to get<br> out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness<br> clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to<br> rest for the moment.<br><br> As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.<br> Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,<br> watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,<br> and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung<br> by the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders<br> of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed<br> to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something<br> upon each of these with his ‘red keel’; one he rolled up and put in his<br> jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a<br> little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain<br> schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them a lump of<br> chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind<br> of marbles known as a ‘sure 'nough crystal.’ Then he tiptoed his way<br> cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and<br> straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XV<br><br> A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward<br> the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway<br> over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out<br> confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering<br> upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had<br> expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till<br> he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket<br> pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,<br> following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten<br> o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the<br> ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything<br> was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching<br> with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes<br> and climbed into the skiff that did ‘yawl’ duty at the boat's stern. He<br> laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.<br><br> Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to ‘cast<br> off.’ A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up,<br> against the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in<br> his success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night. At<br> the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and<br> Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards<br> downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.<br><br> He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his<br> aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the ‘ell,’ and looked<br> in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There<br> sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together,<br> talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the<br> door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then<br> he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing<br> cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might<br> squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,<br> warily.<br><br> ‘What makes the candle blow so?’ said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. ‘Why,<br> that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange<br> things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid.’<br><br> Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and ‘breathed’<br> himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his<br> aunt's foot.<br><br> ‘But as I was saying,’ said Aunt Polly, ‘he warn't bad, so to say--only<br> mischeevous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't<br> any more responsible than a colt. He never meant any harm, and he was<br> the best-hearted boy that ever was’--and she began to cry.<br><br> ‘It was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to<br> every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he<br> could be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking<br> that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because<br> it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,<br> never, poor abused boy!’ And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would<br> break.<br><br> ‘I hope Tom's better off where he is,’ said Sid, ‘but if he'd been<br> better in some ways--’<br><br> ‘Sid!’ Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not<br> see it. ‘Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take care<br> of him--never you trouble yourself, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't<br> know how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a<br> comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most.’<br><br> ‘The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of<br> the Lord! But it's so hard--Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe<br> busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.<br> Little did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug<br> him and bless him for it.’<br><br> ‘Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just<br> exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took<br> and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would<br> tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my<br> thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now.<br> And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--’<br><br> But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely<br> down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than<br> anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word<br> for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself<br> than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief<br> to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy--and<br> the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his<br> nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.<br><br> He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was<br> conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;<br> then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing<br> lads had promised that the village should ‘hear something’ soon; the<br> wise-heads had ‘put this and that together’ and decided that the lads<br> had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,<br> presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the<br> Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village--and then hope<br> perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home<br> by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the<br> bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must<br> have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would<br> otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies<br> continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the<br> funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.<br><br> Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a<br> mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's<br> arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was<br> tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid<br> snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.<br><br> Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,<br> and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,<br> that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.<br><br> He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making<br> broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and<br> turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her<br> sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the<br> candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full<br> of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the<br> candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.<br> His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark<br> hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and<br> straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.<br><br> He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large<br> there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was<br> tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and<br> slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped<br> into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a<br> mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself<br> stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for<br> this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture<br> the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore<br> legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be<br> made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and<br> entered the woods.<br><br> He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep<br> awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far<br> spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the<br> island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the<br> great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A<br> little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and<br> heard Joe say:<br><br> ‘No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He<br> knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that<br> sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?’<br><br> ‘Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?’<br><br> ‘Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't<br> back here to breakfast.’<br><br> ‘Which he is!’ exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping<br> grandly into camp.<br><br> A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the<br> boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.<br> They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.<br> Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the<br> other pirates got ready to fish and explore.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVI<br><br> AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.<br> They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft<br> place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes<br> they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly<br> round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a<br> famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.<br><br> After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and<br> chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until<br> they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal<br> water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their<br> legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.<br> And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each<br> other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with<br> averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and<br> struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all<br> went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,<br> sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.<br><br> When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,<br> hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by<br> break for the water again and go through the original performance once<br> more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented<br> flesh-colored ‘tights’ very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and<br> had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest<br> post to his neighbor.<br><br> Next they got their marbles and played ‘knucks’ and ‘ringtaw’ and<br> ‘keeps’ till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another<br> swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off<br> his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his<br> ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the<br> protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he<br> had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to<br> rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the ‘dumps,’ and<br> fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay<br> drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing ‘BECKY’ in the sand with<br> his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his<br> weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He<br> erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving<br> the other boys together and joining them.<br><br> But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so<br> homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay<br> very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,<br> but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready<br> to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he<br> would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:<br><br> ‘I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore<br> it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light<br> on a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?’<br><br> But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.<br> Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was<br> discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking<br> very gloomy. Finally he said:<br><br> ‘Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome.’<br><br> ‘Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by,’ said Tom. ‘Just think of the<br> fishing that's here.’<br><br> ‘I don't care for fishing. I want to go home.’<br><br> ‘But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere.’<br><br> ‘Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there<br> ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home.’<br><br> ‘Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I do want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one. I<br> ain't any more baby than you are.’ And Joe snuffled a little.<br><br> ‘Well, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck? Poor<br> thing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,<br> don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?’<br><br> Huck said, ‘Y-e-s’--without any heart in it.<br><br> ‘I'll never speak to you again as long as I live,’ said Joe, rising.<br> ‘There now!’ And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.<br><br> ‘Who cares!’ said Tom. ‘Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get<br> laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't crybabies. We'll<br> stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get<br> along without him, per'aps.’<br><br> But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly<br> on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying<br> Joe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.<br> Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the<br> Illinois shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck<br> could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:<br><br> ‘I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now<br> it'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom.’<br><br> ‘I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.’<br><br> ‘Tom, I better go.’<br><br> ‘Well, go 'long--who's hendering you.’<br><br> Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:<br><br> ‘Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you<br> when we get to shore.’<br><br> ‘Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all.’<br><br> Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a<br> strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along<br> too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It<br> suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made<br> one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,<br> yelling:<br><br> ‘Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!’<br><br> They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they<br> were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till<br> at last they saw the ‘point’ he was driving at, and then they set up a<br> warwhoop of applause and said it was ‘splendid!’ and said if he had<br> told them at first, they wouldn't have started away. He made a plausible<br> excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret<br> would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had<br> meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.<br><br> The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,<br> chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the<br> genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to<br> learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to<br> try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never<br> smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they ‘bit’ the<br> tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.<br><br> Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,<br> charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,<br> and they gagged a little, but Tom said:<br><br> ‘Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt long<br> ago.’<br><br> ‘So would I,’ said Joe. ‘It's just nothing.’<br><br> ‘Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish<br> I could do that; but I never thought I could,’ said Tom.<br><br> ‘That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk just<br> that way--haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't.’<br><br> ‘Yes--heaps of times,’ said Huck.<br><br> ‘Well, I have too,’ said Tom; ‘oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the<br> slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and<br> Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember,<br> Huck, 'bout me saying that?’<br><br> ‘Yes, that's so,’ said Huck. ‘That was the day after I lost a white<br> alley. No, 'twas the day before.’<br><br> ‘There--I told you so,’ said Tom. ‘Huck recollects it.’<br><br> ‘I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,’ said Joe. ‘I don't feel<br> sick.’<br><br> ‘Neither do I,’ said Tom. ‘I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff<br> Thatcher couldn't.’<br><br> ‘Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him<br> try it once. He'd see!’<br><br> ‘I bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle<br> it once.’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't I!’ said Joe. ‘Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more<br> do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch him.’<br><br> ‘'Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.’<br><br> ‘So do I.’<br><br> ‘Say--boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're<br> around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.'<br> And you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll<br> say, 'Yes, I got my old pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain't<br> very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if it's strong<br> enough.' And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as<br> ca'm, and then just see 'em look!’<br><br> ‘By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was now!’<br><br> ‘So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating,<br> won't they wish they'd been along?’<br><br> ‘Oh, I reckon not! I'll just bet they will!’<br><br> So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and<br> grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously<br> increased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting<br> fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues<br> fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their<br> throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings<br> followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,<br> now. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both<br> fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and<br> main. Joe said feebly:<br><br> ‘I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.’<br><br> Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:<br><br> ‘I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring.<br> No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it.’<br><br> So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,<br> and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both<br> very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had<br> had any trouble they had got rid of it.<br><br> They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,<br> and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare<br> theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they ate<br> at dinner had disagreed with them.<br><br> About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding<br> oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys<br> huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of<br> the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was<br> stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.<br> Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the<br> blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that<br> vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by<br> another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came<br> sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting<br> breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit<br> of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned<br> night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and<br> distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,<br> startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling<br> down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A<br> sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the<br> flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the<br> forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops<br> right over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick<br> gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.<br><br> ‘Quick! boys, go for the tent!’ exclaimed Tom.<br><br> They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no<br> two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through<br> the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after<br> another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching<br> rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the<br> ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the<br> booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one<br> they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,<br> and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something<br> to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so<br> furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest<br> rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its<br> fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each<br> others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter<br> of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its<br> highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed<br> in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless<br> distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the<br> driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on<br> the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting<br> veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight<br> and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging<br> thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,<br> and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort<br> that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to<br> the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one<br> and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be<br> out in.<br><br> But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and<br> weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The<br> boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still<br> something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter<br> of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were<br> not under it when the catastrophe happened.<br><br> Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but<br> heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against<br> rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and<br> chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently<br> discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had<br> been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from<br> the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they<br> patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under<br> sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they<br> piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were<br> gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,<br> and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their<br> midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep<br> on, anywhere around.<br><br> As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over<br> them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got<br> scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After<br> the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once<br> more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as<br> he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or<br> anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of<br> cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was<br> to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.<br> They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were<br> stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many<br> zebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went tearing through<br> the woods to attack an English settlement.<br><br> By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each<br> other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each<br> other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely<br> satisfactory one.<br><br> They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now<br> a difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of<br> hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple<br> impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other<br> process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished<br> they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such<br> show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and<br> took their whiff as it passed, in due form.<br><br> And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had<br> gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without<br> having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to<br> be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high<br> promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,<br> with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were<br> prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been<br> in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to<br> smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at<br> present.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVII<br><br> BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday<br> afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were being put into<br> mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed<br> the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.<br> The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked<br> little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to<br> the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them<br> up.<br><br> In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted<br> schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing<br> there to comfort her. She soliloquized:<br><br> ‘Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got<br> anything now to remember him by.’ And she choked back a little sob.<br><br> Presently she stopped, and said to herself:<br><br> ‘It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say<br> that--I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll<br> never, never, never see him any more.’<br><br> This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling<br> down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls--playmates of Tom's<br> and Joe's--came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking<br> in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw<br> him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful<br> prophecy, as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker pointed out<br> the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added<br> something like ‘and I was a-standing just so--just as I am now, and as if<br> you was him--I was as close as that--and he smiled, just this way--and then<br> something seemed to go all over me, like--awful, you know--and I never<br> thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!’<br><br> Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and<br> many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or<br> less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided<br> who did see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,<br> the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,<br> and were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had<br> no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the<br> remembrance:<br><br> ‘Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.’<br><br> But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,<br> and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,<br> still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.<br><br> When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell<br> began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still<br> Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush<br> that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment<br> in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there<br> was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses<br> as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None<br> could remember when the little church had been so full before. There<br> was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly<br> entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in<br> deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose<br> reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.<br> There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled<br> sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving<br> hymn was sung, and the text followed: ‘I am the Resurrection and the<br> Life.’<br><br> As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the<br> graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that<br> every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang<br> in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always<br> before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor<br> boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the<br> departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the<br> people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes<br> were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had<br> seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation<br> became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last<br> the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus<br> of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and<br> crying in the pulpit.<br><br> There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later<br> the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above<br> his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair<br> of eyes followed the minister's, and then almost with one impulse the<br> congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up<br> the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,<br> sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery<br> listening to their own funeral sermon!<br><br> Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored<br> ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while<br> poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what<br> to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and<br> started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:<br><br> ‘Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck.’<br><br> ‘And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!’ And<br> the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing<br> capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.<br><br> Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: ‘Praise God from<br> whom all blessings flow--sing!--and put your hearts in it!’<br><br> And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and<br> while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the<br> envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the<br> proudest moment of his life.<br><br> As the ‘sold’ congregation trooped out they said they would almost be<br> willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that<br> once more.<br><br> Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to Aunt Polly's varying<br> moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which<br> expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVIII<br><br> THAT was Tom's great secret--the scheme to return home with his brother<br> pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the<br> Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles<br> below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town<br> till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys<br> and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of<br> invalided benches.<br><br> At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to<br> Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of<br> talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:<br><br> ‘Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody<br> suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you<br> could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over<br> on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a<br> hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.’<br><br> ‘Yes, you could have done that, Tom,’ said Mary; ‘and I believe you<br> would if you had thought of it.’<br><br> ‘Would you, Tom?’ said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. ‘Say,<br> now, would you, if you'd thought of it?’<br><br> ‘I--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.’<br><br> ‘Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,’ said Aunt Polly, with a grieved<br> tone that discomforted the boy. ‘It would have been something if you'd<br> cared enough to think of it, even if you didn't do it.’<br><br> ‘Now, auntie, that ain't any harm,’ pleaded Mary; ‘it's only Tom's giddy<br> way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.’<br><br> ‘More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and<br> done it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late,<br> and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so<br> little.’<br><br> ‘Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,’ said Tom.<br><br> ‘I'd know it better if you acted more like it.’<br><br> ‘I wish now I'd thought,’ said Tom, with a repentant tone; ‘but I dreamt<br> about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?’<br><br> ‘It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing. What<br> did you dream?’<br><br> ‘Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the<br> bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.’<br><br> ‘Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take even<br> that much trouble about us.’<br><br> ‘And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.’<br><br> ‘Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?’<br><br> ‘Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now.’<br><br> ‘Well, try to recollect--can't you?’<br><br> ‘Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--’<br><br> ‘Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!’<br><br> Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then<br> said:<br><br> ‘I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!’<br><br> ‘Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!’<br><br> ‘And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'‘<br><br> ‘Go on, Tom!’<br><br> ‘Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you believed<br> the door was open.’<br><br> ‘As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!’<br><br> ‘And then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if you<br> made Sid go and--and--’<br><br> ‘Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?’<br><br> ‘You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.’<br><br> ‘Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my<br> days! Don't tell me there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny<br> Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her<br> get around this with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!’<br><br> ‘Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn't<br> bad, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible<br> than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.’<br><br> ‘And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!’<br><br> ‘And then you began to cry.’<br><br> ‘So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--’<br><br> ‘Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and<br> she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it<br> out her own self--’<br><br> ‘Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you<br> was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!’<br><br> ‘Then Sid he said--he said--’<br><br> ‘I don't think I said anything,’ said Sid.<br><br> ‘Yes you did, Sid,’ said Mary.<br><br> ‘Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?’<br><br> ‘He said--I think he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone<br> to, but if I'd been better sometimes--’<br><br> ‘There, d'you hear that! It was his very words!’<br><br> ‘And you shut him up sharp.’<br><br> ‘I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There was an angel<br> there, somewheres!’<br><br> ‘And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you<br> told about Peter and the Pain-killer--’<br><br> ‘Just as true as I live!’<br><br> ‘And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us,<br> and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper<br> hugged and cried, and she went.’<br><br> ‘It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in<br> these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen<br> it! And then what? Go on, Tom!’<br><br> ‘Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every<br> word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and<br> wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being<br> pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked<br> so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and<br> kissed you on the lips.’<br><br> ‘Did you, Tom, did you! I just forgive you everything for that!’ And<br> she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the<br> guiltiest of villains.<br><br> ‘It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream,’ Sid soliloquized<br> just audibly.<br><br> ‘Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was<br> awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if you<br> was ever found again--now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the good<br> God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering and<br> merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness<br> knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings<br> and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's few enough<br> would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.<br> Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've hendered me long<br> enough.’<br><br> The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper<br> and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better<br> judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the<br> house. It was this: ‘Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any<br> mistakes in it!’<br><br> What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,<br> but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the<br> public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see<br> the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and<br> drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud<br> to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer<br> at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into<br> town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at<br> all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have<br> given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his<br> glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a<br> circus.<br><br> At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered<br> such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were<br> not long in becoming insufferably ‘stuck-up.’ They began to tell their<br> adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a<br> thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish<br> material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely<br> puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.<br><br> Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory<br> was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,<br> maybe she would be wanting to ‘make up.’ Well, let her--she should see<br> that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she<br> arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group<br> of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was<br> tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,<br> pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter<br> when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her<br> captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye<br> in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity<br> that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only ‘set him up’<br> the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he<br> knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved<br> irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and<br> wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more<br> particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang<br> and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her<br> feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to<br> a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:<br><br> ‘Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?’<br><br> ‘I did come--didn't you see me?’<br><br> ‘Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?’<br><br> ‘I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw you.’<br><br> ‘Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about<br> the picnic.’<br><br> ‘Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?’<br><br> ‘My ma's going to let me have one.’<br><br> ‘Oh, goody; I hope she'll let me come.’<br><br> ‘Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I<br> want, and I want you.’<br><br> ‘That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?’<br><br> ‘By and by. Maybe about vacation.’<br><br> ‘Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?’<br><br> ‘Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be’; and she glanced<br> ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence<br> about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the<br> great sycamore tree ‘all to flinders’ while he was ‘standing within<br> three feet of it.’<br><br> ‘Oh, may I come?’ said Grace Miller.<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘And me?’ said Sally Rogers.<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> ‘And me, too?’ said Susy Harper. ‘And Joe?’<br><br> ‘Yes.’<br><br> And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged<br> for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still<br> talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears<br> came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on<br> chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of<br> everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and<br> had what her sex call ‘a good cry.’ Then she sat moody, with wounded<br> pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast<br> in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what<br> she'd do.<br><br> At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant<br> self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate<br> her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden<br> falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind<br> the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so<br> absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,<br> that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.<br> Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for<br> throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He<br> called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He<br> wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,<br> for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He<br> did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly<br> he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced<br> as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and<br> again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could<br> not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that<br> Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the<br> living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her<br> fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.<br><br> Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had<br> to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in<br> vain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, ‘Oh, hang her, ain't I ever going<br> to get rid of her?’ At last he must be attending to those things--and she<br> said artlessly that she would be ‘around’ when school let out. And he<br> hastened away, hating her for it.<br><br> ‘Any other boy!’ Tom thought, grating his teeth. ‘Any boy in the whole<br> town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is<br> aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this<br> town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you<br> out! I'll just take and--’<br><br> And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy--pummelling<br> the air, and kicking and gouging. ‘Oh, you do, do you? You holler<br> 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!’ And so the imaginary<br> flogging was finished to his satisfaction.<br><br> Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's<br> grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other<br> distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the<br> minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to<br> cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,<br> and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at<br> a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew<br> entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When<br> poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept<br> exclaiming: ‘Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!’ she lost patience at<br> last, and said, ‘Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!’ and burst<br> into tears, and got up and walked away.<br><br> Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she<br> said:<br><br> ‘Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!’<br><br> So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said<br> she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,<br> crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was<br> humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl<br> had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.<br> He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.<br> He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much<br> risk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his<br> opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and<br> poured ink upon the page.<br><br> Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,<br> and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,<br> intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their<br> troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she<br> had changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she was<br> talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.<br> She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's<br> account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XIX<br><br> TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said<br> to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising<br> market:<br><br> ‘Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!’<br><br> ‘Auntie, what have I done?’<br><br> ‘Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old<br> softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about<br> that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was<br> over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't know<br> what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so<br> bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool<br> of myself and never say a word.’<br><br> This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had<br> seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked<br> mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to<br> say for a moment. Then he said:<br><br> ‘Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think.’<br><br> ‘Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your<br> own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from<br> Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could<br> think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think<br> to pity us and save us from sorrow.’<br><br> ‘Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't,<br> honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that<br> night.’<br><br> ‘What did you come for, then?’<br><br> ‘It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got<br> drownded.’<br><br> ‘Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could<br> believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never<br> did--and I know it, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times<br> worse.’<br><br> ‘It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from<br> grieving--that was all that made me come.’<br><br> ‘I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power<br> of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it<br> ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?’<br><br> ‘Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all<br> full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't<br> somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and<br> kept mum.’<br><br> ‘What bark?’<br><br> ‘The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,<br> you'd waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.’<br><br> The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned<br> in her eyes.<br><br> ‘Did you kiss me, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Why, yes, I did.’<br><br> ‘Are you sure you did, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.’<br><br> ‘What did you kiss me for, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.’<br><br> The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in<br> her voice when she said:<br><br> ‘Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't<br> bother me any more.’<br><br> The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a<br> jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her<br> hand, and said to herself:<br><br> ‘No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a<br> blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope<br> the Lord--I know the Lord will forgive him, because it was such<br> good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a<br> lie. I won't look.’<br><br> She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out<br> her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more<br> she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:<br> ‘It's a good lie--it's a good lie--I won't let it grieve me.’ So she<br> sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of<br> bark through flowing tears and saying: ‘I could forgive the boy, now, if<br> he'd committed a million sins!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XX<br><br> THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that<br> swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He<br> started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the<br> head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a<br> moment's hesitation he ran to her and said:<br><br> ‘I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever<br> do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won't you?’<br><br> The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:<br><br> ‘I'll thank you to keep yourself to yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll<br> never speak to you again.’<br><br> She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not<br> even presence of mind enough to say ‘Who cares, Miss Smarty?’ until the<br> right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a<br> fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were<br> a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently<br> encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled<br> one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in<br> her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to ‘take in,’<br> she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.<br> If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom's<br> offensive fling had driven it entirely away.<br><br> Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.<br> The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied<br> ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but<br> poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village<br> schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and<br> absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept<br> that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was<br> perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy<br> and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories<br> were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.<br> Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she<br> noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She<br> glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the<br> book in her hands. The titlepage--Professor Somebody's Anatomy--carried<br> no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at<br> once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece--a human figure,<br> stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer<br> stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky<br> snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the<br> pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,<br> turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.<br><br> ‘Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person<br> and look at what they're looking at.’<br><br> ‘How could I know you was looking at anything?’<br><br> ‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're<br> going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be<br> whipped, and I never was whipped in school.’<br><br> Then she stamped her little foot and said:<br><br> ‘Be so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen.<br> You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!’--and she flung<br> out of the house with a new explosion of crying.<br><br> Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said<br> to himself:<br><br> ‘What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in<br> school! Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl--they're so<br> thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell<br> old Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting<br> even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask<br> who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way<br> he always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the<br> right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell<br> on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a<br> kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way<br> out of it.’ Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: ‘All<br> right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it<br> out!’<br><br> Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the<br> master arrived and school ‘took in.’ Tom did not feel a strong interest<br> in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the<br> room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want<br> to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get<br> up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the<br> spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full<br> of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her<br> lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She<br> did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he<br> spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only<br> seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad<br> of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she<br> was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse<br> to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced<br> herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, ‘he'll tell about me<br> tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save his life!’<br><br> Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all<br> broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly<br> upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he<br> had denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck<br> to the denial from principle.<br><br> A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air<br> was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened<br> himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,<br> but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the<br> pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched<br> his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently<br> for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!<br> Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit<br> look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot<br> his quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,<br> too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.<br> Good!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring<br> through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little<br> instant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom<br> only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help<br> for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.<br> Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even<br> the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten--the<br> master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: ‘Who tore this book?’<br><br> There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness<br> continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.<br><br> ‘Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?’<br><br> A denial. Another pause.<br><br> ‘Joseph Harper, did you?’<br><br> Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the<br> slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of<br> boys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:<br><br> ‘Amy Lawrence?’<br><br> A shake of the head.<br><br> ‘Gracie Miller?’<br><br> The same sign.<br><br> ‘Susan Harper, did you do this?’<br><br> Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling<br> from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the<br> situation.<br><br> ‘Rebecca Thatcher’ [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with<br> terror]--’did you tear--no, look me in the face’ [her hands rose in<br> appeal]--’did you tear this book?’<br><br> A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his feet<br> and shouted--’I done it!’<br><br> The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a<br> moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward<br> to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that<br> shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred<br> floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without<br> an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever<br> administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a<br> command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he<br> knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not<br> count the tedious time as loss, either.<br><br> Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for<br> with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own<br> treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to<br> pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words<br> lingering dreamily in his ear--<br><br> ‘Tom, how could you be so noble!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXI<br><br> VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer<br> and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good<br> showing on ‘Examination’ day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle<br> now--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young<br> ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings<br> were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a<br> perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there<br> was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,<br> all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a<br> vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence<br> was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and<br> their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do<br> the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution<br> that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that<br> the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they<br> conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.<br> They swore in the signpainter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his<br> help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded<br> in his father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.<br> The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and<br> there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always<br> prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and<br> the signpainter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper<br> condition on Examination Evening he would ‘manage the thing’ while he<br> napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time<br> and hurried away to school.<br><br> In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in<br> the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with<br> wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in<br> his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.<br> He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and<br> six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town<br> and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of<br> citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the<br> scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of<br> small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;<br> rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in<br> lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their<br> grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and<br> the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with<br> non-participating scholars.<br><br> The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,<br> ‘You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,’<br> etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic<br> gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a<br> trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,<br> and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and<br> retired.<br><br> A little shamefaced girl lisped, ‘Mary had a little lamb,’ etc.,<br> performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and<br> sat down flushed and happy.<br><br> Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into<br> the unquenchable and indestructible ‘Give me liberty or give me death’<br> speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the<br> middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under<br> him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the<br> house but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than<br> its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom<br> struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak<br> attempt at applause, but it died early.<br><br> ‘The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck’ followed; also ‘The Assyrian Came<br> Down,’ and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,<br> and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The<br> prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original ‘compositions’<br> by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the<br> platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty<br> ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to ‘expression’<br> and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon<br> similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers,<br> and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the<br> Crusades. ‘Friendship’ was one; ‘Memories of Other Days’; ‘Religion in<br> History’; ‘Dream Land’; ‘The Advantages of Culture’; ‘Forms of Political<br> Government Compared and Contrasted’; ‘Melancholy’; ‘Filial Love’; ‘Heart<br> Longings,’ etc., etc.<br><br> A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted<br> melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of ‘fine language’;<br> another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words<br> and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that<br> conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable<br> sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one<br> of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was<br> made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious<br> mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of<br> these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the<br> fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will<br> be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in<br> all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their<br> compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the<br> most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always<br> the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely<br> truth is unpalatable.<br><br> Let us return to the ‘Examination.’ The first composition that was read<br> was one entitled ‘Is this, then, Life?’ Perhaps the reader can endure an<br> extract from it:<br><br> ‘In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the<br> youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!<br> Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the<br> voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, 'the<br> observed of all observers.' Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,<br> is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,<br> her step is lightest in the gay assembly.<br><br> ‘In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour<br> arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has<br> had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her<br> enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But<br> after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is<br> vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly<br> upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health<br> and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly<br> pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!’<br><br> And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to<br> time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of ‘How<br> sweet!’ ‘How eloquent!’ ‘So true!’ etc., and after the thing had closed<br> with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.<br><br> Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the ‘interesting’<br> paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a ‘poem.’ Two<br> stanzas of it will do:<br><br> ‘A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA<br><br> ‘Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well! But yet for a while do I leave thee<br> now! Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell, And burning<br> recollections throng my brow! For I have wandered through thy flowery<br> woods; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream; Have listened to<br> Tallassee's warring floods, And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.<br><br> ‘Yet shame I not to bear an o'erfull heart, Nor blush to turn behind<br> my tearful eyes; 'Tis from no stranger land I now must part, 'Tis to no<br> strangers left I yield these sighs. Welcome and home were mine within<br> this State, Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me And cold<br> must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete, When, dear Alabama! they turn<br> cold on thee!’ There were very few there who knew what ‘tete’ meant, but<br> the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.<br><br> Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,<br> who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began<br> to read in a measured, solemn tone:<br><br> ‘A VISION<br><br> ‘Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single<br> star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly<br> vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry<br> mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power<br> exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous<br> winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered<br> about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.<br><br> ‘At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit<br> sighed; but instead thereof,<br><br> ‘'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide--My joy in<br> grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my side. She moved like one of<br> those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy's Eden by<br> the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own<br> transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a<br> sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch,<br> as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away<br> unperceived--unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like<br> icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending<br> elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.’<br><br> This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a<br> sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took<br> the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest<br> effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize<br> to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by<br> far the most ‘eloquent’ thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel<br> Webster himself might well be proud of it.<br><br> It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which<br> the word ‘beauteous’ was over-fondled, and human experience referred to<br> as ‘life's page,’ was up to the usual average.<br><br> Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair<br> aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of<br> America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he<br> made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter<br> rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to<br> right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted<br> them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his<br> entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down<br> by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined<br> he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly<br> increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with<br> a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,<br> suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about<br> her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she<br> curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed<br> at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher--the cat was<br> within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head--down, down, a little<br> lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,<br> and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still<br> in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master's<br> bald pate--for the signpainter's boy had gilded it!<br><br> That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.<br><br> NOTE:--The pretended ‘compositions’ quoted in this chapter are taken<br> without alteration from a volume entitled ‘Prose and Poetry, by a<br> Western Lady’--but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl<br> pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXII<br><br> TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the<br> showy character of their ‘regalia.’ He promised to abstain from smoking,<br> chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out<br> a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way<br> in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon<br> found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire<br> grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display<br> himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth<br> of July was coming; but he soon gave that up--gave it up before he had<br> worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and fixed his hopes upon old<br> Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed<br> and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.<br> During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge's condition<br> and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high--so high that<br> he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the<br> looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.<br> At last he was pronounced upon the mend--and then convalescent. Tom was<br> disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation<br> at once--and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom<br> resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.<br><br> The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated<br> to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,<br> however--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but<br> found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he<br> could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.<br><br> Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning<br> to hang a little heavily on his hands.<br><br> He attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so he<br> abandoned it.<br><br> The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a<br> sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy<br> for two days.<br><br> Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained<br> hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man<br> in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States<br> Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not<br> twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.<br><br> A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents<br> made of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for girls--and<br> then circusing was abandoned.<br><br> A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the village<br> duller and drearier than ever.<br><br> There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so<br> delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.<br><br> Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her<br> parents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.<br><br> The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very<br> cancer for permanency and pain.<br><br> Then came the measles.<br><br> During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its<br> happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got<br> upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had<br> come over everything and every creature. There had been a ‘revival,’ and<br> everybody had ‘got religion,’ not only the adults, but even the boys and<br> girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed<br> sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe<br> Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing<br> spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a<br> basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to<br> the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy<br> he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in<br> desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn<br> and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he<br> crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,<br> forever and forever.<br><br> And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful<br> claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head<br> with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for<br> he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.<br> He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the<br> extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have<br> seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a<br> battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the<br> getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from<br> under an insect like himself.<br><br> By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its<br> object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His<br> second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.<br><br> The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he<br> spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad<br> at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how<br> lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted<br> listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a<br> juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her<br> victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a<br> stolen melon. Poor lads! they--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIII<br><br> AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder<br> trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village<br> talk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to<br> the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience<br> and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in<br> his hearing as ‘feelers’; he did not see how he could be suspected of<br> knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable<br> in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.<br> He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some<br> relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of<br> distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself<br> that Huck had remained discreet.<br><br> ‘Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?’<br><br> ‘'Bout what?’<br><br> ‘You know what.’<br><br> ‘Oh--'course I haven't.’<br><br> ‘Never a word?’<br><br> ‘Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?’<br><br> ‘Well, I was afeard.’<br><br> ‘Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.<br> You know that.’<br><br> Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:<br><br> ‘Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?’<br><br> ‘Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they<br> could get me to tell. They ain't no different way.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep<br> mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer.’<br><br> ‘I'm agreed.’<br><br> So they swore again with dread solemnities.<br><br> ‘What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it.’<br><br> ‘Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the<br> time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.’<br><br> ‘That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner.<br> Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?’<br><br> ‘Most always--most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever<br> done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to<br> get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do<br> that--leastways most of us--preachers and such like. But he's kind of<br> good--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two; and<br> lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.’<br><br> ‘Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.<br> I wish we could get him out of there.’<br><br> ‘My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good;<br> they'd ketch him again.’<br><br> ‘Yes--so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens<br> when he never done--that.’<br><br> ‘I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain<br> in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.’<br><br> ‘Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he<br> was to get free they'd lynch him.’<br><br> ‘And they'd do it, too.’<br><br> The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the<br> twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood<br> of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that<br> something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But<br> nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in<br> this luckless captive.<br><br> The boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating and<br> gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and<br> there were no guards.<br><br> His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences<br> before--it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and<br> treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:<br><br> ‘You've been mighty good to me, boys--better'n anybody else in this town.<br> And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I used<br> to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the good<br> fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've<br> all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck<br> don't--they don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well,<br> boys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that's the only<br> way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it's right.<br> Right, and best, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk<br> about that. I don't want to make you feel bad; you've befriended me.<br> But what I want to say, is, don't you ever get drunk--then you won't<br> ever get here. Stand a litter furder west--so--that's it; it's a prime<br> comfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck<br> of trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly<br> faces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me<br> touch 'em. That's it. Shake hands--yourn'll come through the bars, but<br> mine's too big. Little hands, and weak--but they've helped Muff Potter a<br> power, and they'd help him more if they could.’<br><br> Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.<br> The next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an<br> almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.<br> Huck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.<br> Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination<br> always brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers<br> sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing<br> news--the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor<br> Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect<br> that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was<br> not the slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be.<br><br> Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He<br> was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to<br> sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for<br> this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented<br> in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took<br> their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and<br> hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all<br> the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,<br> stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and<br> the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings<br> among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These<br> details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation<br> that was as impressive as it was fascinating.<br><br> Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing<br> in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was<br> discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further<br> questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:<br><br> ‘Take the witness.’<br><br> The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when<br> his own counsel said:<br><br> ‘I have no questions to ask him.’<br><br> The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.<br> Counsel for the prosecution said:<br><br> ‘Take the witness.’<br><br> ‘I have no questions to ask him,’ Potter's lawyer replied.<br><br> A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's<br> possession.<br><br> ‘Take the witness.’<br><br> Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience<br> began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his<br> client's life without an effort?<br><br> Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when<br> brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand<br> without being cross-questioned.<br><br> Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the<br> graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was<br> brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined<br> by Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house<br> expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.<br> Counsel for the prosecution now said:<br><br> ‘By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have<br> fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the<br> unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.’<br><br> A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and<br> rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned<br> in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women's compassion<br> testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:<br><br> ‘Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we<br> foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed<br> while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced<br> by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.’ [Then<br> to the clerk:] ‘Call Thomas Sawyer!’<br><br> A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting<br> Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as<br> he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,<br> for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.<br><br> ‘Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the<br> hour of midnight?’<br><br> Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The<br> audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few<br> moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed<br> to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:<br><br> ‘In the graveyard!’<br><br> ‘A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were--’<br><br> ‘In the graveyard.’<br><br> A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.<br><br> ‘Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?’<br><br> ‘Yes, sir.’<br><br> ‘Speak up--just a trifle louder. How near were you?’<br><br> ‘Near as I am to you.’<br><br> ‘Were you hidden, or not?’<br><br> ‘I was hid.’<br><br> ‘Where?’<br><br> ‘Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.’<br><br> Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.<br><br> ‘Any one with you?’<br><br> ‘Yes, sir. I went there with--’<br><br> ‘Wait--wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We<br> will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with<br> you.’<br><br> Tom hesitated and looked confused.<br><br> ‘Speak out, my boy--don't be diffident. The truth is always respectable.<br> What did you take there?’<br><br> ‘Only a--a--dead cat.’<br><br> There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.<br><br> ‘We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us<br> everything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don't skip anything,<br> and don't be afraid.’<br><br> Tom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his<br> words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased<br> but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and<br> bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,<br> rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent<br> emotion reached its climax when the boy said:<br><br> ‘--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun<br> Joe jumped with the knife and--’<br><br> Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his<br> way through all opposers, and was gone!<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIV<br><br> TOM was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of the<br> young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper<br> magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,<br> if he escaped hanging.<br><br> As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom<br> and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort<br> of conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find<br> fault with it.<br><br> Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights<br> were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always<br> with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy<br> to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of<br> wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer<br> the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid<br> that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding<br> Injun Joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.<br> The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of<br> that? Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the<br> lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had<br> been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's<br> confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.<br><br> Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly<br> he wished he had sealed up his tongue.<br><br> Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the<br> other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a<br> safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.<br><br> Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun<br> Joe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a<br> detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked<br> wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that<br> craft usually achieve. That is to say, he ‘found a clew.’ But you can't<br> hang a ‘clew’ for murder, and so after that detective had got through<br> and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.<br><br> The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened<br> weight of apprehension.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXV<br><br> THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has<br> a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire<br> suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,<br> but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.<br> Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would<br> answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him<br> confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand<br> in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,<br> for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is<br> not money. ‘Where'll we dig?’ said Huck.<br><br> ‘Oh, most anywhere.’<br><br> ‘Why, is it hid all around?’<br><br> ‘No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places,<br> Huck--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of<br> a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but<br> mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.’<br><br> ‘Who hides it?’<br><br> ‘Why, robbers, of course--who'd you reckon? Sunday-school<br> sup'rintendents?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have a<br> good time.’<br><br> ‘So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and<br> leave it there.’<br><br> ‘Don't they come after it any more?’<br><br> ‘No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else<br> they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and<br> by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks--a<br> paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly<br> signs and hy'roglyphics.’<br><br> ‘Hyro--which?’<br><br> ‘Hy'roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean<br> anything.’<br><br> ‘Have you got one of them papers, Tom?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Well then, how you going to find the marks?’<br><br> ‘I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on<br> an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out. Well,<br> we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again some<br> time; and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch, and<br> there's lots of dead-limb trees--dead loads of 'em.’<br><br> ‘Is it under all of them?’<br><br> ‘How you talk! No!’<br><br> ‘Then how you going to know which one to go for?’<br><br> ‘Go for all of 'em!’<br><br> ‘Why, Tom, it'll take all summer.’<br><br> ‘Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars<br> in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds. How's<br> that?’<br><br> Huck's eyes glowed.<br><br> ‘That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred<br> dollars and I don't want no di'monds.’<br><br> ‘All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some<br> of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain't any, hardly, but's<br> worth six bits or a dollar.’<br><br> ‘No! Is that so?’<br><br> ‘Cert'nly--anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?’<br><br> ‘Not as I remember.’<br><br> ‘Oh, kings have slathers of them.’<br><br> ‘Well, I don' know no kings, Tom.’<br><br> ‘I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of<br> 'em hopping around.’<br><br> ‘Do they hop?’<br><br> ‘Hop?--your granny! No!’<br><br> ‘Well, what did you say they did, for?’<br><br> ‘Shucks, I only meant you'd see 'em--not hopping, of course--what do<br> they want to hop for?--but I mean you'd just see 'em--scattered around,<br> you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.’<br><br> ‘Richard? What's his other name?’<br><br> ‘He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name.’<br><br> ‘No?’<br><br> ‘But they don't.’<br><br> ‘Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king<br> and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you going<br> to dig first?’<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the<br> hill t'other side of Still-House branch?’<br><br> ‘I'm agreed.’<br><br> So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their<br> three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves<br> down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.<br><br> ‘I like this,’ said Tom.<br><br> ‘So do I.’<br><br> ‘Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your<br> share?’<br><br> ‘Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go to every<br> circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time.’<br><br> ‘Well, ain't you going to save any of it?’<br><br> ‘Save it? What for?’<br><br> ‘Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.’<br><br> ‘Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day<br> and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd clean<br> it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?’<br><br> ‘I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure'nough sword, and a red necktie<br> and a bull pup, and get married.’<br><br> ‘Married!’<br><br> ‘That's it.’<br><br> ‘Tom, you--why, you ain't in your right mind.’<br><br> ‘Wait--you'll see.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my<br> mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty<br> well.’<br><br> ‘That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight.’<br><br> ‘Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you<br> better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name<br> of the gal?’<br><br> ‘It ain't a gal at all--it's a girl.’<br><br> ‘It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both's<br> right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?’<br><br> ‘I'll tell you some time--not now.’<br><br> ‘All right--that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer<br> than ever.’<br><br> ‘No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and<br> we'll go to digging.’<br><br> They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another<br> halfhour. Still no result. Huck said:<br><br> ‘Do they always bury it as deep as this?’<br><br> ‘Sometimes--not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the right<br> place.’<br><br> So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,<br> but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.<br> Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his<br> brow with his sleeve, and said:<br><br> ‘Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?’<br><br> ‘I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff<br> Hill back of the widow's.’<br><br> ‘I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from<br> us, Tom? It's on her land.’<br><br> ‘She take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one<br> of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference<br> whose land it's on.’<br><br> That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:<br><br> ‘Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?’<br><br> ‘It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches<br> interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now.’<br><br> ‘Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!<br> What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow<br> of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where you dig!’<br><br> ‘Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang<br> it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way. Can<br> you get out?’<br><br> ‘I bet I will. We've got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees<br> these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'll come around and maow tonight.’<br><br> ‘All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes.’<br><br> The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in<br> the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by<br> old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked<br> in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the<br> distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were<br> subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged<br> that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to<br> dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and<br> their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,<br> but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon<br> something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone<br> or a chunk. At last Tom said:<br><br> ‘It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again.’<br><br> ‘Well, but we can't be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.’<br><br> ‘I know it, but then there's another thing.’<br><br> ‘What's that?’.<br><br> ‘Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too<br> early.’<br><br> Huck dropped his shovel.<br><br> ‘That's it,’ said he. ‘That's the very trouble. We got to give this one<br> up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's<br> too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering<br> around so. I feel as if something's behind me all the time; and I'm<br> afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others in front a-waiting for<br> a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.’<br><br> ‘Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a<br> dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.’<br><br> ‘Lordy!’<br><br> ‘Yes, they do. I've always heard that.’<br><br> ‘Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A<br> body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure.’<br><br> ‘I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick<br> his skull out and say something!’<br><br> ‘Don't Tom! It's awful.’<br><br> ‘Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit.’<br><br> ‘Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else.’<br><br> ‘All right, I reckon we better.’<br><br> ‘What'll it be?’<br><br> Tom considered awhile; and then said:<br><br> ‘The ha'nted house. That's it!’<br><br> ‘Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight<br> worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come<br> sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your<br> shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I<br> couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could.’<br><br> ‘Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't<br> hender us from digging there in the daytime.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that<br> ha'nted house in the day nor the night.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been<br> murdered, anyway--but nothing's ever been seen around that house except<br> in the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular<br> ghosts.’<br><br> ‘Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,<br> you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.<br> Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em.’<br><br> ‘Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so<br> what's the use of our being afeard?’<br><br> ‘Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so--but I<br> reckon it's taking chances.’<br><br> They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the<br> moonlit valley below them stood the ‘ha'nted’ house, utterly isolated,<br> its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the<br> chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof<br> caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit<br> past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the<br> circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted<br> house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that<br> adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XVI<br><br> ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come<br> for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was<br> measurably so, also--but suddenly said:<br><br> ‘Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?’<br><br> Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his<br> eyes with a startled look in them--<br><br> ‘My! I never once thought of it, Huck!’<br><br> ‘Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was<br> Friday.’<br><br> ‘Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an<br> awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.’<br><br> ‘Might! Better say we would! There's some lucky days, maybe, but<br> Friday ain't.’<br><br> ‘Any fool knows that. I don't reckon you was the first that found it<br> out, Huck.’<br><br> ‘Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had a<br> rotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.’<br><br> ‘No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?’<br><br> ‘No.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that<br> there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty<br> sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for today, and play. Do<br> you know Robin Hood, Huck?’<br><br> ‘No. Who's Robin Hood?’<br><br> ‘Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the<br> best. He was a robber.’<br><br> ‘Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?’<br><br> ‘Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But<br> he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with 'em<br> perfectly square.’<br><br> ‘Well, he must 'a' been a brick.’<br><br> ‘I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.<br> They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in<br> England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow<br> and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.’<br><br> ‘What's a yew bow?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that<br> dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse. But we'll<br> play Robin Hood--it's nobby fun. I'll learn you.’<br><br> ‘I'm agreed.’<br><br> So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a<br> yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the<br> morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink<br> into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows<br> of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff<br> Hill.<br><br> On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.<br> They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their<br> last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were<br> so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down<br> within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and<br> turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this<br> time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling<br> that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the<br> requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.<br><br> When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and<br> grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,<br> and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the<br> place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they<br> crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,<br> floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,<br> a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and<br> abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened<br> pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,<br> and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.<br><br> In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the<br> place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own<br> boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.<br> This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring<br> each other, and of course there could be but one result--they threw their<br> tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of<br> decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the<br> promise was a fraud--there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now<br> and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when--<br><br> ‘Sh!’ said Tom.<br><br> ‘What is it?’ whispered Huck, blanching with fright.<br><br> ‘Sh!... There!... Hear it?’<br><br> ‘Yes!... Oh, my! Let's run!’<br><br> ‘Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door.’<br><br> The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to<br> knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.<br><br> ‘They've stopped.... No--coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper another<br> word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!’<br><br> Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: ‘There's the old deaf and<br> dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately--never saw<br> t'other man before.’<br><br> ‘T'other’ was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant<br> in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white<br> whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore<br> green goggles. When they came in, ‘t'other’ was talking in a low voice;<br> they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the<br> wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less<br> guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:<br><br> ‘No,’ said he, ‘I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's<br> dangerous.’<br><br> ‘Dangerous!’ grunted the ‘deaf and dumb’ Spaniard--to the vast surprise<br> of the boys. ‘Milksop!’<br><br> This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was<br> silence for some time. Then Joe said:<br><br> ‘What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing's come of<br> it.’<br><br> ‘That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.<br> 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed.’<br><br> ‘Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody<br> would suspicion us that saw us.’<br><br> ‘I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool<br> of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it<br> warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys<br> playing over there on the hill right in full view.’<br><br> ‘Those infernal boys’ quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,<br> and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and<br> concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a<br> year.<br><br> The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and<br> thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:<br><br> ‘Look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there<br> till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this town<br> just once more, for a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after I've<br> spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!<br> We'll leg it together!’<br><br> This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe<br> said:<br><br> ‘I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch.’<br><br> He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred<br> him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to<br> nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.<br><br> The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:<br><br> ‘Now's our chance--come!’<br><br> Huck said:<br><br> ‘I can't--I'd die if they was to wake.’<br><br> Tom urged--Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and<br> started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak<br> from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never<br> made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments<br> till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;<br> and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.<br><br> Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly upon<br> his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him up with<br> his foot and said:<br><br> ‘Here! You're a watchman, ain't you! All right, though--nothing's<br> happened.’<br><br> ‘My! have I been asleep?’<br><br> ‘Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we<br> do with what little swag we've got left?’<br><br> ‘I don't know--leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to<br> take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's<br> something to carry.’<br><br> ‘Well--all right--it won't matter to come here once more.’<br><br> ‘No--but I'd say come in the night as we used to do--it's better.’<br><br> ‘Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right<br> chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good<br> place; we'll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.’<br><br> ‘Good idea,’ said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,<br> raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled<br> pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself<br> and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on<br> his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.<br><br> The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With<br> gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!--the splendor of it was<br> beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make<br> half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest<br> auspices--there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to<br> dig. They nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and easily<br> understood, for they simply meant--’Oh, but ain't you glad now we're<br> here!’<br><br> Joe's knife struck upon something.<br><br> ‘Hello!’ said he.<br><br> ‘What is it?’ said his comrade.<br><br> ‘Half-rotten plank--no, it's a box, I believe. Here--bear a hand and we'll<br> see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole.’<br><br> He reached his hand in and drew it out--<br><br> ‘Man, it's money!’<br><br> The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys<br> above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.<br><br> Joe's comrade said:<br><br> ‘We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst<br> the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a<br> minute ago.’<br><br> He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the<br> pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to<br> himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was<br> not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the<br> slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in<br> blissful silence.<br><br> ‘Pard, there's thousands of dollars here,’ said Injun Joe.<br><br> ‘'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one<br> summer,’ the stranger observed.<br><br> ‘I know it,’ said Injun Joe; ‘and this looks like it, I should say.’<br><br> ‘Now you won't need to do that job.’<br><br> The halfbreed frowned. Said he:<br><br> ‘You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't<br> robbery altogether--it's revenge!’ and a wicked light flamed in his<br> eyes. ‘I'll need your help in it. When it's finished--then Texas. Go home<br> to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.’<br><br> ‘Well--if you say so; what'll we do with this--bury it again?’<br><br> ‘Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] No! by the great Sachem, no!<br> [Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh<br> earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business<br> has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on<br> them? Who brought them here--and where are they gone? Have you heard<br> anybody?--seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and<br> see the ground disturbed? Not exactly--not exactly. We'll take it to my<br> den.’<br><br> ‘Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number<br> One?’<br><br> ‘No--Number Two--under the cross. The other place is bad--too common.’<br><br> ‘All right. It's nearly dark enough to start.’<br><br> Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping<br> out. Presently he said:<br><br> ‘Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be<br> upstairs?’<br><br> The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,<br> halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The<br> boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came<br> creaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke<br> the stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the<br> closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on<br> the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself<br> up cursing, and his comrade said:<br><br> ‘Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up there,<br> let them stay there--who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get<br> into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes--and then<br> let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever<br> hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or<br> devils or something. I'll bet they're running yet.’<br><br> Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight<br> was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.<br> Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening<br> twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.<br><br> Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them<br> through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They<br> were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the<br> townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much<br> absorbed in hating themselves--hating the ill luck that made them take<br> the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have<br> suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait<br> there till his ‘revenge’ was satisfied, and then he would have had the<br> misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that<br> the tools were ever brought there!<br><br> They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to<br> town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to<br> ‘Number Two,’ wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to<br> Tom.<br><br> ‘Revenge? What if he means us, Huck!’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't!’ said Huck, nearly fainting.<br><br> They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe<br> that he might possibly mean somebody else--at least that he might at<br> least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.<br><br> Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company<br> would be a palpable improvement, he thought.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVII<br><br> THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that night.<br> Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times<br> it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and<br> wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay<br> in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he<br> noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away--somewhat as if<br> they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it<br> occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There<br> was one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the<br> quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen<br> as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of<br> his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to<br> ‘hundreds’ and ‘thousands’ were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that<br> no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for<br> a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in<br> actual money in any one's possession. If his notions of hidden treasure<br> had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of<br> real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.<br><br> But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer<br> under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found<br> himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a<br> dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a<br> hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale<br> of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking<br> very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If<br> he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a<br> dream.<br><br> ‘Hello, Huck!’<br><br> ‘Hello, yourself.’<br><br> Silence, for a minute.<br><br> ‘Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got<br> the money. Oh, ain't it awful!’<br><br> ‘'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.<br> Dog'd if I don't, Huck.’<br><br> ‘What ain't a dream?’<br><br> ‘Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.’<br><br> ‘Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream<br> it was! I've had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish<br> devil going for me all through 'em--rot him!’<br><br> ‘No, not rot him. Find him! Track the money!’<br><br> ‘Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for such<br> a pile--and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,<br> anyway.’<br><br> ‘Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to his<br> Number Two.’<br><br> ‘Number Two--yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't make<br> nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?’<br><br> ‘I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it's the number of a house!’<br><br> ‘Goody!... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse<br> town. They ain't no numbers here.’<br><br> ‘Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it's the number of a<br> room--in a tavern, you know!’<br><br> ‘Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out<br> quick.’<br><br> ‘You stay here, Huck, till I come.’<br><br> Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public<br> places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.<br> 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.<br> In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper's<br> young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody<br> go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any<br> particular reason for this state of things; had had some little<br> curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery<br> by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was ‘ha'nted’; had<br> noticed that there was a light in there the night before.<br><br> ‘That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're<br> after.’<br><br> ‘I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?’<br><br> ‘Lemme think.’<br><br> Tom thought a long time. Then he said:<br><br> ‘I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out<br> into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap<br> of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and<br> I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there and<br> try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he<br> was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get<br> his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to<br> that No. 2, that ain't the place.’<br><br> ‘Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!’<br><br> ‘Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you--and if he did,<br> maybe he'd never think anything.’<br><br> ‘Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono--I dono. I'll<br> try.’<br><br> ‘You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found<br> out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.’<br><br> ‘It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!’<br><br> ‘Now you're talking! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXVIII<br><br> THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about<br> the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley<br> at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or<br> left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern<br> door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the<br> understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck<br> was to come and ‘maow,’ whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.<br> But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to<br> bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.<br><br> Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday<br> night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's<br> old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the<br> lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before<br> midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)<br> were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the<br> alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,<br> the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of<br> distant thunder.<br><br> Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the<br> towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.<br> Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was<br> a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a<br> mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it<br> would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive<br> yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have<br> fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and<br> excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer<br> and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and<br> momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away<br> his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to<br> inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the<br> way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came<br> tearing by him: ‘Run!’ said he; ‘run, for your life!’<br><br> He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or<br> forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never<br> stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the<br> lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm<br> burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:<br><br> ‘Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;<br> but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly<br> get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either.<br> Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and<br> open comes the door! It warn't locked! I hopped in, and shook off the<br> towel, and, Great Caesar's Ghost!’<br><br> ‘What!--what'd you see, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!’<br><br> ‘No!’<br><br> ‘Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch<br> on his eye and his arms spread out.’<br><br> ‘Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?’<br><br> ‘No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and<br> started!’<br><br> ‘I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!’<br><br> ‘Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.’<br><br> ‘Say, Tom, did you see that box?’<br><br> ‘Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see<br> the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor<br> by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.<br> Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?’<br><br> ‘How?’<br><br> ‘Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe all the Temperance Taverns have<br> got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?’<br><br> ‘Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But<br> say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's<br> drunk.’<br><br> ‘It is, that! You try it!’<br><br> Huck shuddered.<br><br> ‘Well, no--I reckon not.’<br><br> ‘And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't<br> enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.’<br><br> There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:<br><br> ‘Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun<br> Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll<br> be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll<br> snatch that box quicker'n lightning.’<br><br> ‘Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every<br> night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.’<br><br> ‘All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a<br> block and maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window<br> and that'll fetch me.’<br><br> ‘Agreed, and good as wheat!’<br><br> ‘Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be<br> daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will<br> you?’<br><br> ‘I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for<br> a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.’<br><br> ‘That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?’<br><br> ‘In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man,<br> Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any<br> time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.<br> That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as<br> if I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat with him. But<br> you needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry<br> he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.’<br><br> ‘Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't<br> come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night,<br> just skip right around and maow.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXIX<br><br> THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of<br> news--Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before.<br> Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a<br> moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy's interest. He saw her<br> and they had an exhausting good time playing ‘hispy’ and ‘gully-keeper’<br> with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in<br> a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint<br> the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she<br> consented. The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more<br> moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway<br> the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation<br> and pleasurable anticipation. Tom's excitement enabled him to keep<br> awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's<br> ‘maow,’ and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers<br> with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.<br><br> Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and<br> rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was<br> ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the<br> picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough<br> under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young<br> gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was<br> chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main<br> street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss<br> the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.<br> Thatcher said to Becky, was:<br><br> ‘You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with<br> some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.’<br><br> ‘Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.’<br><br> ‘Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.’<br><br> Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:<br><br> ‘Say--I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll<br> climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll have<br> ice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she'll be<br> awful glad to have us.’<br><br> ‘Oh, that will be fun!’<br><br> Then Becky reflected a moment and said:<br><br> ‘But what will mamma say?’<br><br> ‘How'll she ever know?’<br><br> The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:<br><br> ‘I reckon it's wrong--but--’<br><br> ‘But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she<br> wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if<br> she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!’<br><br> The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and<br> Tom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say<br> nothing to anybody about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to<br> Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The<br> thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he<br> could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he<br> give it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so<br> why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the<br> evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined<br> to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of<br> the box of money another time that day.<br><br> Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody<br> hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest<br> distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and<br> laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone<br> through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified<br> with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things<br> began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in<br> the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:<br><br> ‘Who's ready for the cave?’<br><br> Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there<br> was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the<br> hillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood<br> unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled<br> by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was<br> romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out<br> upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the<br> situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment<br> a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a<br> struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked<br> down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a<br> new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went<br> filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of<br> lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of<br> junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than<br> eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower<br> crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal's cave was but a<br> vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again<br> and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights<br> together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never<br> find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and<br> still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under<br> labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man ‘knew’ the cave. That was<br> an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it<br> was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer<br> knew as much of the cave as any one.<br><br> The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of<br> a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch<br> avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise<br> at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude<br> each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the<br> ‘known’ ground.<br><br> By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth<br> of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow<br> drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of<br> the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking<br> no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had<br> been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's<br> adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat<br> with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for<br> the wasted time but the captain of the craft.<br><br> Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went<br> glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young<br> people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly<br> tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not<br> stop at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his<br> attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten<br> o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began<br> to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village<br> betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the<br> silence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were<br> put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long<br> time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?<br> Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?<br><br> A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley<br> door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next<br> moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under<br> his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.<br> Why call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men would get away with the box<br> and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow<br> them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So<br> communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the<br> men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough<br> ahead not to be invisible.<br><br> They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up<br> a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the<br> path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old<br> Welshman's house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still<br> climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.<br> But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.<br> They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and<br> were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his<br> distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along<br> awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved<br> on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that<br> he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an<br> owl came over the hill--ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was<br> everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man<br> cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck's heart shot into his<br> throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as<br> if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he<br> thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He<br> knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas'<br> grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard<br> to find.<br><br> Now there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe's:<br><br> ‘Damn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is.’<br><br> ‘I can't see any.’<br><br> This was that stranger's voice--the stranger of the haunted house. A<br> deadly chill went to Huck's heart--this, then, was the ‘revenge’ job! His<br> thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been<br> kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder<br> her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn't<br> dare--they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in<br> the moment that elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun Joe's<br> next--which was--<br><br> ‘Because the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don't you?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Well, there is company there, I reckon. Better give it up.’<br><br> ‘Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and<br> maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you<br> before, I don't care for her swag--you may have it. But her husband was<br> rough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the justice<br> of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't<br> a millionth part of it! He had me horsewhipped!--horsewhipped in<br> front of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on!<br> Horsewhipped!--do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But<br> I'll take it out of her.’<br><br> ‘Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!’<br><br> ‘Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill him if he was<br> here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't<br> kill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch her<br> ears like a sow!’<br><br> ‘By God, that's--’<br><br> ‘Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie her<br> to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry, if<br> she does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing--for my sake--that's<br> why you're here--I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill you.<br> Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill her--and<br> then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this business.’<br><br> ‘Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the<br> better--I'm all in a shiver.’<br><br> ‘Do it now? And company there? Look here--I'll get suspicious of you,<br> first thing you know. No--we'll wait till the lights are out--there's no<br> hurry.’<br><br> Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful<br> than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped<br> gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,<br> one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one<br> side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same<br> elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig<br> snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no<br> sound--the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he<br> turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned<br> himself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but<br> cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and<br> so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he<br> reached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads<br> of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.<br><br> ‘What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?’<br><br> ‘Let me in--quick! I'll tell everything.’<br><br> ‘Why, who are you?’<br><br> ‘Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!’<br><br> ‘Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge!<br> But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble.’<br><br> ‘Please don't ever tell I told you,’ were Huck's first words when he got<br> in. ‘Please don't--I'd be killed, sure--but the widow's been good friends<br> to me sometimes, and I want to tell--I will tell if you'll promise you<br> won't ever say it was me.’<br><br> ‘By George, he has got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!’<br> exclaimed the old man; ‘out with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad.’<br><br> Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the<br> hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in<br> their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great<br> bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and<br> then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.<br><br> Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as<br> fast as his legs could carry him.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXX<br><br> AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came<br> groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The<br> inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,<br> on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a<br> window:<br><br> ‘Who's there!’<br><br> Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:<br><br> ‘Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!’<br><br> ‘It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!’<br><br> These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest<br> he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever<br> been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he<br> entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall<br> sons speedily dressed themselves.<br><br> ‘Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be<br> ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too--make<br> yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop<br> here last night.’<br><br> ‘I was awful scared,’ said Huck, ‘and I run. I took out when the pistols<br> went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted<br> to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't<br> want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.’<br><br> ‘Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it--but<br> there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they<br> ain't dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right<br> where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along<br> on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar that<br> sumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the<br> meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use--'twas bound to<br> come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when<br> the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,<br> I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the rustling<br> was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and<br> we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.<br> They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by<br> and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet<br> we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a<br> posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it<br> is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys<br> will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of<br> those rascals--'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see what they<br> were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?’<br><br> ‘Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.’<br><br> ‘Splendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!’<br><br> ‘One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or<br> twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged--’<br><br> ‘That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back<br> of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and<br> tell the sheriff--get your breakfast tomorrow morning!’<br><br> The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck<br> sprang up and exclaimed:<br><br> ‘Oh, please don't tell anybody it was me that blowed on them! Oh,<br> please!’<br><br> ‘All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what<br> you did.’<br><br> ‘Oh no, no! Please don't tell!’<br><br> When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:<br><br> ‘They won't tell--and I won't. But why don't you want it known?’<br><br> Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too<br> much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew<br> anything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for knowing<br> it, sure.<br><br> The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:<br><br> ‘How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking<br> suspicious?’<br><br> Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:<br><br> ‘Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so, and<br> I don't see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account<br> of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of<br> doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I<br> come along upstreet 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I<br> got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed<br> up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes<br> these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their<br> arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one<br> wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up<br> their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,<br> by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a<br> rusty, ragged-looking devil.’<br><br> ‘Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?’<br><br> This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know--but somehow it seems as if I did.’<br><br> ‘Then they went on, and you--’<br><br> ‘Follered 'em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they sneaked<br> along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and<br> heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd<br> spile her looks just as I told you and your two--’<br><br> ‘What! The deaf and dumb man said all that!’<br><br> Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep<br> the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,<br> and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of<br> all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,<br> but the old man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.<br> Presently the Welshman said:<br><br> ‘My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for<br> all the world. No--I'd protect you--I'd protect you. This Spaniard is<br> not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't<br> cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want<br> to keep dark. Now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me--I won't<br> betray you.’<br><br> Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and<br> whispered in his ear:<br><br> ‘'Tain't a Spaniard--it's Injun Joe!’<br><br> The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:<br><br> ‘It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and<br> slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because<br> white men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a<br> different matter altogether.’<br><br> During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man<br> said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going<br> to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for<br> marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--<br><br> ‘Of what?’<br><br> If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more<br> stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring<br> wide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer. The Welshman<br> started--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten--then replied:<br><br> ‘Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the matter with you?’<br><br> Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The<br> Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:<br><br> ‘Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what<br> did give you that turn? What were you expecting we'd found?’<br><br> Huck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would have<br> given anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing suggested<br> itself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a senseless<br> reply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered<br> it--feebly:<br><br> ‘Sunday-school books, maybe.’<br><br> Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and<br> joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and<br> ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because<br> it cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:<br><br> ‘Poor old chap, you're white and jaded--you ain't well a bit--no wonder<br> you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it.<br> Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.’<br><br> Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such<br> a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel<br> brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the<br> talk at the widow's stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,<br> however--he had not known that it wasn't--and so the suggestion of a<br> captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole<br> he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all<br> question that that bundle was not the bundle, and so his mind was<br> at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be<br> drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still<br> in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and<br> Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of<br> interruption.<br><br> Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck<br> jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even<br> remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and<br> gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of<br> citizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile. So the news<br> had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the<br> visitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.<br><br> ‘Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more<br> beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me<br> to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him.’<br><br> Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the<br> main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his<br> visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he<br> refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the<br> widow said:<br><br> ‘I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that<br> noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?’<br><br> ‘We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come<br> again--they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of<br> waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard<br> at your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back.’<br><br> More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple<br> of hours more.<br><br> There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody<br> was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came<br> that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the<br> sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs.<br> Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:<br><br> ‘Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired<br> to death.’<br><br> ‘Your Becky?’<br><br> ‘Yes,’ with a startled look--’didn't she stay with you last night?’<br><br> ‘Why, no.’<br><br> Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,<br> talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:<br><br> ‘Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy<br> that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last<br> night--one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to<br> settle with him.’<br><br> Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.<br><br> ‘He didn't stay with us,’ said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A<br> marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.<br><br> ‘Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?’<br><br> ‘No'm.’<br><br> ‘When did you see him last?’<br><br> Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had<br> stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding<br> uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously<br> questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed<br> whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;<br> it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One<br> young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!<br> Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her<br> hands.<br><br> The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to<br> street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and<br> the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant<br> insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs<br> were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half<br> an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward<br> the cave.<br><br> All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women<br> visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They<br> cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the<br> tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at<br> last, all the word that came was, ‘Send more candles--and send food.’<br> Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher<br> sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed<br> no real cheer.<br><br> The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with<br> candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck<br> still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with<br> fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came<br> and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,<br> because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord's,<br> and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The<br> Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:<br><br> ‘You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off.<br> He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his<br> hands.’<br><br> Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the<br> village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the<br> news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being<br> ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and<br> crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered<br> through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither<br> and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their<br> hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,<br> far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names ‘BECKY &<br> TOM’ had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and<br> near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the<br> ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever<br> have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so<br> precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the<br> awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away<br> speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst<br> forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a<br> sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;<br> it was only a searcher's light.<br><br> Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and<br> the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.<br> The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the<br> Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the<br> public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck<br> feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly<br> dreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance<br> Tavern since he had been ill.<br><br> ‘Yes,’ said the widow.<br><br> Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:<br><br> ‘What? What was it?’<br><br> ‘Liquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn you<br> did give me!’<br><br> ‘Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer<br> that found it?’<br><br> The widow burst into tears. ‘Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you<br> before, you must not talk. You are very, very sick!’<br><br> Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great<br> powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever--gone<br> forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should<br> cry.<br><br> These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the<br> weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:<br><br> ‘There--he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody<br> could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope<br> enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXI<br><br> NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along<br> the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar<br> wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,<br> such as ‘The Drawing-Room,’ ‘The Cathedral,’ ‘Aladdin's Palace,’ and<br> so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky<br> engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle<br> wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their<br> candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,<br> postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been<br> frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they<br> scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls<br> were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging<br> shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream<br> of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with<br> it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara<br> in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind<br> it in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification. He found that<br> it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between<br> narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.<br><br> Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future<br> guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,<br> far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and<br> branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In<br> one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a<br> multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of<br> a man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and<br> presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into<br> it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was<br> incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst<br> of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which<br> had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites<br> together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the<br> roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a<br> bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by<br> hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their<br> ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky's hand and<br> hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for<br> a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out<br> of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the<br> fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got<br> rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,<br> which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the<br> shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would<br> be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the<br> deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the<br> children. Becky said:<br><br> ‘Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of<br> the others.’<br><br> ‘Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don't know how<br> far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear<br> them here.’<br><br> Becky grew apprehensive.<br><br> ‘I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back.’<br><br> ‘Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better.’<br><br> ‘Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.’<br><br> ‘I reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles<br> out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go<br> through there.’<br><br> ‘Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!’ and the girl<br> shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.<br><br> They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long<br> way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar<br> about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an<br> examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he<br> would say cheerily:<br><br> ‘Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right<br> away!’<br><br> But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began<br> to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of<br> finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was ‘all right,’ but<br> there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their<br> ring and sounded just as if he had said, ‘All is lost!’ Becky clung to<br> his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,<br> but they would come. At last she said:<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get<br> worse and worse off all the time.’<br><br> ‘Listen!’ said he.<br><br> Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were<br> conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down<br> the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that<br> resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.<br><br> ‘Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,’ said Becky.<br><br> ‘It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,’ and<br> he shouted again.<br><br> The ‘might’ was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so<br> confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but<br> there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried<br> his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his<br> manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he could not find his way<br> back!<br><br> ‘Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!’<br><br> ‘Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to<br> come back! No--I can't find the way. It's all mixed up.’<br><br> ‘Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful<br> place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!’<br><br> She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom<br> was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He<br> sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in<br> his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing<br> regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom<br> begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell<br> to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable<br> situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope<br> again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he<br> would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,<br> she said.<br><br> So they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do<br> was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of<br> reviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its<br> nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and<br> familiarity with failure.<br><br> By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so<br> much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.<br> She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his<br> pockets--yet he must economize.<br><br> By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay<br> attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was<br> grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,<br> was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to<br> invite death and shorten its pursuit.<br><br> At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.<br> Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,<br> and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom<br> tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements<br> were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore<br> so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.<br> He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural<br> under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and<br> rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing<br> into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and<br> dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a<br> breezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan<br> followed it.<br><br> ‘Oh, how could I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I<br> don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again.’<br><br> ‘I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find<br> the way out.’<br><br> ‘We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I<br> reckon we are going there.’<br><br> ‘Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying.’<br><br> They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried<br> to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was<br> that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not<br> be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this--they<br> could not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for<br> dripping water--they must find a spring. They found one presently, and<br> Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky<br> said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to<br> hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom<br> fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought<br> was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the<br> silence:<br><br> ‘Tom, I am so hungry!’<br><br> Tom took something out of his pocket.<br><br> ‘Do you remember this?’ said he.<br><br> Becky almost smiled.<br><br> ‘It's our wedding-cake, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got.’<br><br> ‘I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup<br> people do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--’<br><br> She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky<br> ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was<br> abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky<br> suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he<br> said:<br><br> ‘Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?’<br><br> Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.<br><br> ‘Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink.<br> That little piece is our last candle!’<br><br> Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort<br> her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:<br><br> ‘Tom!’<br><br> ‘Well, Becky?’<br><br> ‘They'll miss us and hunt for us!’<br><br> ‘Yes, they will! Certainly they will!’<br><br> ‘Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.’<br><br> ‘When would they miss us, Tom?’<br><br> ‘When they get back to the boat, I reckon.’<br><br> ‘Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn't come?’<br><br> ‘I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they<br> got home.’<br><br> A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw<br> that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!<br> The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of<br> grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers<br> also--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher<br> discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.<br><br> The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it<br> melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone<br> at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of<br> smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of utter darkness<br> reigned!<br><br> How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that<br> she was crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew<br> was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of<br> a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said<br> it might be Sunday, now--maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but<br> her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that<br> they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going<br> on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in<br> the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no<br> more.<br><br> The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A<br> portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But<br> they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted<br> desire.<br><br> By-and-by Tom said:<br><br> ‘SH! Did you hear that?’<br><br> Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the<br> faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by<br> the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently<br> he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little<br> nearer.<br><br> ‘It's them!’ said Tom; ‘they're coming! Come along, Becky--we're all<br> right now!’<br><br> The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,<br> however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded<br> against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three<br> feet deep, it might be a hundred--there was no passing it at any rate.<br> Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No<br> bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They<br> listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!<br> a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking<br> misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He<br> talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no<br> sounds came again.<br><br> The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged<br> on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed<br> it must be Tuesday by this time.<br><br> Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It<br> would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the<br> heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to<br> a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the<br> line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended<br> in a ‘jumping-off place.’ Tom got down on his knees and felt below,<br> and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands<br> conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the<br> right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding<br> a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,<br> and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun<br> Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the<br> next moment, to see the ‘Spaniard’ take to his heels and get himself out<br> of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come<br> over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have<br> disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom's<br> fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he<br> had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and<br> nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He<br> was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he<br> had only shouted ‘for luck.’<br><br> But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.<br> Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought<br> changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed<br> that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,<br> and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another<br> passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But<br> Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be<br> roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die--it would<br> not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he<br> chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak<br> to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would<br> stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.<br><br> Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show<br> of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;<br> then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the<br> passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with<br> bodings of coming doom.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXII<br><br> TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.<br> Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public<br> prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer<br> that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came<br> from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest<br> and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the<br> children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great<br> part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her<br> call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,<br> then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into<br> a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The<br> village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.<br><br> Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village<br> bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad<br> people, who shouted, ‘Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!’<br> Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself<br> and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage<br> drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward<br> march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after<br> huzzah!<br><br> The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the<br> greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour<br> a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized<br> the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to<br> speak but couldn't--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.<br><br> Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It<br> would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the<br> great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon<br> a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the<br> wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it<br> withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went<br> on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his<br> kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch<br> of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off<br> speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,<br> pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad<br> Mississippi rolling by!<br><br> And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that<br> speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He<br> told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told<br> him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was<br> going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and<br> convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to<br> where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way<br> out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried<br> for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them<br> and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men<br> didn't believe the wild tale at first, ‘because,’ said they, ‘you are<br> five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in’--then took<br> them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two<br> or three hours after dark and then brought them home.<br><br> Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him<br> were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind<br> them, and informed of the great news.<br><br> Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to<br> be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were<br> bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and<br> more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,<br> was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky<br> did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had<br> passed through a wasting illness.<br><br> Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could<br> not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.<br> He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his<br> adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by<br> to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;<br> also that the ‘ragged man's’ body had eventually been found in the river<br> near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,<br> perhaps.<br><br> About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to<br> visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting<br> talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge<br> Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The<br> Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him<br> ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom said he<br> thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:<br><br> ‘Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt.<br> But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any<br> more.’<br><br> ‘Why?’<br><br> ‘Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and<br> triple-locked--and I've got the keys.’<br><br> Tom turned as white as a sheet.<br><br> ‘What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!’<br><br> The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.<br><br> ‘Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!’<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIII<br><br> WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of<br> men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled<br> with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore<br> Judge Thatcher.<br><br> When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in<br> the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,<br> dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing<br> eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer<br> of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own<br> experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but<br> nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,<br> which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated<br> before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day<br> he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.<br><br> Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great<br> foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with<br> tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a<br> sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought<br> no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there<br> had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless<br> still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have<br> squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked<br> that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass the weary<br> time--in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could<br> find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this<br> vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner<br> had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a<br> few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The<br> poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a<br> stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded<br> by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off<br> the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had<br> scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once<br> in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick--a<br> dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling<br> when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome<br> were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the<br> British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was<br> ‘news.’<br><br> It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall<br> have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,<br> and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a<br> purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand<br> years to be ready for this flitting human insect's need? and has it<br> another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No<br> matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped<br> out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist<br> stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when<br> he comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands<br> first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even ‘Aladdin's Palace’<br> cannot rival it.<br><br> Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked<br> there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and<br> hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and<br> all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as<br> satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the<br> hanging.<br><br> This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to the<br> governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed;<br> many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of<br> sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the<br> governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty<br> under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the<br> village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would<br> have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a<br> pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired<br> and leaky water-works.<br><br> The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have<br> an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the<br> Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned<br> there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted<br> to talk about now. Huck's face saddened. He said:<br><br> ‘I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but<br> whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben<br> you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you<br> hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and<br> told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always<br> told me we'd never get holt of that swag.’<br><br> ‘Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. You know his tavern<br> was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you<br> was to watch there that night?’<br><br> ‘Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I<br> follered Injun Joe to the widder's.’<br><br> ‘You followed him?’<br><br> ‘Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and<br> I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't<br> ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.’<br><br> Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only<br> heard of the Welshman's part of it before.<br><br> ‘Well,’ said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, ‘whoever<br> nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways<br> it's a goner for us, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!’<br><br> ‘What!’ Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. ‘Tom, have you got on<br> the track of that money again?’<br><br> ‘Huck, it's in the cave!’<br><br> Huck's eyes blazed.<br><br> ‘Say it again, Tom.’<br><br> ‘The money's in the cave!’<br><br> ‘Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?’<br><br> ‘Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in<br> there with me and help get it out?’<br><br> ‘I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not<br> get lost.’<br><br> ‘Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the<br> world.’<br><br> ‘Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's--’<br><br> ‘Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll<br> agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will,<br> by jings.’<br><br> ‘All right--it's a whiz. When do you say?’<br><br> ‘Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?’<br><br> ‘Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,<br> now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.’<br><br> ‘It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,<br> but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know<br> about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff<br> down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You needn't ever<br> turn your hand over.’<br><br> ‘Less start right off, Tom.’<br><br> ‘All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little<br> bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled<br> things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I<br> had some when I was in there before.’<br><br> A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who<br> was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles<br> below ‘Cave Hollow,’ Tom said:<br><br> ‘Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the<br> cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see<br> that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's<br> one of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.’<br><br> They landed.<br><br> ‘Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out<br> of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.’<br><br> Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly<br> marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:<br><br> ‘Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country.<br> You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a robber,<br> but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run across<br> it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll<br> let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course there's got to be a<br> Gang, or else there wouldn't be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang--it<br> sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?’<br><br> ‘Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?’<br><br> ‘Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that's mostly the way.’<br><br> ‘And kill them?’<br><br> ‘No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.’<br><br> ‘What's a ransom?’<br><br> ‘Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after<br> you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's<br> the general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the women,<br> but you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully<br> scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat<br> off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers--you'll see<br> that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've<br> been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that<br> you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right<br> around and come back. It's so in all the books.’<br><br> ‘Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.’<br><br> ‘Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses<br> and all that.’<br><br> By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in<br> the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then<br> made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought<br> them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.<br> He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay<br> against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame<br> struggle and expire.<br><br> The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and<br> gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently<br> entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the<br> ‘jumping-off place.’ The candles revealed the fact that it was not<br> really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet<br> high. Tom whispered:<br><br> ‘Now I'll show you something, Huck.’<br><br> He held his candle aloft and said:<br><br> ‘Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on the<br> big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.’<br><br> ‘Tom, it's a cross!’<br><br> ‘Now where's your Number Two? 'under the cross,' hey? Right yonder's<br> where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!’<br><br> Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:<br><br> ‘Tom, less git out of here!’<br><br> ‘What! and leave the treasure?’<br><br> ‘Yes--leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.’<br><br> ‘No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he<br> died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.’<br><br> ‘No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of<br> ghosts, and so do you.’<br><br> Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in his mind.<br> But presently an idea occurred to him--<br><br> ‘Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's<br> ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!’<br><br> The point was well taken. It had its effect.<br><br> ‘Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that<br> cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.’<br><br> Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.<br> Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the<br> great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.<br> They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with<br> a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some<br> bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there<br> was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in<br> vain. Tom said:<br><br> ‘He said under the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the<br> cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the<br> ground.’<br><br> They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck<br> could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:<br><br> ‘Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay<br> about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's<br> that for? I bet you the money is under the rock. I'm going to dig in<br> the clay.’<br><br> ‘That ain't no bad notion, Tom!’ said Huck with animation.<br><br> Tom's ‘real Barlow’ was out at once, and he had not dug four inches<br> before he struck wood.<br><br> ‘Hey, Huck!--you hear that?’<br><br> Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and<br> removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.<br> Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he<br> could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed<br> to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended<br> gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to<br> the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and<br> exclaimed:<br><br> ‘My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!’<br><br> It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,<br> along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two<br> or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish<br> well soaked with the water-drip.<br><br> ‘Got it at last!’ said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with<br> his hand. ‘My, but we're rich, Tom!’<br><br> ‘Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but<br> we have got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it<br> out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.’<br><br> It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward<br> fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.<br><br> ‘I thought so,’ he said; ‘They carried it like it was heavy, that day<br> at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of<br> fetching the little bags along.’<br><br> The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross<br> rock.<br><br> ‘Now less fetch the guns and things,’ said Huck.<br><br> ‘No, Huck--leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we<br> go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our<br> orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.’<br><br> ‘What orgies?’<br><br> ‘I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to<br> have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's<br> getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get<br> to the skiff.’<br><br> They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily<br> out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the<br> skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got<br> under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting<br> cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.<br><br> ‘Now, Huck,’ said Tom, ‘we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's<br> woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide,<br> and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be<br> safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook<br> Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be gone a minute.’<br><br> He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small<br> sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,<br> dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman's<br> house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the<br> Welshman stepped out and said:<br><br> ‘Hallo, who's that?’<br><br> ‘Huck and Tom Sawyer.’<br><br> ‘Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.<br> Here--hurry up, trot ahead--I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as<br> light as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?’<br><br> ‘Old metal,’ said Tom.<br><br> ‘I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away<br> more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry<br> than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's<br> human nature--hurry along, hurry along!’<br><br> The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.<br><br> ‘Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.’<br><br> Huck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely<br> accused:<br><br> ‘Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.’<br><br> The Welshman laughed.<br><br> ‘Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you<br> and the widow good friends?’<br><br> ‘Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.’<br><br> ‘All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?’<br><br> This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he<br> found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room.<br> Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.<br><br> The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence<br> in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the<br> Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great<br> many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys<br> as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They<br> were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson<br> with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered<br> half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:<br><br> ‘Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and<br> Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.’<br><br> ‘And you did just right,’ said the widow. ‘Come with me, boys.’<br><br> She took them to a bedchamber and said:<br><br> ‘Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of<br> clothes--shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's--no, no<br> thanks, Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both<br> of you. Get into them. We'll wait--come down when you are slicked up<br> enough.’<br><br> Then she left.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIV<br><br> HUCK said: ‘Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't<br> high from the ground.’<br><br> ‘Shucks! what do you want to slope for?’<br><br> ‘Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't<br> going down there, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care of<br> you.’<br><br> Sid appeared.<br><br> ‘Tom,’ said he, ‘auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary<br> got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about you.<br> Say--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?’<br><br> ‘Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this<br> blowout about, anyway?’<br><br> ‘It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time<br> it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they<br> helped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something, if<br> you want to know.’<br><br> ‘Well, what?’<br><br> ‘Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people<br> here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a<br> secret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows--the<br> widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was bound<br> Huck should be here--couldn't get along with his grand secret without<br> Huck, you know!’<br><br> ‘Secret about what, Sid?’<br><br> ‘About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was<br> going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop<br> pretty flat.’<br><br> Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.<br><br> ‘Sid, was it you that told?’<br><br> ‘Oh, never mind who it was. Somebody told--that's enough.’<br><br> ‘Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and<br> that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the<br> hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean<br> things, and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.<br> There--no thanks, as the widow says’--and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped<br> him to the door with several kicks. ‘Now go and tell auntie if you<br> dare--and tomorrow you'll catch it!’<br><br> Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a<br> dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,<br> after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.<br> Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the<br> honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was<br> another person whose modesty--<br><br> And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in<br> the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the<br> surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and<br> effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,<br> the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many<br> compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot<br> the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely<br> intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze<br> and everybody's laudations.<br><br> The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him<br> educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in<br> business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:<br><br> ‘Huck don't need it. Huck's rich.’<br><br> Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept<br> back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But<br> the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:<br><br> ‘Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it.<br> Oh, you needn't smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.’<br><br> Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed<br> interest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.<br><br> ‘Sid, what ails Tom?’ said Aunt Polly. ‘He--well, there ain't ever any<br> making of that boy out. I never--’<br><br> Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly<br> did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the<br> table and said:<br><br> ‘There--what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!’<br><br> The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for<br> a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said<br> he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of<br> interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the<br> charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:<br><br> ‘I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it<br> don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm<br> willing to allow.’<br><br> The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand<br> dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time<br> before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably<br> more than that in property.<br><br> <br><br> <br> CHAPTER XXXV<br><br> THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a<br> mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a<br> sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked<br> about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens<br> tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every ‘haunted’<br> house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,<br> plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden<br> treasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic men, too,<br> some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,<br> stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had<br> possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and<br> repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as<br> remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying<br> commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and<br> discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper<br> published biographical sketches of the boys.<br><br> The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge<br> Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had<br> an income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in<br> the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got--no,<br> it was what he was promised--he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar<br> and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old<br> simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.<br><br> Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no<br> commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When<br> Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her<br> whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded<br> grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that<br> whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine<br> outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that<br> was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to<br> breast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky<br> thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he<br> walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight<br> off and told Tom about it.<br><br> Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some<br> day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the<br> National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school<br> in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or<br> both.<br><br> Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas'<br> protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled<br> him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The<br> widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they<br> bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot<br> or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had<br> to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;<br> he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so<br> properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he<br> turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him<br> hand and foot.<br><br> He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up<br> missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in<br> great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high<br> and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning<br> Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind<br> the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.<br> Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and<br> ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was<br> unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made<br> him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him<br> out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.<br> Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He<br> said:<br><br> ‘Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't<br> work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me,<br> and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just<br> at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all<br> to thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them<br> blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air<br> git through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't<br> set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a<br> cellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church<br> and sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in<br> there, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by<br> a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's so<br> awful reg'lar a body can't stand it.’<br><br> ‘Well, everybody does that way, Huck.’<br><br> ‘Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't<br> stand it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don't<br> take no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;<br> I got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do<br> everything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort--I'd got<br> to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste<br> in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke;<br> she wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor<br> scratch, before folks--’ [Then with a spasm of special irritation and<br> injury]--’And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a<br> woman! I had to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school's<br> going to open, and I'd a had to go to it--well, I wouldn't stand that,<br> Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's<br> just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead<br> all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, and<br> I ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into<br> all this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take<br> my sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not<br> many times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable<br> hard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.’<br><br> ‘Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if you'll<br> try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.’<br><br> ‘Like it! Yes--the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long<br> enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed<br> smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and<br> I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a cave,<br> and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up<br> and spile it all!’<br><br> Tom saw his opportunity--<br><br> ‘Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning<br> robber.’<br><br> ‘No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you<br> into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.’<br><br> Huck's joy was quenched.<br><br> ‘Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?’<br><br> ‘Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a<br> pirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up in<br> the nobility--dukes and such.’<br><br> ‘Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me<br> out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, would you, Tom?’<br><br> ‘Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I don't want to--but what would people<br> say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in<br> it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.’<br><br> Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he<br> said:<br><br> ‘Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I<br> can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.’<br><br> ‘All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the<br> widow to let up on you a little, Huck.’<br><br> ‘Will you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of<br> the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd<br> through or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?’<br><br> ‘Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation<br> tonight, maybe.’<br><br> ‘Have the which?’<br><br> ‘Have the initiation.’<br><br> ‘What's that?’<br><br> ‘It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's<br> secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and<br> all his family that hurts one of the gang.’<br><br> ‘That's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.’<br><br> ‘Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight,<br> in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted house is the<br> best, but they're all ripped up now.’<br><br> ‘Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.’<br><br> ‘Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with<br> blood.’<br><br> ‘Now, that's something like! Why, it's a million times bullier than<br> pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be<br> a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon<br> she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.’<br><br> CONCLUSION<br><br> SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a boy, it<br> must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the<br> history of a man. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows<br> exactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of<br> juveniles, he must stop where he best can.<br><br> Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are<br> prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the<br> story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they<br> turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that<br> part of their lives at present."}
