A Street.<br><br>[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]<br><br>Mercutio.<br> Where the devil should this Romeo be?—<br> Came he not home to-night?<br> Benvolio.<br> Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.<br> Mercutio.<br> Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,<br> Torments him so that he will sure run mad.<br> Benvolio.<br> Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,<br> Hath sent a letter to his father's house.<br> Mercutio.<br> A challenge, on my life.<br> Benvolio.<br> Romeo will answer it.<br> Mercutio.<br> Any man that can write may answer a letter.<br> Benvolio. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.<br><br>Mercutio. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?<br><br>Benvolio.<br> Why, what is Tybalt?<br> Mercutio. More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he's the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song—keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house,—of the first and second cause: ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay.—<br><br>Benvolio.<br> The what?<br> Mercutio. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents!—'By Jesu, a very good blade!—a very tall man!—a very good whore!'—Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardonnez-moi's, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bons, their bons!<br><br>Benvolio.<br> Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!<br> Mercutio. Without his roe, like a dried herring.—O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!—Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in: Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to be-rhyme her; Dido, a dowdy; Cleopatra, a gypsy; Helen and Hero, hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a gray eye or so, but not to the purpose,—<br><br>[Enter Romeo.]<br><br>Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your<br> French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.<br> Romeo.<br> Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?<br> Mercutio.<br> The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?<br> Romeo. Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.<br><br>Mercutio. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.<br><br>Romeo.<br> Meaning, to court'sy.<br> Mercutio.<br> Thou hast most kindly hit it.<br> Romeo.<br> A most courteous exposition.<br> Mercutio.<br> Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.<br> Romeo.<br> Pink for flower.<br> Mercutio.<br> Right.<br> Romeo.<br> Why, then is my pump well-flowered.<br> Mercutio. Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump;that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, sole singular.<br><br>Romeo.<br> O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!<br> Mercutio.<br> Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.<br> Romeo.<br> Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I'll cry a match.<br> Mercutio. Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done; for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five: was I with you there for the goose?<br><br>Romeo. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.<br><br>Mercutio.<br> I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.<br> Romeo.<br> Nay, good goose, bite not.<br> Mercutio. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.<br><br>Romeo.<br> And is it not, then, well served in to a sweet goose?<br> Mercutio. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!<br><br>Romeo. I stretch it out for that word broad: which added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.<br><br>Mercutio. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.<br><br>Benvolio.<br> Stop there, stop there.<br> Mercutio.<br> Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.<br> Benvolio.<br> Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.<br> Mercutio. O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer.<br><br>Romeo.<br> Here's goodly gear!<br> [Enter Nurse and Peter.]<br><br>Mercutio.<br> A sail, a sail, a sail!<br> Benvolio.<br> Two, two; a shirt and a smock.<br> Nurse.<br> Peter!<br> Peter.<br> Anon.<br> Nurse.<br> My fan, Peter.<br> Mercutio.<br> Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face.<br> Nurse.<br> God ye good morrow, gentlemen.<br> Mercutio.<br> God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.<br> Nurse.<br> Is it good-den?<br> Mercutio. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.<br><br>Nurse.<br> Out upon you! what a man are you!<br> Romeo.<br> One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.<br> Nurse.<br> By my troth, it is well said;—for himself to mar, quoth<br> 'a?—Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young<br> Romeo?<br> Romeo. I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.<br><br>Nurse.<br> You say well.<br> Mercutio. Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely, wisely.<br><br>Nurse.<br> If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.<br> Benvolio.<br> She will indite him to some supper.<br> Mercutio.<br> A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!<br> Romeo.<br> What hast thou found?<br> Mercutio.<br> No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is<br> something stale and hoar ere it be spent.<br> [Sings.]<br> An old hare hoar,<br> And an old hare hoar,<br> Is very good meat in Lent;<br> But a hare that is hoar<br> Is too much for a score<br> When it hoars ere it be spent.<br> Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner thither.<br><br>Romeo.<br> I will follow you.<br> Mercutio. Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,— [singing] lady, lady, lady.<br><br>[Exeunt Mercutio, and Benvolio.]<br><br>Nurse. Marry, farewell!—I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery?<br><br>Romeo. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk; and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.<br><br>Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an'a were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!<br><br>Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.<br><br>Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave!—Pray you, sir, a word: and, as I told you, my young lady bid me enquire you out; what she bade me say I will keep to myself: but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say: for the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.<br><br>Romeo. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto thee,—<br><br>Nurse.<br> Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much: Lord,<br> Lord, she will be a joyful woman.<br> Romeo.<br> What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.<br> Nurse. I will tell her, sir,—that you do protest: which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.<br><br>Romeo.<br> Bid her devise some means to come to shrift<br> This afternoon;<br> And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell<br> Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.<br> Nurse.<br> No, truly, sir; not a penny.<br> Romeo.<br> Go to; I say you shall.<br> Nurse.<br> This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.<br> Romeo.<br> And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey-wall:<br> Within this hour my man shall be with thee,<br> And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;<br> Which to the high top-gallant of my joy<br> Must be my convoy in the secret night.<br> Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:<br> Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.<br> Nurse.<br> Now God in heaven bless thee!—Hark you, sir.<br> Romeo.<br> What say'st thou, my dear nurse?<br> Nurse.<br> Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,<br> Two may keep counsel, putting one away?<br> Romeo.<br> I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.<br> Nurse. Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady.—Lord, Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing,—O, there's a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?<br><br>Romeo.<br> Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.<br> Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the dog: no; I know it begins with some other letter:—and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.<br><br>Romeo.<br> Commend me to thy lady.<br> Nurse.<br> Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.]—Peter!<br> Peter.<br> Anon?<br> Nurse.<br> Peter, take my fan, and go before.<br> [Exeunt.]<br><br>Scene V. Capulet's Garden.<br><br>[Enter Juliet.]<br><br>Juliet.<br> The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;<br> In half an hour she promis'd to return.<br> Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.—<br> O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,<br> Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,<br> Driving back shadows over lowering hills:<br> Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,<br> And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.<br> Now is the sun upon the highmost hill<br> Of this day's journey; and from nine till twelve<br> Is three long hours,—yet she is not come.<br> Had she affections and warm youthful blood,<br> She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;<br> My words would bandy her to my sweet love,<br> And his to me:<br> But old folks, many feign as they were dead;<br> Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.—<br> O God, she comes!<br> [Enter Nurse and Peter].<br> O honey nurse, what news?<br> Hast thou met with him?

Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;—what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!<br><br>Benvolio.

Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!<br><br>Benvolio.<br> We talk here in the public haunt of men:<br> Either withdraw unto some private place,<br> And reason coldly of your grievances,<br> Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.<br> Mercutio.<br> Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;<br> I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.<br> Tybalt.<br> Well, peace be with you, sir.—Here comes my man.<br> [Enter Romeo.]<br><br>Mercutio.<br> But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:<br> Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;<br> Your worship in that sense may call him man.<br> Tybalt.<br> Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford<br> No better term than this,—Thou art a villain.<br> Romeo.<br> Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee<br> Doth much excuse the appertaining rage<br> To such a greeting.

Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.<br><br>Tybalt.<br> I am for you.
