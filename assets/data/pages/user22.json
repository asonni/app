Many had lost their boots<br>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;<br>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots<br>Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.<br><br>Gas!

Tut-tut!'<br>And the Big Gun guffawed.<br><br>Another sighed, - 'O Mother, Mother! Dad!'<br>Then smiled, at nothing, childlike, being dead.<br>And the lofty Shrapnel-cloud<br>Leisurely gestured, - 'Fool!'<br>And the falling splinters tittered.<br><br>'My Love!' one moaned. Love-languid seemed his mood,<br>Till, slowly lowered, his whole face kissed the mud.<br>And the Bayonets' long teeth grinned;<br>Rabbles of Shells hooted and groaned;<br>And the Gas hissed.</p>"}
