Take in His light,<br> Who makes thy cares more short than night.<br> The joys which with His day-star rise<br> He deals to all but drowsy eyes ;<br> And, what the men of this world miss<br> Some drops and dews of future bliss.<br><br>Hark ! how His winds have chang'd their note !<br> And with warm whispers call thee out ;<br> The frosts are past, the storms are gone,<br> And backward life at last comes on.<br> The lofty groves in express joys<br> Reply unto the turtle's voice ;<br> And here in dust and dirt, O here<br> The lilies of His love appear !"
