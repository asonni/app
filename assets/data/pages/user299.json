				"main_text": "What is the boy now, who has lost his ball,<br>What, what is he to do? I saw it go<br>Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then<br>Merrily over-there it is in the water!<br>No use to say 'O there are other balls':<br>An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy<br>As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down<br>All his young days into the harbour where<br>His ball went. I would not intrude on him,<br>A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now<br>He senses first responsibility<br>In a world of possessions. People will take balls,<br>Balls will be lost always, little boy,<br>And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.<br>He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,<br>The epistemology of loss, how to stand up<br>Knowing what every man must one day know<br>And most know many days, how to stand up<br>And gradually light returns to the street<br>A whistle blows, the ball is out of sight,<br>Soon part of me will explore the deep and dark<br>Floor of the harbour . . I am everywhere,<br>I suffer and move, my mind and my heart move<br>With all that move me, under the water<br>Or whistling, I am not a little boy."
