				"main_text": "A sudden blow: the great wings beating still<br> Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed<br> By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,<br> He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.<br> <br> How can those terrified vague fingers push<br> The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?<br> And how can body, laid in that white rush,<br> But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?<br> <br> A shudder in the loins engenders there<br> The broken wall, the burning roof and tower<br> And Agamemnon dead.<br> Being so caught up,<br> So mastered by the brute blood of the air,<br> Did she put on his knowledge with his power<br> Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?<br> <br> <br> <br> Never give all the heart<br> W. B. Yeats<br> <br> Never give all the heart, for love<br> Will hardly seem worth thinking of<br> To passionate women if it seem<br> Certain, and they never dream<br> That it fades out from kiss to kiss;<br> For everything that's lovely is<br> But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.<br> O never give the heart outright,<br> For they, for all smooth lips can say,<br> Have given their hearts up to the play.<br> And who could play it well enough<br> If deaf and dumb and blind with love?<br> He that made this knows all the cost,<br> For he gave all his heart and lost."
