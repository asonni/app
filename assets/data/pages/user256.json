				"main_text": "What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?<br>Only the monstrous anger of the guns.<br>Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle<br>Can patter out their hasty orisons.<br>No mockeries for them; no prayers nor bells,<br>Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, <br>The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;<br>And bugles calling for them from sad shires.<br><br>What candles may be held to speed them all?<br>Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes<br>Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.<br>The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;<br>Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,<br>And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds."
