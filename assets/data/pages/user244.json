				"main_text": "When I see birches bend to left and right<br>Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>I like to think some boy's been swinging them.<br>But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay<br>As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br>As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust-<br>Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br>And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br>So low for long, they never right themselves:<br>You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br>Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br>Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br>Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.<br>But I was going to say when Truth broke in<br>With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm<br>I should prefer to have some boy bend them<br>As he went out and in to fetch the cows-<br>Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,<br>Whose only play was what he found himself,<br>Summer or winter, and could play alone.<br>One by one he subdued his father's trees<br>By riding them down over and over again<br>Until he took the stiffness out of them,<br>And not one but hung limp, not one was left<br>For him to conquer. He learned all there was<br>To learn about not launching out too soon<br>And so not carrying the tree away<br>Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise<br>To the top branches, climbing carefully<br>With the same pains you use to fill a cup<br>Up to the brim, and even above the brim.<br>Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,<br>Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.<br>So was I once myself a swinger of birches.<br>And so I dream of going back to be.<br>It's when I'm weary of considerations,<br>And life is too much like a pathless wood<br>Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs<br>Broken across it, and one eye is weeping<br>From a twig's having lashed across it open.<br>I'd like to get away from earth awhile<br>And then come back to it and begin over.<br>May no fate willfully misunderstand me<br>And half grant what I wish and snatch me away<br>Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:<br>I don't know where it's likely to go better.<br>I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,<br>And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk<br>Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<br>But dipped its top and set me down again.<br>That would be good both going and coming back.<br>One could do worse than be a swinger of birches."
