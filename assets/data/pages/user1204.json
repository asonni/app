To feel that I have lost her.<br><br><br><br>To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.<br><br>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br><br><br><br>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br><br>The night is starry and she is not with me.<br><br><br><br>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br><br>My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br><br><br>My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br><br>My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br><br><br><br>The same night whitening the same trees.<br><br>We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br><br><br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.<br><br>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.<br><br><br><br>Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.<br><br>Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.<br><br><br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br><br>Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br><br><br><br>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br><br>my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br><br><br>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br><br>and these the last verses that I write for her.",
