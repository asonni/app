Pietro Lombardo<br> came not by usura<br> Duccio came not by usura<br> nor Pier della Francesca; Zuan Bellin' not by usura<br> nor was 'La Calunnia' painted.<br> Came not by usura Angelico; came not Ambrogio Praedis,<br> Came no church of cut stone signed: Adamo me fecit.<br> Not by usura St Trophime<br> Not by usura Saint Hilaire,<br> Usura rusteth the chisel<br> It rusteth the craft and the craftsman<br> It gnaweth the thread in the loom<br> None learneth to weave gold in her pattern;<br> Azure hath a canker by usura; cramoisi is unbroidered<br> Emerald findeth no Memling<br> Usura slayeth the child in the womb<br> It stayeth the young man's courting<br> It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth<br> between the young bride and her bridegroom<br> CONTRA NATURAM<br> They have brought whores for Eleusis<br> Corpses are set to banquet<br> at behest of usura.<br> <br> <br> N.B. Usury: A charge for the use of purchasing power, levied without regard to production; often without regard to the possibilities of production. (Hence the failure of the Medici bank.)"
