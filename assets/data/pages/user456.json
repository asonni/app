				"main_text": "I tell you hopeless grief is passionless,<br> That only men incredulous of despair,<br> Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air<br> Beat upward to God's throne in loud access<br> Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness<br> In souls, as countries, lieth silent-bare<br> Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare<br> Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express<br> Grief for thy dead in silence like to death <br> Most like a monumental statue set<br> In everlasting watch and moveless woe<br> Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.<br> Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet;<br> If it could weep, it could arise and go."
