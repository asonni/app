				"main_text": "There was never a sound beside the wood but one,<br>And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.<br>What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;<br>Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,<br>Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound-<br>And that was why it whispered and did not speak.<br>It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,<br>Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:<br>Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak<br>To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,<br>Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers<br>(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.<br>The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.<br>My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make."
