				"main_text": "When I have fears that I may cease to be<br> Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,<br> Before high piled books, in charact'ry,<br> Hold like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain;<br> When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,<br> Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,<br> And think that I may never live to trace<br> Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;<br> And when I feel, fair creature of an hour!<br> That I shall never look upon thee more,<br> Never have relish in the faery power<br> Of unreflecting love;-then on the shore<br> Of the wide world I stand alone, and think,<br> Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink."
