{"id":"user79","title":"Henry James","exclude_from_menu":"true","image":"Murat Tasiroglu.jpg","main_text":"CHAPTER I<br> <br> The poor young man hesitated and procrastinated: it cost him such an effort to broach the subject of terms, to speak of money to a person who spoke only of feelings and, as it were, of the aristocracy. Yet he was unwilling to take leave, treating his engagement as settled, without some more conventional glance in that direction than he could find an opening for in the manner of the large affable lady who sat there drawing a pair of soiled gants de Suede through a fat jewelled hand and, at once pressing and gliding, repeated over and over everything but the thing he would have liked to hear. He would have liked to hear the figure of his salary; but just as he was nervously about to sound that note the little boy came back--the little boy Mrs. Moreen had sent out of the room to fetch her fan. He came back without the fan, only with the casual observation that he couldn't find it. As he dropped this cynical confession he looked straight and hard at the candidate for the honour of taking his education in hand. This personage reflected somewhat grimly that the thing he should have to teach his little charge would be to appear to address himself to his mother when he spoke to her--especially not to make her such an improper answer as that.<br> <br> When Mrs. Moreen bethought herself of this pretext for getting rid of their companion Pemberton supposed it was precisely to approach the delicate subject of his remuneration. But it had been only to say some things about her son that it was better a boy of eleven shouldn't catch. They were extravagantly to his advantage save when she lowered her voice to sigh, tapping her left side familiarly, ‘And all overclouded by _this_, you know; all at the mercy of a weakness--!’ Pemberton gathered that the weakness was in the region of the heart. He had known the poor child was not robust: this was the basis on which he had been invited to treat, through an English lady, an Oxford acquaintance, then at Nice, who happened to know both his needs and those of the amiable American family looking out for something really superior in the way of a resident tutor.<br> <br> The young man's impression of his prospective pupil, who had come into the room as if to see for himself the moment Pemberton was admitted, was not quite the soft solicitation the visitor had taken for granted. Morgan Moreen was somehow sickly without being ‘delicate,’ and that he looked intelligent--it is true Pemberton wouldn't have enjoyed his being stupid--only added to the suggestion that, as with his big mouth and big ears he really couldn't be called pretty, he might too utterly fail to please. Pemberton was modest, was even timid; and the chance that his small scholar might prove cleverer than himself had quite figured, to his anxiety, among the dangers of an untried experiment. He reflected, however, that these were risks one had to run when one accepted a position, as it was called, in a private family; when as yet one's university honours had, pecuniarily speaking, remained barren. At any rate when Mrs. Moreen got up as to intimate that, since it was understood he would enter upon his duties within the week she would let him off now, he succeeded, in spite of the presence of the child, in squeezing out a phrase about the rate of payment. It was not the fault of the conscious smile which seemed a reference to the lady's expensive identity, it was not the fault of this demonstration, which had, in a sort, both vagueness and point, if the allusion didn't sound rather vulgar. This was exactly because she became still more gracious to reply: ‘Oh I can assure you that all that will be quite regular.’<br> <br> Pemberton only wondered, while he took up his hat, what ‘all that’ was to amount to--people had such different ideas. Mrs. Moreen's words, however, seemed to commit the family to a pledge definite enough to elicit from the child a strange little comment in the shape of the mocking foreign ejaculation ‘Oh la-la!’<br> <br> Pemberton, in some confusion, glanced at him as he walked slowly to the window with his back turned, his hands in his pockets and the air in his elderly shoulders of a boy who didn't play. The young man wondered if he should be able to teach him to play, though his mother had said it would never do and that this was why school was impossible. Mrs. Moreen exhibited no discomfiture; she only continued blandly: ‘Mr. Moreen will be delighted to meet your wishes. As I told you, he has been called to London for a week. As soon as he comes back you shall have it out with him.’<br> <br> This was so frank and friendly that the young man could only reply, laughing as his hostess laughed: ‘Oh I don't imagine we shall have much of a battle.’<br> <br> ‘They'll give you anything you like,’ the boy remarked unexpectedly, returning from the window. ‘We don't mind what anything costs--we live awfully well.’<br> <br> ‘My darling, you're too quaint!’ his mother exclaimed, putting out to caress him a practised but ineffectual hand. He slipped out of it, but looked with intelligent innocent eyes at Pemberton, who had already had time to notice that from one moment to the other his small satiric face seemed to change its time of life. At this moment it was infantine, yet it appeared also to be under the influence of curious intuitions and knowledges. Pemberton rather disliked precocity and was disappointed to find gleams of it in a disciple not yet in his teens. Nevertheless he divined on the spot that Morgan wouldn't prove a bore. He would prove on the contrary a source of agitation. This idea held the young man, in spite of a certain repulsion.<br> <br> ‘You pompous little person! We're not extravagant!’ Mrs. Moreen gaily protested, making another unsuccessful attempt to draw the boy to her side. ‘You must know what to expect,’ she went on to Pemberton.<br> <br> ‘The less you expect the better!’ her companion interposed. ‘But we _are_ people of fashion.’<br> <br> ‘Only so far as _you_ make us so!’ Mrs. Moreen tenderly mocked. ‘Well then, on Friday--don't tell me you're superstitious--and mind you don't fail us. Then you'll see us all. I'm so sorry the girls are out. I guess you'll like the girls. And, you know, I've another son, quite different from this one.’<br> <br> ‘He tries to imitate me,’ Morgan said to their friend.<br> <br> ‘He tries? Why he's twenty years old!’ cried Mrs. Moreen.<br> <br> ‘You're very witty,’ Pemberton remarked to the child--a proposition his mother echoed with enthusiasm, declaring Morgan's sallies to be the delight of the house.<br> <br> The boy paid no heed to this; he only enquired abruptly of the visitor, who was surprised afterwards that he hadn't struck him as offensively forward: ‘Do you _want_ very much to come?’<br> <br> ‘Can you doubt it after such a description of what I shall hear?’ Pemberton replied. Yet he didn't want to come at all; he was coming because he had to go somewhere, thanks to the collapse of his fortune at the end of a year abroad spent on the system of putting his scant patrimony into a single full wave of experience. He had had his full wave but couldn't pay the score at his inn. Moreover he had caught in the boy's eyes the glimpse of a far-off appeal.<br> <br> ‘Well, I'll do the best I can for you,’ said Morgan; with which he turned away again. He passed out of one of the long windows; Pemberton saw him go and lean on the parapet of the terrace. He remained there while the young man took leave of his mother, who, on Pemberton's looking as if he expected a farewell from him, interposed with: ‘Leave him, leave him; he's so strange!’ Pemberton supposed her to fear something he might say. ‘He's a genius--you'll love him,’ she added. ‘He's much the most interesting person in the family.’ And before he could invent some civility to oppose to this she wound up with: ‘But we're all good, you know!’<br> <br> ‘He's a genius--you'll love him!’ were words that recurred to our aspirant before the Friday, suggesting among many things that geniuses were not invariably loveable. However, it was all the better if there was an element that would make tutorship absorbing: he had perhaps taken too much for granted it would only disgust him. As he left the villa after his interview he looked up at the balcony and saw the child leaning over it. ‘We shall have great larks!’ he called up.<br> <br> Morgan hung fire a moment and then gaily returned: ‘By the time you come back I shall have thought of something witty!’<br> <br> This made Pemberton say to himself ‘After all he's rather nice.’<br> <br>CHAPTER II<br> <br> On the Friday he saw them all, as Mrs. Moreen had promised, for her husband had come back and the girls and the other son were at home. Mr. Moreen had a white moustache, a confiding manner and, in his buttonhole, the ribbon of a foreign order--bestowed, as Pemberton eventually learned, for services. For what services he never clearly ascertained: this was a point--one of a large number--that Mr. Moreen's manner never confided. What it emphatically did confide was that he was even more a man of the world than you might first make out. Ulick, the firstborn, was in visible training for the same profession--under the disadvantage as yet, however, of a buttonhole but feebly floral and a moustache with no pretensions to type. The girls had hair and figures and manners and small fat feet, but had never been out alone. As for Mrs. Moreen Pemberton saw on a nearer view that her elegance was intermittent and her parts didn't always match. Her husband, as she had promised, met with enthusiasm Pemberton's ideas in regard to a salary. The young man had endeavoured to keep these stammerings modest, and Mr. Moreen made it no secret that _he_ found them wanting in ‘style.’ He further mentioned that he aspired to be intimate with his children, to be their best friend, and that he was always looking out for them. That was what he went off for, to London and other places--to look out; and this vigilance was the theory of life, as well as the real occupation, of the whole family. They all looked out, for they were very frank on the subject of its being necessary. They desired it to be understood that they were earnest people, and also that their fortune, though quite adequate for earnest people, required the most careful administration. Mr. Moreen, as the parent bird, sought sustenance for the nest. Ulick invoked support mainly at the club, where Pemberton guessed that it was usually served on green cloth. The girls used to do up their hair and their frocks themselves, and our young man felt appealed to to be glad, in regard to Morgan's education, that, though it must naturally be of the best, it didn't cost too much. After a little he _was_ glad, forgetting at times his own needs in the interest inspired by the child's character and culture and the pleasure of making easy terms for him.<br> <br> During the first weeks of their acquaintance Morgan had been as puzzling as a page in an unknown language--altogether different from the obvious little Anglo-Saxons who had misrepresented childhood to Pemberton. Indeed the whole mystic volume in which the boy had been amateurishly bound demanded some practice in translation. To-day, after a considerable interval, there is something phantasmagoria, like a prismatic reflexion or a serial novel, in Pemberton's memory of the queerness of the Moreens. If it were not for a few tangible tokens--a lock of Morgan's hair cut by his own hand, and the half-dozen letters received from him when they were disjoined--the whole episode and the figures peopling it would seem too inconsequent for anything but dreamland. Their supreme quaintness was their success--as it appeared to him for a while at the time; since he had never seen a family so brilliantly equipped for failure. Wasn't it success to have kept him so hatefully long? Wasn't it success to have drawn him in that first morning at dejeuner, the Friday he came--it was enough to _make_ one superstitious--so that he utterly committed himself, and this not by calculation or on a signal, but from a happy instinct which made them, like a band of gipsies, work so neatly together? They amused him as much as if they had really been a band of gipsies. He was still young and had not seen much of the world--his English years had been properly arid; therefore the reversed conventions of the Moreens--for they had _their_ desperate proprieties--struck him as topsy-turvy. He had encountered nothing like them at Oxford; still less had any such note been struck to his younger American ear during the four years at Yale in which he had richly supposed himself to be reacting against a Puritan strain. The reaction of the Moreens, at any rate, went ever so much further. He had thought himself very sharp that first day in hitting them all off in his mind with the ‘cosmopolite’ label. Later it seemed feeble and colourless--confessedly helplessly provisional.<br> <br> He yet when he first applied it felt a glow of joy--for an instructor he was still empirical--rise from the apprehension that living with them would really he to see life. Their sociable strangeness was an intimation of that--their chatter of tongues, their gaiety and good humour, their infinite dawdling (they were always getting themselves up, but it took forever, and Pemberton had once found Mr. Moreen shaving in the drawing-room), their French, their Italian and, cropping up in the foreign fluencies, their cold tough slices of American. They lived on macaroni and coffee--they had these articles prepared in perfection--but they knew recipes for a hundred other dishes. They overflowed with music and song, were always humming and catching each other up, and had a sort of professional acquaintance with Continental cities. They talked of ‘good places’ as if they had been pickpockets or strolling players. They had at Nice a villa, a carriage, a piano and a banjo, and they went to official parties. They were a perfect calendar of the ‘days’ of their friends, which Pemberton knew them, when they were indisposed, to get out of bed to go to, and which made the week larger than life when Mrs. Moreen talked of them with Paula and Amy. Their initiations gave their new inmate at first an almost dazzling sense of culture. Mrs. Moreen had translated something at some former period--an author whom it made Pemberton feel borne never to have heard of. They could imitate Venetian and sing Neapolitan, and when they wanted to say something very particular communicated with each other in an ingenious dialect of their own, an elastic spoken cipher which Pemberton at first took for some patois of one of their countries, but which he ‘caught on to’ as he would not have grasped provincial development of Spanish or German.<br> <br> ‘It's the family language--Ultramoreen,’ Morgan explained to him drolly enough; but the boy rarely condescended to use it himself, though he dealt in colloquial Latin as if he had been a little prelate.<br> <br> Among all the ‘days’ with which Mrs. Moreen's memory was taxed she managed to squeeze in one of her own, which her friends sometimes forgot. But the house drew a frequented air from the number of fine people who were freely named there and from several mysterious men with foreign titles and English clothes whom Morgan called the princes and who, on sofas with the girls, talked French very loud--though sometimes with some oddity of accent--as if to show they were saying nothing improper. Pemberton wondered how the princes could ever propose in that tone and so publicly: he took for granted cynically that this was what was desired of them. Then he recognised that even for the chance of such an advantage Mrs. Moreen would never allow Paula and Amy to receive alone. These young ladies were not at all timid, but it was just the safeguards that made them so candidly free. It was a houseful of Bohemians who wanted tremendously to be Philistines.<br> <br> In one respect, however, certainly they achieved no rigour--they were wonderfully amiable and ecstatic about Morgan. It was a genuine tenderness, an artless admiration, equally strong in each. They even praised his beauty, which was small, and were as afraid of him as if they felt him of finer clay. They spoke of him as a little angel and a prodigy--they touched on his want of health with long vague faces. Pemberton feared at first an extravagance that might make him hate the boy, but before this happened he had become extravagant himself. Later, when he had grown rather to hate the others, it was a bribe to patience for him that they were at any rate nice about Morgan, going on tiptoe if they fancied he was showing symptoms, and even giving up somebody's ‘day’ to procure him a pleasure. Mixed with this too was the oddest wish to make him independent, as if they had felt themselves not good enough for him. They passed him over to the new members of their circle very much as if wishing to force some charity of adoption on so free an agent and get rid of their own charge. They were delighted when they saw Morgan take so to his kind playfellow, and could think of no higher praise for the young man. It was strange how they contrived to reconcile the appearance, and indeed the essential fact, of adoring the child with their eagerness to wash their hands of him. Did they want to get rid of him before he should find them out? Pemberton was finding them out month by month. The boy's fond family, however this might be, turned their backs with exaggerated delicacy, as if to avoid the reproach of interfering. Seeing in time how little he had in common with them--it was by _them_ he first observed it; they proclaimed it with complete humility--his companion was moved to speculate on the mysteries of transmission, the far jumps of heredity. Where his detachment from most of the things they represented had come from was more than an observer could say--it certainly had burrowed under two or three generations.<br> <br> As for Pemberton's own estimate of his pupil, it was a good while before he got the point of view, so little had he been prepared for it by the smug young barbarians to whom the tradition of tutorship, as hitherto revealed to him, had been adjusted. Morgan was scrappy and surprising, deficient in many properties supposed common to the genus and abounding in others that were the portion only of the supernaturally clever. One day his friend made a great stride: it cleared up the question to perceive that Morgan _was_ supernaturally clever and that, though the formula was temporarily meagre, this would be the only assumption on which one could successfully deal with him. He had the general quality of a child for whom life had not been simplified by school, a kind of homebred sensibility which might have been as bad for himself but was charming for others, and a whole range of refinement and perception--little musical vibrations as taking as picked-up airs--begotten by wandering about Europe at the tail of his migratory tribe. This might not have been an education to recommend in advance, but its results with so special a subject were as appreciable as the marks on a piece of fine porcelain. There was at the same time in him a small strain of stoicism, doubtless the fruit of having had to begin early to bear pain, which counted for pluck and made it of less consequence that he might have been thought at school rather a polyglot little beast. Pemberton indeed quickly found himself rejoicing that school was out of the question: in any million of boys it was probably good for all but one, and Morgan was that millionth. It would have made him comparative and superior--it might have made him really require kicking. Pemberton would try to be school himself--a bigger seminary than five hundred grazing donkeys, so that, winning no prizes, the boy would remain unconscious and irresponsible and amusing--amusing, because, though life was already intense in his childish nature, freshness still made there a strong draught for jokes. It turned out that even in the still air of Morgan's various disabilities jokes flourished greatly. He was a pale lean acute undeveloped little cosmopolite, who liked intellectual gymnastics and who also, as regards the behaviour of mankind, had noticed more things than you might suppose, but who nevertheless had his proper playroom of superstitions, where he smashed a dozen toys a day.<br> <br>CHAPTER III<br> <br> At Nice once, toward evening, as the pair rested in the open air after a walk, and looked over the sea at the pink western lights, he said suddenly to his comrade: ‘Do you like it, you know--being with us all in this intimate way?’<br> <br> ‘My dear fellow, why should I stay if I didn't?’<br> <br> ‘How do I know you'll stay? I'm almost sure you won't, very long.’<br> <br> ‘I hope you don't mean to dismiss me,’ said Pemberton.<br> <br> Morgan debated, looking at the sunset. ‘I think if I did right I ought to.’<br> <br> ‘Well, I know I'm supposed to instruct you in virtue; but in that case don't do right.’<br> <br> ‘'You're very young--fortunately,’ Morgan went on, turning to him again.<br> <br> ‘Oh yes, compared with you!’<br> <br> ‘Therefore it won't matter so much if you do lose a lot of time.’<br> <br> ‘That's the way to look at it,’ said Pemberton accommodatingly.<br> <br> They were silent a minute; after which the boy asked: ‘Do you like my father and my mother very much?’<br> <br> ‘Dear me, yes. They're charming people.’<br> <br> Morgan received this with another silence; then unexpectedly, familiarly, but at the same time affectionately, he remarked: ‘You're a jolly old humbug!’<br> <br> For a particular reason the words made our young man change colour. The boy noticed in an instant that he had turned red, whereupon he turned red himself and pupil and master exchanged a longish glance in which there was a consciousness of many more things than are usually touched upon, even tacitly, in such a relation. It produced for Pemberton an embarrassment; it raised in a shadowy form a question--this was the first glimpse of it--destined to play a singular and, as he imagined, owing to the altogether peculiar conditions, an unprecedented part in his intercourse with his little companion. Later, when he found himself talking with the youngster in a way in which few youngsters could ever have been talked with, he thought of that clumsy moment on the bench at Nice as the dawn of an understanding that had broadened. What had added to the clumsiness then was that he thought it his duty to declare to Morgan that he might abuse him, Pemberton, as much as he liked, but must never abuse his parents. To this Morgan had the easy retort that he hadn't dreamed of abusing them; which appeared to be true: it put Pemberton in the wrong.<br> <br> ‘Then why am I a humbug for saying _I_ think them charming?’ the young man asked, conscious of a certain rashness.<br> <br> ‘Well--they're not your parents.’<br> <br> ‘They love you better than anything in the world--never forget that,’ said Pemberton.<br> <br> ‘Is that why you like them so much?’<br> <br> ‘They're very kind to me,’ Pemberton replied evasively.<br> <br> ‘You _are_ a humbug!’ laughed Morgan, passing an arm into his tutor's. He leaned against him looking oft at the sea again and swinging his long thin legs.<br> <br> ‘Don't kick my shins,’ said Pemberton while he reflected ‘Hang it, I can't complain of them to the child!’<br> <br> ‘There's another reason, too,’ Morgan went on, keeping his legs still.<br> <br> ‘Another reason for what?’<br> <br> ‘Besides their not being your parents.’<br> <br> ‘I don't understand you,’ said Pemberton.<br> <br> ‘Well, you will before long. All right!’<br> <br> He did understand fully before long, but he made a fight even with himself before he confessed it. He thought it the oddest thing to have a struggle with the child about. He wondered he didn't hate the hope of the Moreens for bringing the struggle on. But by the time it began any such sentiment for that scion was closed to him. Morgan was a special case, and to know him was to accept him on his own odd terms. Pemberton had spent his aversion to special cases before arriving at knowledge. When at last he did arrive his quandary was great. Against every interest he had attached himself. They would have to meet things together. Before they went home that evening at Nice the boy had said, clinging to his arm:<br> <br> ‘Well, at any rate you'll hang on to the last.’<br> <br> ‘To the last?’<br> <br> ‘Till you're fairly beaten.’<br> <br> ‘_You_ ought to be fairly beaten!’ cried the young man, drawing him closer.<br> <br>CHAPTER IV<br> <br> A year after he had come to live with them Mr. and Mrs. Moreen suddenly gave up the villa at Nice. Pemberton had got used to suddenness, having seen it practised on a considerable scale during two jerky little tours--one in Switzerland the first summer, and the other late in the winter, when they all ran down to Florence and then, at the end of ten days, liking it much less than they had intended, straggled back in mysterious depression. They had returned to Nice ‘for ever,’ as they said; but this didn't prevent their squeezing, one rainy muggy May night, into a second-class railway-carriage--you could never tell by which class they would travel--where Pemberton helped them to stow away a wonderful collection of bundles and bags. The explanation of this manoeuvre was that they had determined to spend the summer ‘in some bracing place’; but in Paris they dropped into a small furnished apartment--a fourth floor in a third-rate avenue, where there was a smell on the staircase and the portier was hateful--and passed the next four months in blank indigence.<br> <br> The better part of this baffled sojourn was for the preceptor and his pupil, who, visiting the Invalides and Notre Dame, the Conciergerie and all the museums, took a hundred remunerative rambles. They learned to know their Paris, which was useful, for they came back another year for a longer stay, the general character of which in Pemberton's memory to-day mixes pitiably and confusedly with that of the first. He sees Morgan's shabby knickerbockers--the everlasting pair that didn't match his blouse and that as he grew longer could only grow faded. He remembers the particular holes in his three or four pair of coloured stockings.<br> <br> Morgan was dear to his mother, but he never was better dressed than was absolutely necessary--partly, no doubt, by his own fault, for he was as indifferent to his appearance as a German philosopher. ‘My dear fellow, you _are_ coming to pieces,’ Pemberton would say to him in sceptical remonstrance; to which the child would reply, looking at him serenely up and down: ‘My dear fellow, so are you! I don't want to cast you in the shade.’ Pemberton could have no rejoinder for this--the assertion so closely represented the fact. If however the deficiencies of his own wardrobe were a chapter by themselves he didn't like his little charge to look too poor. Later he used to say ‘Well, if we're poor, why, after all, shouldn't we look it?’ and he consoled himself with thinking there was something rather elderly and gentlemanly in Morgan's disrepair--it differed from the untidiness of the urchin who plays and spoils his things. He could trace perfectly the degrees by which, in proportion as her little son confined himself to his tutor for society, Mrs. Moreen shrewdly forbore to renew his garments. She did nothing that didn't show, neglected him because he escaped notice, and then, as he illustrated this clever policy, discouraged at home his public appearances. Her position was logical enough--those members of her family who did show had to be showy.<br> <br> During this period and several others Pemberton was quite aware of how he and his comrade might strike people; wandering languidly through the Jardin des Plantes as if they had nowhere to go, sitting on the winter days in the galleries of the Louvre, so splendidly ironical to the homeless, as if for the advantage of the calorifere. They joked about it sometimes: it was the sort of joke that was perfectly within the boy's compass. They figured themselves as part of the vast vague hand-to-mouth multitude of the enormous city and pretended they were proud of their position in it--it showed them ‘such a lot of life’ and made them conscious of a democratic brotherhood. If Pemberton couldn't feel a sympathy in destitution with his small companion--for after all Morgan's fond parents would never have let him really suffer--the boy would at least feel it with him, so it came to the same thing. He used sometimes to wonder what people would think they were--to fancy they were looked askance at, as if it might be a suspected case of kidnapping. Morgan wouldn't be taken for a young patrician with a preceptor--he wasn't smart enough; though he might pass for his companion's sickly little brother. Now and then he had a five-franc piece, and except once, when they bought a couple of lovely neckties, one of which he made Pemberton accept, they laid it out scientifically in old books. This was sure to be a great day, always spent on the quays, in a rummage of the dusty boxes that garnish the parapets. Such occasions helped them to live, for their books ran low very soon after the beginning of their acquaintance. Pemberton had a good many in England, but he was obliged to write to a friend and ask him kindly to get some fellow to give him something for them.<br> <br> If they had to relinquish that summer the advantage of the bracing climate the young man couldn't but suspect this failure of the cup when at their very lips to have been the effect of a rude jostle of his own. This had represented his first blow-out, as he called it, with his patrons; his first successful attempt--though there was little other success about it--to bring them to a consideration of his impossible position. As the ostensible eve of a costly journey the moment had struck him as favourable to an earnest protest, the presentation of an ultimatum. Ridiculous as it sounded, he had never yet been able to compass an uninterrupted private interview with the elder pair or with either of them singly. They were always flanked by their elder children, and poor Pemberton usually had his own little charge at his side. He was conscious of its being a house in which the surface of one's delicacy got rather smudged; nevertheless he had preserved the bloom of his scruple against announcing to Mr. and Mrs. Moreen with publicity that he shouldn't be able to go on longer without a little money. He was still simple enough to suppose Ulick and Paula and Amy might not know that since his arrival he had only had a hundred and forty francs; and he was magnanimous enough to wish not to compromise their parents in their eyes. Mr. Moreen now listened to him, as he listened to every one and to every thing, like a man of the world, and seemed to appeal to him--though not of course too grossly--to try and be a little more of one himself. Pemberton recognised in fact the importance of the character--from the advantage it gave Mr. Moreen. He was not even confused or embarrassed, whereas the young man in his service was more so than there was any reason for. Neither was he surprised--at least any more than a gentleman had to be who freely confessed himself a little shocked--though not perhaps strictly at Pemberton.<br> <br> ‘We must go into this, mustn't we, dear?’ he said to his wife. He assured his young friend that the matter should have his very best attention; and he melted into space as elusively as if, at the door, he were taking an inevitable but deprecatory precedence. When, the next moment, Pemberton found himself alone with Mrs. Moreen it was to hear her say ‘I see, I see’--stroking the roundness of her chin and looking as if she were only hesitating between a dozen easy remedies. If they didn't make their push Mr. Moreen could at least disappear for several days. During his absence his wife took up the subject again spontaneously, but her contribution to it was merely that she had thought all the while they were getting on so beautifully. Pemberton's reply to this revelation was that unless they immediately put down something on account he would leave them on the spot and for ever. He knew she would wonder how he would get away, and for a moment expected her to enquire. She didn't, for which he was almost grateful to her, so little was he in a position to tell.<br> <br> ‘You won't, you _know_ you won't--you're too interested,’ she said. ‘You are interested, you know you are, you dear kind man!’ She laughed with almost condemnatory archness, as if it were a reproach--though she wouldn't insist; and flirted a soiled pocket-handkerchief at him.<br> <br> Pemberton's mind was fully made up to take his step the following week. This would give him time to get an answer to a letter he had despatched to England. If he did in the event nothing of the sort--that is if he stayed another year and then went away only for three months--it was not merely because before the answer to his letter came (most unsatisfactory when it did arrive) Mr. Moreen generously counted out to him, and again with the sacrifice to ‘form’ of a marked man of the world, three hundred francs in elegant ringing gold. He was irritated to find that Mrs. Moreen was right, that he couldn't at the pinch bear to leave the child. This stood out clearer for the very reason that, the night of his desperate appeal to his patrons, he had seen fully for the first time where he was. Wasn't it another proof of the success with which those patrons practised their arts that they had managed to avert for so long the illuminating flash? It descended on our friend with a breadth of effect which perhaps would have struck a spectator as comical, after he had returned to his little servile room, which looked into a close court where a bare dirty opposite wall took, with the sound of shrill clatter, the reflexion of lighted back windows. He had simply given himself away to a band of adventurers. The idea, the word itself, wore a romantic horror for him--he had always lived on such safe lines. Later it assumed a more interesting, almost a soothing, sense: it pointed a moral, and Pemberton could enjoy a moral. The Moreens were adventurers not merely because they didn't pay their debts, because they lived on society, but because their whole view of life, dim and confused and instinctive, like that of clever colour-blind animals, was speculative and rapacious and mean. Oh they were ‘respectable,’ and that only made them more immondes. The young man's analysis, while he brooded, put it at last very simply--they were adventurers because they were toadies and snobs. That was the completest account of them--it was the law of their being. Even when this truth became vivid to their ingenious inmate he remained unconscious of how much his mind had been prepared for it by the extraordinary little boy who had now become such a complication in his life. Much less could he then calculate on the information he was still to owe the extraordinary little boy.<br> <br>CHAPTER V<br> <br> But it was during the ensuing time that the real problem came up--the problem of how far it was excusable to discuss the turpitude of parents with a child of twelve, of thirteen, of fourteen. Absolutely inexcusable and quite impossible it of course at first appeared; and indeed the question didn't press for some time after Pemberton had received his three hundred francs. They produced a temporary lull, a relief from the sharpest pressure. The young man frugally amended his wardrobe and even had a few francs in his pocket. He thought the Moreens looked at him as if he were almost too smart, as if they ought to take care not to spoil him. If Mr. Moreen hadn't been such a man of the world he would perhaps have spoken of the freedom of such neckties on the part of a subordinate. But Mr. Moreen was always enough a man of the world to let things pass--he had certainly shown that. It was singular how Pemberton guessed that Morgan, though saying nothing about it, knew something had happened. But three hundred francs, especially when one owed money, couldn't last for ever; and when the treasure was gone--the boy knew when it had failed--Morgan did break ground. The party had returned to Nice at the beginning of the winter, but not to the charming villa. They went to an hotel, where they stayed three months, and then moved to another establishment, explaining that they had left the first because, after waiting and waiting, they couldn't get the rooms they wanted. These apartments, the rooms they wanted, were generally very splendid; but fortunately they never _could_ get them--fortunately, I mean, for Pemberton, who reflected always that if they had got them there would have been a still scantier educational fund. What Morgan said at last was said suddenly, irrelevantly, when the moment came, in the middle of a lesson, and consisted of the apparently unfeeling words: ‘You ought to filer, you know--you really ought.’<br> <br> Pemberton stared. He had learnt enough French slang from Morgan to know that to filer meant to cut sticks. ‘Ah my dear fellow, don't turn me off!’<br> <br> Morgan pulled a Greek lexicon toward him--he used a Greek-German--to look out a word, instead of asking it of Pemberton. ‘You can't go on like this, you know.’<br> <br> ‘Like what, my boy?’<br> <br> ‘You know they don't pay you up,’ said Morgan, blushing and turning his leaves.<br> <br> ‘Don't pay me?’ Pemberton stared again and feigned amazement. ‘What on earth put that into your head?’<br> <br> ‘It has been there a long time,’ the boy replied rummaging his book.<br> <br> Pemberton was silent, then he went on: ‘I say, what are you hunting for? They pay me beautifully.’<br> <br> ‘I'm hunting for the Greek for awful whopper,’ Morgan dropped.<br> <br> ‘Find that rather for gross impertinence and disabuse your mind. What do I want of money?’<br> <br> ‘Oh that's another question!’<br> <br> Pemberton wavered--he was drawn in different ways. The severely correct thing would have been to tell the boy that such a matter was none of his business and bid him go on with his lines. But they were really too intimate for that; it was not the way he was in the habit of treating him; there had been no reason it should be. On the other hand Morgan had quite lighted on the truth--he really shouldn't be able to keep it up much longer; therefore why not let him know one's real motive for forsaking him? At the same time it wasn't decent to abuse to one's pupil the family of one's pupil; it was better to misrepresent than to do that. So in reply to his comrade's last exclamation he just declared, to dismiss the subject, that he had received several payments.<br> <br> ‘I say--I say!’ the boy ejaculated, laughing.<br> <br> ‘That's all right,’ Pemberton insisted. ‘Give me your written rendering.’<br> <br> Morgan pushed a copybook across the table, and he began to read the page, but with something running in his head that made it no sense. Looking up after a minute or two he found the child's eyes fixed on him and felt in them something strange. Then Morgan said: ‘I'm not afraid of the stern reality.’<br> <br> ‘I haven't yet seen the thing you _are_ afraid of--I'll do you that justice!’<br> <br> This came out with a jump--it was perfectly true--and evidently gave Morgan pleasure. ‘I've thought of it a long time,’ he presently resumed.<br> <br> ‘Well, don't think of it any more.’<br> <br> The boy appeared to comply, and they had a comfortable and even an amusing hour. They had a theory that they were very thorough, and yet they seemed always to be in the amusing part of lessons, the intervals between the dull dark tunnels, where there were waysides and jolly views. Yet the morning was brought to a violent as end by Morgan's suddenly leaning his arms on the table, burying his head in them and bursting into tears: at which Pemberton was the more startled that, as it then came over him, it was the first time he had ever seen the boy cry and that the impression was consequently quite awful.<br> <br> The next day, after much thought, he took a decision and, believing it to be just, immediately acted on it. He cornered Mr. and Mrs. Moreen again and let them know that if on the spot they didn't pay him all they owed him he wouldn't only leave their house but would tell Morgan exactly what had brought him to it.<br> <br> ‘Oh you _haven't_ told him?’ cried Mrs. Moreen with a pacifying hand on her well-dressed bosom.<br> <br> ‘Without warning you? For what do you take me?’ the young man returned.<br> <br> Mr. and Mrs. Moreen looked at each other; he could see that they appreciated, as tending to their security, his superstition of delicacy, and yet that there was a certain alarm in their relief. ‘My dear fellow,’ Mr. Moreen demanded, ‘what use can you have, leading the quiet life we all do, for such a lot of money?’--a question to which Pemberton made no answer, occupied as he was in noting that what passed in the mind of his patrons was something like: ‘Oh then, if we've felt that the child, dear little angel, has judged us and how he regards us, and we haven't been betrayed, he must have guessed--and in short it's _general_!’ an inference that rather stirred up Mr. and Mrs. Moreen, as Pemberton had desired it should. At the same time, if he had supposed his threat would do something towards bringing them round, he was disappointed to find them taking for granted--how vulgar their perception _had_ been!--that he had already given them away. There was a mystic uneasiness in their parental breasts, and that had been the inferior sense of it. None the less however, his threat did touch them; for if they had escaped it was only to meet a new danger. Mr. Moreen appealed to him, on every precedent, as a man of the world; but his wife had recourse, for the first time since his domestication with them, to a fine hauteur, reminding him that a devoted mother, with her child, had arts that protected her against gross misrepresentation.<br> <br> ‘I should misrepresent you grossly if I accused you of common honesty!’ our friend replied; but as he closed the door behind him sharply, thinking he had not done himself much good, while Mr. Moreen lighted another cigarette, he heard his hostess shout after him more touchingly:<br> <br> ‘Oh you do, you _do_, put the knife to one's throat!’<br> <br> The next morning, very early, she came to his room. He recognised her knock, but had no hope she brought him money; as to which he was wrong, for she had fifty francs in her hand. She squeezed forward in her dressing-gown, and he received her in his own, between his bath-tub and his bed. He had been tolerably schooled by this time to the ‘foreign ways’ of his hosts. Mrs. Moreen was ardent, and when she was ardent she didn't care what she did; so she now sat down on his bed, his clothes being on the chairs, and, in her preoccupation, forgot, as she glanced round, to be ashamed of giving him such a horrid room. What Mrs. Moreen's ardour now bore upon was the design of persuading him that in the first place she was very good-natured to bring him fifty francs, and that in the second, if he would only see it, he was really too absurd to expect to be paid. Wasn't he paid enough without perpetual money--wasn't he paid by the comfortable luxurious home he enjoyed with them all, without a care, an anxiety, a solitary want? Wasn't he sure of his position, and wasn't that everything to a young man like him, quite unknown, with singularly little to show, the ground of whose exorbitant pretensions it had never been easy to discover? Wasn't he paid above all by the sweet relation he had established with Morgan--quite ideal as from master to pupil--and by the simple privilege of knowing and living with so amazingly gifted a child; than whom really (and she meant literally what she said) there was no better company in Europe? Mrs. Moreen herself took to appealing to him as a man of the world; she said ‘Voyons, mon cher,’ and ‘My dear man, look here now’; and urged him to be reasonable, putting it before him that it was truly a chance for him. She spoke as if, according as he _should_ be reasonable, he would prove himself worthy to be her son's tutor and of the extraordinary confidence they had placed in him.<br> <br> After all, Pemberton reflected, it was only a difference of theory and the theory didn't matter much. They had hitherto gone on that of remunerated, as now they would go on that of gratuitous, service; but why should they have so many words about it? Mrs. Moreen at all events continued to be convincing; sitting there with her fifty francs she talked and reiterated, as women reiterate, and bored and irritated him, while he leaned against the wall with his hands in the pockets of his wrapper, drawing it together round his legs and looking over the head of his visitor at the grey negations of his window. She wound up with saying: ‘You see I bring you a definite proposal.’<br> <br> ‘A definite proposal?’<br> <br> ‘To make our relations regular, as it were--to put them on a comfortable footing.’<br> <br> ‘I see--it's a system,’ said Pemberton. ‘A kind of organised blackmail.’<br> <br> Mrs. Moreen bounded up, which was exactly what he wanted. ‘What do you mean by that?’<br> <br> ‘You practise on one's fears--one's fears about the child if one should go away.’<br> <br> ‘And pray what would happen to him in that event?’ she demanded, with majesty.<br> <br> ‘Why he'd be alone with _you_.’<br> <br> ‘And pray with whom _should_ a child be but with those whom he loves most?’<br> <br> ‘If you think that, why don't you dismiss me?’<br> <br> ‘Do you pretend he loves you more than he loves _us_?’ cried Mrs. Moreen.<br> <br> ‘I think he ought to. I make sacrifices for him. Though I've heard of those _you_ make I don't see them.’<br> <br> Mrs. Moreen stared a moment; then with emotion she grasped her inmate's hand. ‘_Will_ you make it--the sacrifice?’<br> <br> He burst out laughing. ‘I'll see. I'll do what I can. I'll stay a little longer. Your calculation's just--I _do_ hate intensely to give him up; I'm fond of him and he thoroughly interests me, in spite of the inconvenience I suffer. You know my situation perfectly. I haven't a penny in the world and, occupied as you see me with Morgan, am unable to earn money.’<br> <br> Mrs. Moreen tapped her undressed arm with her folded bank-note. ‘Can't you write articles? Can't you translate as _I_ do?’<br> <br> ‘I don't know about translating; it's wretchedly paid.’<br> <br> ‘I'm glad to earn what I can,’ said Mrs. Moreen with prodigious virtue.<br> <br> ‘You ought to tell me who you do it for.’ Pemberton paused a moment, and she said nothing; so he added: ‘I've tried to turn off some little sketches, but the magazines won't have them--they're declined with thanks.’<br> <br> ‘You see then you're not such a phoenix,’ his visitor pointedly smiled--’to pretend to abilities you're sacrificing for our sake.’<br> <br> ‘I haven't time to do things properly,’ he ruefully went on. Then as it came over him that he was almost abjectly good-natured to give these explanations he added: ‘If I stay on longer it must be on one condition--that Morgan shall know distinctly on what footing I am.’<br> <br> Mrs. Moreen demurred. ‘Surely you don't want to show off to a child?’<br> <br> ‘To show _you_ off, do you mean?’<br> <br> Again she cast about, but this time it was to produce a still finer flower. ‘And _you_ talk of blackmail!’<br> <br> ‘You can easily prevent it,’ said Pemberton.<br> <br> ‘And _you_ talk of practising on fears,’ she bravely pushed on.<br> <br> ‘Yes, there's no doubt I'm a great scoundrel.’<br> <br> His patroness met his eyes--it was clear she was in straits. Then she thrust out her money at him. ‘Mr. Moreen desired me to give you this on account.’<br> <br> ‘I'm much obliged to Mr. Moreen, but we _have_ no account.’<br> <br> ‘You won't take it?’<br> <br> ‘That leaves me more free,’ said Pemberton.<br> <br> ‘To poison my darling's mind?’ groaned Mrs. Moreen.<br> <br> ‘Oh your darling's mind--!’ the young man laughed.<br> <br> She fixed him a moment, and he thought she was going to break out tormentedly, pleadingly: ‘For God's sake, tell me what _is_ in it!’ But she checked this impulse--another was stronger. She pocketed the money--the crudity of the alternative was comical--and swept out of the room with the desperate concession: ‘You may tell him any horror you like!’ <br> <br> CHAPTER VI<br> <br> A couple of days after this, during which he had failed to profit by so free a permission, he had been for a quarter of an hour walking with his charge in silence when the boy became sociable again with the remark: ‘I'll tell you how I know it; I know it through Zenobie.’<br> <br> ‘Zenobie? Who in the world is _she_?’<br> <br> ‘A nurse I used to have--ever so many years ago. A charming woman. I liked her awfully, and she liked me.’<br> <br> ‘There's no accounting for tastes. What is it you know through her?’<br> <br> ‘Why what their idea is. She went away because they didn't fork out. She did like me awfully, and she stayed two years. She told me all about it--that at last she could never get her wages. As soon as they saw how much she liked me they stopped giving her anything. They thought she'd stay for nothing--just _because_, don't you know?’ And Morgan had a queer little conscious lucid look. ‘She did stay ever so long--as long an she could. She was only a poor girl. She used to send money to her mother. At last she couldn't afford it any longer, and went away in a fearful rage one night--I mean of course in a rage against _them_. She cried over me tremendously, she hugged me nearly to death. She told me all about it,’ the boy repeated. ‘She told me it was their idea. So I guessed, ever so long ago, that they have had the same idea with you.’<br> <br> ‘Zenobie was very sharp,’ said Pemberton. ‘And she made you so.’<br> <br> ‘Oh that wasn't Zenobie; that was nature. And experience!’ Morgan laughed.<br> <br> ‘Well, Zenobie was a part of your experience.’<br> <br> ‘Certainly I was a part of hers, poor dear!’ the boy wisely sighed. ‘And I'm part of yours.’<br> <br> ‘A very important part. But I don't see how you know that I've been treated like Zenobie.’<br> <br> ‘Do you take me for the biggest dunce you've known?’ Morgan asked. ‘Haven't I been conscious of what we've been through together?’<br> <br> ‘What we've been through?’<br> <br> ‘Our privations--our dark days.’<br> <br> ‘Oh our days have been bright enough.’<br> <br> Morgan went on in silence for a moment. Then he said: ‘My dear chap, you're a hero!’<br> <br> ‘Well, you're another!’ Pemberton retorted.<br> <br> ‘No I'm not, but I ain't a baby. I won't stand it any longer. You must get some occupation that pays. I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed!’ quavered the boy with a ring of passion, like some high silver note from a small cathedral cloister, that deeply touched his friend.<br> <br> ‘We ought to go off and live somewhere together,’ the young man said.<br> <br> ‘I'll go like a shot if you'll take me.’<br> <br> ‘I'd get some work that would keep us both afloat,’ Pemberton continued.<br> <br> ‘So would I. Why shouldn't I work? I ain't such a beastly little muff as that comes to.’<br> <br> ‘The difficulty is that your parents wouldn't hear of it. They'd never part with you; they worship the ground you tread on. Don't you see the proof of it?’ Pemberton developed. ‘They don't dislike me; they wish me no harm; they're very amiable people; but they're perfectly ready to expose me to any awkwardness in life for your sake.’<br> <br> The silence in which Morgan received his fond sophistry struck Pemberton somehow as expressive. After a moment the child repeated: ‘You are a hero!’ Then he added: ‘They leave me with you altogether. You've all the responsibility. They put me off on you from morning till night. Why then should they object to my taking up with you completely? I'd help you.’<br> <br> ‘They're not particularly keen about my being helped, and they delight in thinking of you as _theirs_. They're tremendously proud of you.’<br> <br> ‘I'm not proud of _them_. But you know that,’ Morgan returned.<br> <br> ‘Except for the little matter we speak of they're charming people,’ said Pemberton, not taking up the point made for his intelligence, but wondering greatly at the boy's own, and especially at this fresh reminder of something he had been conscious of from the first--the strangest thing in his friend's large little composition, a temper, a sensibility, even a private ideal, which made him as privately disown the stuff his people were made of. Morgan had in secret a small loftiness which made him acute about betrayed meanness; as well as a critical sense for the manners immediately surrounding him that was quite without precedent in a juvenile nature, especially when one noted that it had not made this nature ‘old-fashioned,’ as the word is of children--quaint or wizened or offensive. It was as if he had been a little gentleman and had paid the penalty by discovering that he was the only such person in his family. This comparison didn't make him vain, but it could make him melancholy and a trifle austere. While Pemberton guessed at these dim young things, shadows of shadows, he was partly drawn on and partly checked, as for a scruple, by the charm of attempting to sound the little cool shallows that were so quickly growing deeper. When he tried to figure to himself the morning twilight of childhood, so as to deal with it safely, he saw it was never fixed, never arrested, that ignorance, at the instant he touched it, was already flushing faintly into knowledge, that there was nothing that at a given moment you could say an intelligent child didn't know. It seemed to him that he himself knew too much to imagine Morgan's simplicity and too little to disembroil his tangle.<br> <br> The boy paid no heed to his last remark; he only went on: ‘I'd have spoken to them about their idea, as I call it, long ago, if I hadn't been sure what they'd say.’<br> <br> ‘And what would they say?’<br> <br> ‘Just what they said about what poor Zenobie told me--that it was a horrid dreadful story, that they had paid her every penny they owed her.’<br> <br> ‘Well, perhaps they had,’ said Pemberton.<br> <br> ‘Perhaps they've paid you!’<br> <br> ‘Let us pretend they have, and n'en parlons plus.’<br> <br> ‘They accused her of lying and cheating’--Morgan stuck to historic truth. ‘That's why I don't want to speak to them.’<br> <br> ‘Lest they should accuse me, too?’ To this Morgan made no answer, and his companion, looking down at him--the boy turned away his eyes, which had filled--saw what he couldn't have trusted himself to utter. ‘You're right. Don't worry them,’ Pemberton pursued. ‘Except for that, they _are_ charming people.’<br> <br> ‘Except for _their_ lying and _their_ cheating?’<br> <br> ‘I say--I say!’ cried Pemberton, imitating a little tone of the lad's which was itself an imitation.<br> <br> ‘We must be frank, at the last; we _must_ come to an understanding,’ said Morgan with the importance of the small boy who lets himself think he is arranging great affairs--almost playing at shipwreck or at Indians. ‘I know all about everything.’<br> <br> ‘I dare say your father has his reasons,'' Pemberton replied, but too vaguely, as he was aware.<br> <br> ‘For lying and cheating?’<br> <br> ‘For saving and managing and turning his means to the best account. He has plenty to do with his money. You're an expensive family.’<br> <br> ‘Yes, I'm very expensive,’ Morgan concurred in a manner that made his preceptor burst out laughing.<br> <br> ‘He's saving for _you_,’ said Pemberton. ‘They think of you in everything they do.’<br> <br> ‘He might, while he's about it, save a little--’ The boy paused, and his friend waited to hear what. Then Morgan brought out oddly: ‘A little reputation.’<br> <br> ‘Oh there's plenty of that. That's all right!’<br> <br> ‘Enough of it for the people they know, no doubt. The people they know are awful.’<br> <br> ‘Do you mean the princes? We mustn't abuse the princes.’<br> <br> ‘Why not? They haven't married Paula--they haven't married Amy. They only clean out Ulick.’<br> <br> ‘You _do_ know everything!’ Pemberton declared.<br> <br> ‘No, I don't, after all. I don't know what they live on, or how they live, or _why_ they live! What have they got and how did they get it? Are they rich, are they poor, or have they a modeste aisance? Why are they always chiveying me about--living one year like ambassadors and the next like paupers? Who are they, any way, and what are they? I've thought of all that--I've thought of a lot of things. They're so beastly worldly. That's what I hate most--oh, I've _seen_ it! All they care about is to make an appearance and to pass for something or other. What the dickens do they want to pass for? What _do_ they, Mr. Pemberton?’<br> <br> ‘You pause for a reply,’ said Pemberton, treating the question as a joke, yet wondering too and greatly struck with his mate's intense if imperfect vision. ‘I haven't the least idea.’<br> <br> ‘And what good does it do? Haven't I seen the way people treat them--the 'nice' people, the ones they want to know? They'll take anything from them--they'll lie down and be trampled on. The nice ones hate that--they just sicken them. You're the only really nice person we know.’<br> <br> ‘Are you sure? They don't lie down for me!’<br> <br> ‘Well, you shan't lie down for them. You've got to go--that's what you've got to do,’ said Morgan.<br> <br> ‘And what will become of you?’<br> <br> ‘Oh I'm growing up. I shall get off before long. I'll see you later.’<br> <br> ‘You had better let me finish you,’ Pemberton urged, lending himself to the child's strange superiority.<br> <br> Morgan stopped in their walk, looking up at him. He had to look up much less than a couple of years before--he had grown, in his loose leanness, so long and high. ‘Finish me?’ he echoed.<br> <br> ‘There are such a lot of jolly things we can do together yet. I want to turn you out--I want you to do me credit.’<br> <br> Morgan continued to look at him. ‘To give you credit--do you mean?’<br> <br> ‘My dear fellow, you're too clever to live.’<br> <br> ‘That's just what I'm afraid you think. No, no; it isn't fair--I can't endure it. We'll separate next week. The sooner it's over the sooner to sleep.’<br> <br> ‘If I hear of anything--any other chance--I promise to go,’ Pemberton said.<br> <br> Morgan consented to consider this. ‘But you'll be honest,’ he demanded; ‘you won't pretend you haven't heard?’<br> <br> ‘I'm much more likely to pretend I have.’<br> <br> ‘But what can you hear of, this way, stuck in a hole with us? You ought to be on the spot, to go to England--you ought to go to America.’<br> <br> ‘One would think you were _my_ tutor!’ said Pemberton.<br> <br> Morgan walked on and after a little had begun again: ‘Well, now that you know I know and that we look at the facts and keep nothing back--it's much more comfortable, isn't it?’<br> <br> ‘My dear boy, it's so amusing, so interesting, that it will surely be quite impossible for me to forego such hours as these.’<br> <br> This made Morgan stop once more. ‘You _do_ keep something back. Oh you're not straight--_I_ am!’<br> <br> ‘How am I not straight?’<br> <br> ‘Oh you've got your idea!’<br> <br> ‘My idea?’<br> <br> ‘Why that I probably shan't make old--make older--bones, and that you can stick it out till I'm removed.’<br> <br> ‘You _are_ too clever to live!’ Pemberton repeated.<br> <br> ‘I call it a mean idea,’ Morgan pursued. ‘But I shall punish you by the way I hang on.’<br> <br> ‘Look out or I'll poison you!’ Pemberton laughed.<br> <br> ‘I'm stronger and better every year. Haven't you noticed that there hasn't been a doctor near me since you came?’<br> <br> ‘_I'm_ your doctor,’ said the young man, taking his arm and drawing him tenderly on again.<br> <br> Morgan proceeded and after a few steps gave a sigh of mingled weariness and relief. ‘Ah now that we look at the facts it's all right!’<br> <br>CHAPTER VII<br> <br> They looked at the facts a good deal after this and one of the first consequences of their doing so was that Pemberton stuck it out, in his friend's parlance, for the purpose. Morgan made the facts so vivid and so droll, and at the same time so bald and so ugly, that there was fascination in talking them over with him, just as there would have been heartlessness in leaving him alone with them. Now that the pair had such perceptions in common it was useless for them to pretend they didn't judge such people; but the very judgement and the exchange of perceptions created another tie. Morgan had never been so interesting as now that he himself was made plainer by the sidelight of these confidences. What came out in it most was the small fine passion of his pride. He had plenty of that, Pemberton felt--so much that one might perhaps wisely wish for it some early bruises. He would have liked his people to have a spirit and had waked up to the sense of their perpetually eating humble- pie. His mother would consume any amount, and his father would consume even more than his mother. He had a theory that Ulick had wriggled out of an ‘affair’ at Nice: there had once been a flurry at home, a regular panic, after which they all went to bed and took medicine, not to be accounted for on any other supposition. Morgan had a romantic imagination, led by poetry and history, and he would have liked those who ‘bore his name’--as he used to say to Pemberton with the humour that made his queer delicacies manly--to carry themselves with an air. But their one idea was to get in with people who didn't want them and to take snubs as it they were honourable scars. Why people didn't want them more he didn't know--that was people's own affair; after all they weren't superficially repulsive, they were a hundred times cleverer than most of the dreary grandees, the ‘poor swells’ they rushed about Europe to catch up with. ‘After all they _are_ amusing--they are!’ he used to pronounce with the wisdom of the ages. To which Pemberton always replied: ‘Amusing--the great Moreen troupe? Why they're altogether delightful; and if it weren't for the hitch that you and I (feeble performers!) make in the ensemble they'd carry everything before them.’<br> <br> What the boy couldn't get over was the fact that this particular blight seemed, in a tradition of self-respect, so undeserved and so arbitrary. No doubt people had a right to take the line they liked; but why should his people have liked the line of pushing and toadying and lying and cheating? What had their forefathers--all decent folk, so far as he knew--done to them, or what had he done to them? Who had poisoned their blood with the fifth-rate social ideal, the fixed idea of making smart acquaintances and getting into the monde chic, especially when it was foredoomed to failure and exposure? They showed so what they were after; that was what made the people they wanted not want _them_. And never a wince for dignity, never a throb of shame at looking each other in the face, never any independence or resentment or disgust. If his father or his brother would only knock some one down once or twice a year! Clever as they were they never guessed the impression they made. They were good- natured, yes--as good-natured as Jews at the doors of clothing-shops! But was that the model one wanted one's family to follow? Morgan had dim memories of an old grandfather, the maternal, in New York, whom he had been taken across the ocean at the age of five to see: a gentleman with a high neck-cloth and a good deal of pronunciation, who wore a dress-coat in the morning, which made one wonder what he wore in the evening, and had, or was supposed to have ‘property’ and something to do with the Bible Society. It couldn't have been but that he was a good type. Pemberton himself remembered Mrs. Clancy, a widowed sister of Mr. Moreen's, who was as irritating as a moral tale and had paid a fortnight's visit to the family at Nice shortly after he came to live with them. She was ‘pure and refined,’ as Amy said over the banjo, and had the air of not knowing what they meant when they talked, and of keeping something rather important back. Pemberton judged that what she kept back was an approval of many of their ways; therefore it was to be supposed that she too was of a good type, and that Mr. and Mrs. Moreen and Ulick and Paula and Amy might easily have been of a better one if they would.<br> <br> But that they wouldn't was more and more perceptible from day to day. They continued to ‘chivey,’ as Morgan called it, and in due time became aware of a variety of reasons for proceeding to Venice. They mentioned a great many of them--they were always strikingly frank and had the brightest friendly chatter, at the late foreign breakfast in especial, before the ladies had made up their faces, when they leaned their arms on the table, had something to follow the demitasse, and, in the heat of familiar discussion as to what they ‘really ought’ to do, fell inevitably into the languages in which they could tutoyer. Even Pemberton liked them then; he could endure even Ulick when he heard him give his little flat voice for the ‘sweet sea-city.’ That was what made him have a sneaking kindness for them--that they were so out of the workaday world and kept him so out of it. The summer had waned when, with cries of ecstasy, they all passed out on the balcony that overhung the Grand Canal. The sunsets then were splendid and the Dorringtons had arrived. The Dorringtons were the only reason they hadn't talked of at breakfast; but the reasons they didn't talk of at breakfast always came out in the end. The Dorringtons on the other hand came out very little; or else when they did they stayed--as was natural--for hours, during which periods Mrs. Moreen and the girls sometimes called at their hotel (to see if they had returned) as many as three times running. The gondola was for the ladies, as in Venice too there were ‘days,’ which Mrs. Moreen knew in their order an hour after she arrived. She immediately took one herself, to which the Dorringtons never came, though on a certain occasion when Pemberton and his pupil were together at St. Mark's--where, taking the best walks they had ever had and haunting a hundred churches, they spent a great deal of time--they saw the old lord turn up with Mr. Moreen and Ulick, who showed him the dim basilica as if it belonged to them. Pemberton noted how much less, among its curiosities, Lord Dorrington carried himself as a man of the world; wondering too whether, for such services, his companions took a fee from him. The autumn at any rate waned, the Dorringtons departed, and Lord Verschoyle, the eldest son, had proposed neither for Amy nor for Paula.<br> <br> One sad November day, while the wind roared round the old palace and the rain lashed the lagoon, Pemberton, for exercise and even somewhat for warmth--the Moreens were horribly frugal about fires; it was a cause of suffering to their inmate--walked up and down the big bare sala with his pupil. The scagliola floor was cold, the high battered casements shook in the storm, and the stately decay of the place was unrelieved by a particle of furniture. Pemberton's spirits were low, and it came over him that the fortune of the Moreens was now even lower. A blast of desolation, a portent of disgrace and disaster, seemed to draw through the comfortless hall. Mr. Moreen and Ulick were in the Piazza, looking out for something, strolling drearily, in mackintoshes, under the arcades; but still, in spite of mackintoshes, unmistakeable men of the world. Paula and Amy were in bed--it might have been thought they were staying there to keep warm. Pemberton looked askance at the boy at his side, to see to what extent he was conscious of these dark omens. But Morgan, luckily for him, was now mainly conscious of growing taller and stronger and indeed of being in his fifteenth year. This fact was intensely interesting to him and the basis of a private theory--which, however, he had imparted to his tutor--that in a little while he should stand on his own feet. He considered that the situation would change--that in short he should be ‘finished,’ grown up, producible in the world of affairs and ready to prove himself of sterling ability. Sharply as he was capable at times of analysing, as he called it, his life, there were happy hours when he remained, as he also called it--and as the name, really, of their right ideal--’jolly’ superficial; the proof of which was his fundamental assumption that he should presently go to Oxford, to Pemberton's college, and, aided and abetted by Pemberton, do the most wonderful things. It depressed the young man to see how little in such a project he took account of ways and means: in other connexions he mostly kept to the measure. Pemberton tried to imagine the Moreens at Oxford and fortunately failed; yet unless they were to adopt it as a residence there would be no modus vivendi for Morgan. How could he live without an allowance, and where was the allowance to come from? He, Pemberton, might live on Morgan; but how could Morgan live on _him_? What was to become of him anyhow? Somehow the fact that he was a big boy now, with better prospects of health, made the question of his future more difficult. So long as he was markedly frail the great consideration he inspired seemed enough of an answer to it. But at the bottom of Pemberton's heart was the recognition of his probably being strong enough to live and not yet strong enough to struggle or to thrive. Morgan himself at any rate was in the first flush of the rosiest consciousness of adolescence, so that the beating of the tempest seemed to him after all but the voice of life and the challenge of fate. He had on his shabby little overcoat, with the collar up, but was enjoying his walk.<br> <br> It was interrupted at last by the appearance of his mother at the end of the sala. She beckoned him to come to her, and while Pemberton saw him, complaisant, pass down the long vista and over the damp false marble, he wondered what was in the air. Mrs. Moreen said a word to the boy and made him go into the room she had quitted. Then, having closed the door after him, she directed her steps swiftly to Pemberton. There was something in the air, but his wildest flight of fancy wouldn't have suggested what it proved to be. She signified that she had made a pretext to get Morgan out of the way, and then she enquired--without hesitation--if the young man could favour her with the loan of three louis. While, before bursting into a laugh, he stared at her with surprise, she declared that she was awfully pressed for the money; she was desperate for it--it would save her life.<br> <br> ‘Dear lady, c'est trop fort!’ Pemberton laughed in the manner and with the borrowed grace of idiom that marked the best colloquial, the best anecdotic, moments of his friends themselves. ‘Where in the world do you suppose I should get three louis, du train dont vous allez?’<br> <br> ‘I thought you worked--wrote things. Don't they pay you?’<br> <br> ‘Not a penny.’<br> <br> ‘Are you such a fool as to work for nothing?’<br> <br> ‘You ought surely to know that.’<br> <br> Mrs. Moreen stared, then she coloured a little. Pemberton saw she had quite forgotten the terms--if ‘terms’ they could be called--that he had ended by accepting from herself; they had burdened her memory as little as her conscience. ‘Oh yes, I see what you mean--you've been very nice about that; but why drag it in so often?’ She had been perfectly urbane with him ever since the rough scene of explanation in his room the morning he made her accept _his_ ‘terms’--the necessity of his making his case known to Morgan. She had felt no resentment after seeing there was no danger Morgan would take the matter up with her. Indeed, attributing this immunity to the good taste of his influence with the boy, she had once said to Pemberton ‘My dear fellow, it's an immense comfort you're a gentleman.’ She repeated this in substance now. ‘Of course you're a gentleman--that's a bother the less!’ Pemberton reminded her that he had not ‘dragged in’ anything that wasn't already in as much as his foot was in his shoe; and she also repeated her prayer that, somewhere and somehow, he would find her sixty francs. He took the liberty of hinting that if he could find them it wouldn't be to lend them to _her_--as to which he consciously did himself injustice, knowing that if he had them he would certainly put them at her disposal. He accused himself, at bottom and not unveraciously, of a fantastic, a demoralised sympathy with her. If misery made strange bedfellows it also made strange sympathies. It was moreover a part of the abasement of living with such people that one had to make vulgar retorts, quite out of one's own tradition of good manners. ‘Morgan, Morgan, to what pass have I come for you?’ he groaned while Mrs. Moreen floated voluminously down the sala again to liberate the boy, wailing as she went that everything was too odious.<br> <br> Before their young friend was liberated there came a thump at the door communicating with the staircase, followed by the apparition of a dripping youth who poked in his head. Pemberton recognised him as the bearer of a telegram and recognised the telegram as addressed to himself. Morgan came back as, after glancing at the signature--that of a relative in London--he was reading the words: ‘Found a jolly job for you, engagement to coach opulent youth on own terms. Come at once.’ The answer happily was paid and the messenger waited. Morgan, who had drawn near, waited too and looked hard at Pemberton; and Pemberton, after a moment, having met his look, handed him the telegram. It was really by wise looks--they knew each other so well now--that, while the telegraph- boy, in his waterproof cape, made a great puddle on the floor, the thing was settled between them. Pemberton wrote the answer with a pencil against the frescoed wall, and the messenger departed. When he had gone the young man explained himself.<br> <br> ‘I'll make a tremendous charge; I'll earn a lot of money in a short time, and we'll live on it.’<br> <br> ‘Well, I hope the opulent youth will be a dismal dunce--he probably will--’ Morgan parenthesised--’and keep you a long time a-hammering of it in.’<br> <br> ‘Of course the longer he keeps me the more we shall have for our old age.’<br> <br> ‘But suppose _they_ don't pay you!’ Morgan awfully suggested.<br> <br> ‘Oh there are not two such--!’ But Pemberton pulled up; he had been on the point of using too invidious a term. Instead of this he said ‘Two such fatalities.’<br> <br> Morgan flushed--the tears came to his eyes. ‘Dites toujours two such rascally crews!’ Then in a different tone he added: ‘Happy opulent youth!’<br> <br> ‘Not if he's a dismal dunce.’<br> <br> ‘Oh they're happier then. But you can't have everything, can you?’ the boy smiled.<br> <br> Pemberton held him fast, hands on his shoulders--he had never loved him so. ‘What will become of you, what will you do?’ He thought of Mrs. Moreen, desperate for sixty francs.<br> <br> ‘I shall become an homme fait.’ And then as if he recognised all the bearings of Pemberton's allusion: ‘I shall get on with them better when you're not here.’<br> <br> ‘Ah don't say that--it sounds as if I set you against them!’<br> <br> ‘You do--the sight of you. It's all right; you know what I mean. I shall be beautiful. I'll take their affairs in hand; I'll marry my sisters.’<br> <br> ‘You'll marry yourself!’ joked Pemberton; as high, rather tense pleasantry would evidently be the right, or the safest, tone for their separation.<br> <br> It was, however, not purely in this strain that Morgan suddenly asked: ‘But I say--how will you get to your jolly job? You'll have to telegraph to the opulent youth for money to come on.’<br> <br> Pemberton bethought himself. ‘They won't like that, will they?’<br> <br> ‘Oh look out for them!’<br> <br> Then Pemberton brought out his remedy. ‘I'll go to the American Consul; I'll borrow some money of him--just for the few days, on the strength of the telegram.’<br> <br> Morgan was hilarious. ‘Show him the telegram--then collar the money and stay!’<br> <br> Pemberton entered into the joke sufficiently to reply that for Morgan he was really capable of that; but the boy, growing more serious, and to prove he hadn't meant what he said, not only hurried him off to the Consulate--since he was to start that evening, as he had wired to his friend--but made sure of their affair by going with him. They splashed through the tortuous perforations and over the humpbacked bridges, and they passed through the Piazza, where they saw Mr. Moreen and Ulick go into a jeweller's shop. The Consul proved accommodating--Pemberton said it wasn't the letter, but Morgan's grand air--and on their way back they went into Saint Mark's for a hushed ten minutes. Later they took up and kept up the fun of it to the very end; and it seemed to Pemberton a part of that fun that Mrs. Moreen, who was very angry when he had announced her his intention, should charge him, grotesquely and vulgarly and in reference to the loan she had vainly endeavoured to effect, with bolting lest they should ‘get something out’ of him. On the other hand he had to do Mr. Moreen and Ulick the justice to recognise that when on coming in they heard the cruel news they took it like perfect men of the world.<br> <br>CHAPTER VIII<br> <br> When he got at work with the opulent youth, who was to be taken in hand for Balliol, he found himself unable to say if this aspirant had really such poor parts or if the appearance were only begotten of his own long association with an intensely living little mind. From Morgan he heard half a dozen times: the boy wrote charming young letters, a patchwork of tongues, with indulgent postscripts in the family Volapuk and, in little squares and rounds and crannies of the text, the drollest illustrations--letters that he was divided between the impulse to show his present charge as a vain, a wasted incentive, and the sense of something in them that publicity would profane. The opulent youth went up in due course and failed to pass; but it seemed to add to the presumption that brilliancy was not expected of him all at once that his parents, condoning the lapse, which they good-naturedly treated as little as possible as if it were Pemberton's, should have sounded the rally again, begged the young coach to renew the siege.<br> <br> The young coach was now in a position to lend Mrs. Moreen three louis, and he sent her a post-office order even for a larger amount. In return for this favour he received a frantic scribbled line from her: ‘Implore you to come back instantly--Morgan dread fully ill.’ They were on there rebound, once more in Paris--often as Pemberton had seen them depressed he had never seen them crushed--and communication was therefore rapid. He wrote to the boy to ascertain the state of his health, but awaited the answer in vain. He accordingly, after three days, took an abrupt leave of the opulent youth and, crossing the Channel, alighted at the small hotel, in the quarter of the Champs Elysees, of which Mrs. Moreen had given him the address. A deep if dumb dissatisfaction with this lady and her companions bore him company: they couldn't be vulgarly honest, but they could live at hotels, in velvety entresols, amid a smell of burnt pastilles, surrounded by the most expensive city in Europe. When he had left them in Venice it was with an irrepressible suspicion that something was going to happen; but the only thing that could have taken place was again their masterly retreat. ‘How is he? where is he?’ he asked of Mrs. Moreen; but before she could speak these questions were answered by the pressure round hid neck of a pair of arms, in shrunken sleeves, which still were perfectly capable of an effusive young foreign squeeze.<br> <br> ‘Dreadfully ill--I don't see it!’ the young man cried. And then to Morgan: ‘Why on earth didn't you relieve me? Why didn't you answer my letter?’<br> <br> Mrs. Moreen declared that when she wrote he was very bad, and Pemberton learned at the same time from the boy that he had answered every letter he had received. This led to the clear inference that Pemberton's note had been kept from him so that the game practised should not be interfered with. Mrs. Moreen was prepared to see the fact exposed, as Pemberton saw the moment he faced her that she was prepared for a good many other things. She was prepared above all to maintain that she had acted from a sense of duty, that she was enchanted she had got him over, whatever they might say, and that it was useless of him to pretend he didn't know in all his bones that his place at such a time was with Morgan. He had taken the boy away from them and now had no right to abandon him. He had created for himself the gravest responsibilities and must at least abide by what he had done.<br> <br> ‘Taken him away from you?’ Pemberton exclaimed indignantly.<br> <br> ‘Do it--do it for pity's sake; that's just what I want. I can't stand _this_--and such scenes. They're awful frauds--poor dears!’ These words broke from Morgan, who had intermitted his embrace, in a key which made Pemberton turn quickly to him and see that he had suddenly seated himself, was breathing in great pain, and was very pale.<br> <br> ‘_Now_ do you say he's not in a state, my precious pet?’ shouted his mother, dropping on her knees before him with clasped hands, but touching him no more than if he had been a gilded idol. ‘It will pass--it's only for an instant; but don't say such dreadful things!’<br> <br> ‘I'm all right--all right,’ Morgan panted to Pemberton, whom he sat looking up at with a strange smile, his hands resting on either side of the sofa.<br> <br> ‘Now do you pretend I've been dishonest, that I've deceived?’ Mrs. Moreen flashed at Pemberton as she got up.<br> <br> ‘It isn't _he_ says it, it's I!’ the boy returned, apparently easier, but sinking back against the wall; while his restored friend, who had sat down beside him, took his hand and bent over him.<br> <br> ‘Darling child, one does what one can; there are so many things to consider,’ urged Mrs. Moreen. ‘It's his _place_--his only place. You see _you_ think it is now.’<br> <br> ‘Take me away--take me away,’ Morgan went on, smiling to Pemberton with his white face.<br> <br> ‘Where shall I take you, and how--oh _how_, my boy?’ the young man stammered, thinking of the rude way in which his friends in London held that, for his convenience, with no assurance of prompt return, he had thrown them over; of the just resentment with which they would already have called in a successor, and of the scant help to finding fresh employment that resided for him in the grossness of his having failed to pass his pupil.<br> <br> ‘Oh we'll settle that. You used to talk about it,’ said Morgan. ‘If we can only go all the rest's a detail.’<br> <br> ‘Talk about it as much as you like, but don't think you can attempt it. Mr. Moreen would never consent--it would be so _very_ hand-to-mouth,’ Pemberton's hostess beautifully explained to him. Then to Morgan she made it clearer: ‘It would destroy our peace, it would break our hearts. Now that he's back it will be all the same again. You'll have your life, your work and your freedom, and we'll all be happy as we used to be. You'll bloom and grow perfectly well, and we won't have any more silly experiments, will we? They're too absurd. It's Mr. Pemberton's place--every one in his place. You in yours, your papa in his, me in mine--n'est-ce pas, cheri? We'll all forget how foolish we've been and have lovely times.’<br> <br> She continued to talk and to surge vaguely about the little draped stuffy salon while Pemberton sat with the boy, whose colour gradually came back; and she mixed up her reasons, hinting that there were going to be changes, that the other children might scatter (who knew?--Paula had her ideas) and that then it might be fancied how much the poor old parent- birds would want the little nestling. Morgan looked at Pemberton, who wouldn't let him move; and Pemberton knew exactly how he felt at hearing himself called a little nestling. He admitted that he had had one or two bad days, but he protested afresh against the wrong of his mother's having made them the ground of an appeal to poor Pemberton. Poor Pemberton could laugh now, apart from the comicality of Mrs. Moreen's mustering so much philosophy for her defence--she seemed to shake it out of her agitated petticoats, which knocked over the light gilt chairs--so little did their young companion, _marked_, unmistakeably marked at the best, strike him as qualified to repudiate any advantage.<br> <br> He himself was in for it at any rate. He should have Morgan on his hands again indefinitely; though indeed he saw the lad had a private theory to produce which would be intended to smooth this down. He was obliged to him for it in advance; but the suggested amendment didn't keep his heart rather from sinking, any more than it prevented him from accepting the prospect on the spot, with some confidence moreover that he should do so even better if he could have a little supper. Mrs. Moreen threw out more hints about the changes that were to be looked for, but she was such a mixture of smiles and shudders--she confessed she was very nervous--that he couldn't tell if she were in high feather or only in hysterics. If the family was really at last going to pieces why shouldn't she recognise the necessity of pitching Morgan into some sort of lifeboat? This presumption was fostered by the fact that they were established in luxurious quarters in the capital of pleasure; that was exactly where they naturally _would_ be established in view of going to pieces. Moreover didn't she mention that Mr. Moreen and the others were enjoying themselves at the opera with Mr. Granger, and wasn't _that_ also precisely where one would look for them on the eve of a smash? Pemberton gathered that Mr. Granger was a rich vacant American--a big bill with a flourishy heading and no items; so that one of Paula's ‘ideas’ was probably that this time she hadn't missed fire--by which straight shot indeed she would have shattered the general cohesion. And if the cohesion was to crumble what would become of poor Pemberton? He felt quite enough bound up with them to figure to his alarm as a dislodged block in the edifice.<br> <br> It was Morgan who eventually asked if no supper had been ordered for him; sitting with him below, later, at the dim delayed meal, in the presence of a great deal of corded green plush, a plate of ornamental biscuit and an aloofness marked on the part of the waiter. Mrs. Moreen had explained that they had been obliged to secure a room for the visitor out of the house; and Morgan's consolation--he offered it while Pemberton reflected on the nastiness of lukewarm sauces--proved to be, largely, that his circumstance would facilitate their escape. He talked of their escape--recurring to it often afterwards--as if they were making up a ‘boy's book’ together. But he likewise expressed his sense that there was something in the air, that the Moreens couldn't keep it up much longer. In point of fact, as Pemberton was to see, they kept it up for five or six months. All the while, however, Morgan's contention was designed to cheer him. Mr. Moreen and Ulick, whom he had met the day after his return, accepted that return like perfect men of the world. If Paula and Amy treated it even with less formality an allowance was to be made for them, inasmuch as Mr. Granger hadn't come to the opera after all. He had only placed his box at their service, with a bouquet for each of the party; there was even one apiece, embittering the thought of his profusion, for Mr. Moreen and Ulick. ‘They're all like that,’ was Morgan's comment; ‘at the very last, just when we think we've landed them they're back in the deep sea!’<br> <br> Morgan's comments in these days were more and more free; they even included a large recognition of the extraordinary tenderness with which he had been treated while Pemberton was away. Oh yes, they couldn't do enough to be nice to him, to show him they had him on their mind and make up for his loss. That was just what made the whole thing so sad and caused him to rejoice after all in Pemberton's return--he had to keep thinking of their affection less, had less sense of obligation. Pemberton laughed out at this last reason, and Morgan blushed and said: ‘Well, dash it, you know what I mean.’ Pemberton knew perfectly what he meant; but there were a good many things that--dash it too!--it didn't make any clearer. This episode of his second sojourn in Paris stretched itself out wearily, with their resumed readings and wanderings and maunderings, their potterings on the quays, their hauntings of the museums, their occasional lingerings in the Palais Royal when the first sharp weather came on and there was a comfort in warm emanations, before Chevet's wonderful succulent window. Morgan wanted to hear all about the opulent youth--he took an immense interest in him. Some of the details of his opulence--Pemberton could spare him none of them--evidently fed the boy's appreciation of all his friend had given up to come back to him; but in addition to the greater reciprocity established by that heroism he had always his little brooding theory, in which there was a frivolous gaiety too, that their long probation was drawing to a close. Morgan's conviction that the Moreens couldn't go on much longer kept pace with the unexpended impetus with which, from month to month, they did go on. Three weeks after Pemberton had rejoined them they went on to another hotel, a dingier one than the first; but Morgan rejoiced that his tutor had at least still not sacrificed the advantage of a room outside. He clung to the romantic utility of this when the day, or rather the night, should arrive for their escape.<br> <br> For the first time, in this complicated connexion, our friend felt his collar gall him. It was, as he had said to Mrs. Moreen in Venice, trop fort--everything was trop fort. He could neither really throw off his blighting burden nor find in it the benefit of a pacified conscience or of a rewarded affection. He had spent all the money accruing to him in England, and he saw his youth going and that he was getting nothing back for it. It was all very well of Morgan to count it for reparation that he should now settle on him permanently--there was an irritating flaw in such a view. He saw what the boy had in his mind; the conception that as his friend had had the generosity to come back he must show his gratitude by giving him his life. But the poor friend didn't desire the gift--what could he do with Morgan's dreadful little life? Of course at the same time that Pemberton was irritated he remembered the reason, which was very honourable to Morgan and which dwelt simply in his making one so forget that he was no more than a patched urchin. If one dealt with him on a different basis one's misadventures were one's own fault. So Pemberton waited in a queer confusion of yearning and alarm for the catastrophe which was held to hang over the house of Moreen, of which he certainly at moments felt the symptoms brush his cheek and as to which he wondered much in what form it would find its liveliest effect.<br> <br> Perhaps it would take the form of sudden dispersal--a frightened sauve qui peut, a scuttling into selfish corners. Certainly they were less elastic than of yore; they were evidently looking for something they didn't find. The Dorringtons hadn't re-appeared, the princes had scattered; wasn't that the beginning of the end? Mrs. Moreen had lost her reckoning of the famous ‘days’; her social calendar was blurred--it had turned its face to the wall. Pemberton suspected that the great, the cruel discomfiture had been the unspeakable behaviour of Mr. Granger, who seemed not to know what he wanted, or, what was much worse, what they wanted. He kept sending flowers, as if to bestrew the path of his retreat, which was never the path of a return. Flowers were all very well, but--Pemberton could complete the proposition. It was now positively conspicuous that in the long run the Moreens were a social failure; so that the young man was almost grateful the run had not been short. Mr. Moreen indeed was still occasionally able to get away on business and, what was more surprising, was likewise able to get back. Ulick had no club but you couldn't have discovered it from his appearance, which was as much as ever that of a person looking at life from the window of such an institution; therefore Pemberton was doubly surprised at an answer he once heard him make his mother in the desperate tone of a man familiar with the worst privations. Her question Pemberton had not quite caught; it appeared to be an appeal for a suggestion as to whom they might get to take Amy. ‘Let the Devil take her!’ Ulick snapped; so that Pemberton could see that they had not only lost their amiability but had ceased to believe in themselves. He could also see that if Mrs. Moreen was trying to get people to take her children she might be regarded as closing the hatches for the storm. But Morgan would be the last she would part with.<br> <br> One winter afternoon--it was a Sunday--he and the boy walked far together in the Bois de Boulogne. The evening was so splendid, the cold lemon- coloured sunset so clear, the stream of carriages and pedestrians so amusing and the fascination of Paris so great, that they stayed out later than usual and became aware that they should have to hurry home to arrive in time for dinner. They hurried accordingly, arm-in-arm, good-humoured and hungry, agreeing that there was nothing like Paris after all and that after everything too that had come and gone they were not yet sated with innocent pleasures. When they reached the hotel they found that, though scandalously late, they were in time for all the dinner they were likely to sit down to. Confusion reigned in the apartments of the Moreens--very shabby ones this time, but the best in the house--and before the interrupted service of the table, with objects displaced almost as if there had been a scuffle and a great wine-stain from an overturned bottle, Pemberton couldn't blink the fact that there had been a scene of the last proprietary firmness. The storm had come--they were all seeking refuge. The hatches were down, Paula and Amy were invisible--they had never tried the most casual art upon Pemberton, but he felt they had enough of an eye to him not to wish to meet him as young ladies whose frocks had been confiscated--and Ulick appeared to have jumped overboard. The host and his staff, in a word, had ceased to ‘go on’ at the pace of their guests, and the air of embarrassed detention, thanks to a pile of gaping trunks in the passage, was strangely commingled with the air of indignant withdrawal. When Morgan took all this in--and he took it in very quickly--he coloured to the roots of his hair. He had walked from his infancy among difficulties and dangers, but he had never seen a public exposure. Pemberton noticed in a second glance at him that the tears had rushed into his eyes and that they were tears of a new and untasted bitterness. He wondered an instant, for the boy's sake, whether he might successfully pretend not to understand. Not successfully, he felt, as Mr. and Mrs. Moreen, dinnerless by their extinguished hearth, rose before him in their little dishonoured salon, casting about with glassy eyes for the nearest port in such a storm. They were not prostrate but were horribly white, and Mrs. Moreen had evidently been crying. Pemberton quickly learned however that her grief was not for the loss of her dinner, much as she usually enjoyed it, but the fruit of a blow that struck even deeper, as she made all haste to explain. He would see for himself, so far as that went, how the great change had come, the dreadful bolt had fallen, and how they would now all have to turn themselves about. Therefore cruel as it was to them to part with their darling she must look to him to carry a little further the influence he had so fortunately acquired with the boy--to induce his young charge to follow him into some modest retreat. They depended on him--that was the fact--to take their delightful child temporarily under his protection; it would leave Mr. Moreen and herself so much more free to give the proper attention (too little, alas! had been given) to the readjustment of their affairs.<br> <br> ‘We trust you--we feel we _can_,’ said Mrs. Moreen, slowly rubbing her plump white hands and looking with compunction hard at Morgan, whose chin, not to take liberties, her husband stroked with a paternal forefinger.<br> <br> ‘Oh yes--we feel that we _can_. We trust Mr. Pemberton fully, Morgan,’ Mr. Moreen pursued.<br> <br> Pemberton wondered again if he might pretend not to understand; but everything good gave way to the intensity of Morgan's understanding. ‘Do you mean he may take me to live with him for ever and ever?’ cried the boy. ‘May take me away, away, anywhere he likes?’<br> <br> ‘For ever and ever? Comme vous-y-allez!’ Mr. Moreen laughed indulgently. ‘For as long as Mr. Pemberton may be so good.’<br> <br> ‘We've struggled, we've suffered,’ his wife went on; ‘but you've made him so your own that we've already been through the worst of the sacrifice.’<br> <br> Morgan had turned away from his father--he stood looking at Pemberton with a light in his face. His sense of shame for their common humiliated state had dropped; the case had another side--the thing was to clutch at _that_. He had a moment of boyish joy, scarcely mitigated by the reflexion that with this unexpected consecration of his hope--too sudden and too violent; the turn taken was away from a _good_ boy's book--the ‘escape’ was left on their hands. The boyish joy was there an instant, and Pemberton was almost scared at the rush of gratitude and affection that broke through his first abasement. When he stammered ‘My dear fellow, what do you say to _that_?’ how could one not say something enthusiastic? But there was more need for courage at something else that immediately followed and that made the lad sit down quietly on the nearest chair. He had turned quite livid and had raised his hand to his left side. They were all three looking at him, but Mrs. Moreen suddenly bounded forward. ‘Ah his darling little heart!’ she broke out; and this time, on her knees before him and without respect for the idol, she caught him ardently in her arms. ‘You walked him too far, you hurried him too fast!’ she hurled over her shoulder at Pemberton. Her son made no protest, and the next instant, still holding him, she sprang up with her face convulsed and with the terrified cry ‘Help, help! he's going, he's gone!’ Pemberton saw with equal horror, by Morgan's own stricken face, that he was beyond their wildest recall. He pulled him half out of his mother's hands, and for a moment, while they held him together, they looked all their dismay into each other's eyes, ‘He couldn't stand it with his weak organ,’ said Pemberton--’the shock, the whole scene, the violent emotion.’<br> <br> ‘But I thought he _wanted_ to go to you!’, wailed Mrs. Moreen.<br> <br> ‘I _told_ you he didn't, my dear,’ her husband made answer. Mr. Moreen was trembling all over and was in his way as deeply affected as his wife. But after the very first he took his bereavement as a man of the world.</p><br>CHAPTER I<br> What determined the speech that startled him in the course of their encounter scarcely matters, being probably but some words spoken by himself quite without intention--spoken as they lingered and slowly moved together after their renewal of acquaintance. He had been conveyed by friends an hour or two before to the house at which she was staying; the party of visitors at the other house, of whom he was one, and thanks to whom it was his theory, as always, that he was lost in the crowd, had been invited over to luncheon. There had been after luncheon much dispersal, all in the interest of the original motive, a view of Weatherend itself and the fine things, intrinsic features, pictures, heirlooms, treasures of all the arts, that made the place almost famous; and the great rooms were so numerous that guests could wander at their will, hang back from the principal group and in cases where they took such matters with the last seriousness give themselves up to mysterious appreciations and measurements. There were persons to be observed, singly or in couples, bending toward objects in out-of-the-way corners with their hands on their knees and their heads nodding quite as with the emphasis of an excited sense of smell. When they were two they either mingled their sounds of ecstasy or melted into silences of even deeper import, so that there were aspects of the occasion that gave it for Marcher much the air of the ‘look round,’ previous to a sale highly advertised, that excites or quenches, as may be, the dream of acquisition. The dream of acquisition at Weatherend would have had to be wild indeed, and John Marcher found himself, among such suggestions, disconcerted almost equally by the presence of those who knew too much and by that of those who knew nothing. The great rooms caused so much poetry and history to press upon him that he needed some straying apart to feel in a proper relation with them, though this impulse was not, as happened, like the gloating of some of his companions, to be compared to the movements of a dog sniffing a cupboard. It had an issue promptly enough in a direction that was not to have been calculated.<br> <br> It led, briefly, in the course of the October afternoon, to his closer meeting with May Bartram, whose face, a reminder, yet not quite a remembrance, as they sat much separated at a very long table, had begun merely by troubling him rather pleasantly. It affected him as the sequel of something of which he had lost the beginning. He knew it, and for the time quite welcomed it, as a continuation, but didn't know what it continued, which was an interest or an amusement the greater as he was also somehow aware-- yet without a direct sign from her--that the young woman herself hadn't lost the thread. She hadn't lost it, but she wouldn't give it back to him, he saw, without some putting forth of his hand for it; and he not only saw that, but saw several things more, things odd enough in the light of the fact that at the moment some accident of grouping brought them face to face he was still merely fumbling with the idea that any contact between them in the past would have had no importance. If it had had no importance he scarcely knew why his actual impression of her should so seem to have so much; the answer to which, however, was that in such a life as they all appeared to be leading for the moment one could but take things as they came. He was satisfied, without in the least being able to say why, that this young lady might roughly have ranked in the house as a poor relation; satisfied also that she was not there on a brief visit, but was more or less a part of the establishment--almost a working, a remunerated part. Didn't she enjoy at periods a protection that she paid for by helping, among other services, to show the place and explain it, deal with the tiresome people, answer questions about the dates of the building, the styles of the furniture, the authorship of the pictures, the favourite haunts of the ghost? It wasn't that she looked as if you could have given her shillings--it was impossible to look less so. Yet when she finally drifted toward him, distinctly handsome, though ever so much older--older than when he had seen her before-- it might have been as an effect of her guessing that he had, within the couple of hours, devoted more imagination to her than to all the others put together, and had thereby penetrated to a kind of truth that the others were too stupid for. She WAS there on harder terms than any one; she was there as a consequence of things suffered, one way and another, in the interval of years; and she remembered him very much as she was remembered--only a good deal better.<br> <br> By the time they at last thus came to speech they were alone in one of the rooms--remarkable for a fine portrait over the chimney- place--out of which their friends had passed, and the charm of it was that even before they had spoken they had practically arranged with each other to stay behind for talk. The charm, happily, was in other things too--partly in there being scarce a spot at Weatherend without something to stay behind for. It was in the way the autumn day looked into the high windows as it waned; the way the red light, breaking at the close from under a low sombre sky, reached out in a long shaft and played over old wainscots, old tapestry, old gold, old colour. It was most of all perhaps in the way she came to him as if, since she had been turned on to deal with the simpler sort, he might, should he choose to keep the whole thing down, just take her mild attention for a part of her general business. As soon as he heard her voice, however, the gap was filled up and the missing link supplied; the slight irony he divined in her attitude lost its advantage. He almost jumped at it to get there before her. ‘I met you years and years ago in Rome. I remember all about it.’ She confessed to disappointment--she had been so sure he didn't; and to prove how well he did he began to pour forth the particular recollections that popped up as he called for them. Her face and her voice, all at his service now, worked the miracle--the impression operating like the torch of a lamplighter who touches into flame, one by one, a long row of gas- jets. Marcher flattered himself the illumination was brilliant, yet he was really still more pleased on her showing him, with amusement, that in his haste to make everything right he had got most things rather wrong. It hadn't been at Rome--it had been at Naples; and it hadn't been eight years before--it had been more nearly ten. She hadn't been, either, with her uncle and aunt, but with her mother and brother; in addition to which it was not with the Pembles HE had been, but with the Boyers, coming down in their company from Rome--a point on which she insisted, a little to his confusion, and as to which she had her evidence in hand. The Boyers she had known, but didn't know the Pembles, though she had heard of them, and it was the people he was with who had made them acquainted. The incident of the thunderstorm that had raged round them with such violence as to drive them for refuge into an excavation--this incident had not occurred at the Palace of the Caesars, but at Pompeii, on an occasion when they had been present there at an important find.<br> <br> He accepted her amendments, he enjoyed her corrections, though the moral of them was, she pointed out, that he REALLY didn't remember the least thing about her; and he only felt it as a drawback that when all was made strictly historic there didn't appear much of anything left. They lingered together still, she neglecting her office--for from the moment he was so clever she had no proper right to him--and both neglecting the house, just waiting as to see if a memory or two more wouldn't again breathe on them. It hadn't taken them many minutes, after all, to put down on the table, like the cards of a pack, those that constituted their respective hands; only what came out was that the pack was unfortunately not perfect- -that the past, invoked, invited, encouraged, could give them, naturally, no more than it had. It had made them anciently meet-- her at twenty, him at twenty-five; but nothing was so strange, they seemed to say to each other, as that, while so occupied, it hadn't done a little more for them. They looked at each other as with the feeling of an occasion missed; the present would have been so much better if the other, in the far distance, in the foreign land, hadn't been so stupidly meagre. There weren't, apparently, all counted, more than a dozen little old things that had succeeded in coming to pass between them; trivialities of youth, simplicities of freshness, stupidities of ignorance, small possible germs, but too deeply buried--too deeply (didn't it seem?) to sprout after so many years. Marcher could only feel he ought to have rendered her some service--saved her from a capsized boat in the bay or at least recovered her dressing-bag, filched from her cab in the streets of Naples by a lazzarone with a stiletto. Or it would have been nice if he could have been taken with fever all alone at his hotel, and she could have come to look after him, to write to his people, to drive him out in convalescence. THEN they would be in possession of the something or other that their actual show seemed to lack. It yet somehow presented itself, this show, as too good to be spoiled; so that they were reduced for a few minutes more to wondering a little helplessly why--since they seemed to know a certain number of the same people--their reunion had been so long averted. They didn't use that name for it, but their delay from minute to minute to join the others was a kind of confession that they didn't quite want it to be a failure. Their attempted supposition of reasons for their not having met but showed how little they knew of each other. There came in fact a moment when Marcher felt a positive pang. It was vain to pretend she was an old friend, for all the communities were wanting, in spite of which it was as an old friend that he saw she would have suited him. He had new ones enough--was surrounded with them for instance on the stage of the other house; as a new one he probably wouldn't have so much as noticed her. He would have liked to invent something, get her to make-believe with him that some passage of a romantic or critical kind HAD originally occurred. He was really almost reaching out in imagination--as against time--for something that would do, and saying to himself that if it didn't come this sketch of a fresh start would show for quite awkwardly bungled. They would separate, and now for no second or no third chance. They would have tried and not succeeded. Then it was, just at the turn, as he afterwards made it out to himself, that, everything else failing, she herself decided to take up the case and, as it were, save the situation. He felt as soon as she spoke that she had been consciously keeping back what she said and hoping to get on without it; a scruple in her that immensely touched him when, by the end of three or four minutes more, he was able to measure it. What she brought out, at any rate, quite cleared the air and supplied the link--the link it was so odd he should frivolously have managed to lose.<br> <br> ‘You know you told me something I've never forgotten and that again and again has made me think of you since; it was that tremendously hot day when we went to Sorrento, across the bay, for the breeze. What I allude to was what you said to me, on the way back, as we sat under the awning of the boat enjoying the cool. Have you forgotten?’<br> <br> He had forgotten, and was even more surprised than ashamed. But the great thing was that he saw in this no vulgar reminder of any ‘sweet’ speech. The vanity of women had long memories, but she was making no claim on him of a compliment or a mistake. With another woman, a totally different one, he might have feared the recall possibly even some imbecile ‘offer.’ So, in having to say that he had indeed forgotten, he was conscious rather of a loss than of a gain; he already saw an interest in the matter of her mention. ‘I try to think--but I give it up. Yet I remember the Sorrento day.’<br> <br> ‘I'm not very sure you do,’ May Bartram after a moment said; ‘and I'm not very sure I ought to want you to. It's dreadful to bring a person back at any time to what he was ten years before. If you've lived away from it,’ she smiled, ‘so much the better.’<br> <br> ‘Ah if YOU haven't why should I?’ he asked.<br> <br> ‘Lived away, you mean, from what I myself was?’<br> <br> ‘From what I was. I was of course an ass,’ Marcher went on; ‘but I would rather know from you just the sort of ass I was than--from the moment you have something in your mind--not know anything.’<br> <br> Still, however, she hesitated. ‘But if you've completely ceased to be that sort--?’<br> <br> ‘Why I can then all the more bear to know. Besides, perhaps I haven't.’<br> <br> ‘Perhaps. Yet if you haven't,’ she added, ‘I should suppose you'd remember. Not indeed that I in the least connect with my impression the invidious name you use. If I had only thought you foolish,’ she explained, ‘the thing I speak of wouldn't so have remained with me. It was about yourself.’ She waited as if it might come to him; but as, only meeting her eyes in wonder, he gave no sign, she burnt her ships. ‘Has it ever happened?’<br> <br> Then it was that, while he continued to stare, a light broke for him and the blood slowly came to his face, which began to burn with recognition.<br> <br> ‘Do you mean I told you--?’ But he faltered, lest what came to him shouldn't be right, lest he should only give himself away.<br> <br> ‘It was something about yourself that it was natural one shouldn't forget--that is if one remembered you at all. That's why I ask you,’ she smiled, ‘if the thing you then spoke of has ever come to pass?’<br> <br> Oh then he saw, but he was lost in wonder and found himself embarrassed. This, he also saw, made her sorry for him, as if her allusion had been a mistake. It took him but a moment, however, to feel it hadn't been, much as it had been a surprise. After the first little shock of it her knowledge on the contrary began, even if rather strangely, to taste sweet to him. She was the only other person in the world then who would have it, and she had had it all these years, while the fact of his having so breathed his secret had unaccountably faded from him. No wonder they couldn't have met as if nothing had happened. ‘I judge,’ he finally said, ‘that I know what you mean. Only I had strangely enough lost any sense of having taken you so far into my confidence.’<br> <br> ‘Is it because you've taken so many others as well?’<br> <br> ‘I've taken nobody. Not a creature since then.’<br> <br> ‘So that I'm the only person who knows?’<br> <br> ‘The only person in the world.’<br> <br> ‘Well,’ she quickly replied, ‘I myself have never spoken. I've never, never repeated of you what you told me.’ She looked at him so that he perfectly believed her. Their eyes met over it in such a way that he was without a doubt. ‘And I never will.’<br> <br> She spoke with an earnestness that, as if almost excessive, put him at ease about her possible derision. Somehow the whole question was a new luxury to him--that is from the moment she was in possession. If she didn't take the sarcastic view she clearly took the sympathetic, and that was what he had had, in all the long time, from no one whomsoever. What he felt was that he couldn't at present have begun to tell her, and yet could profit perhaps exquisitely by the accident of having done so of old. ‘Please don't then. We're just right as it is.’<br> <br> ‘Oh I am,’ she laughed, ‘if you are!’ To which she added: ‘Then you do still feel in the same way?’<br> <br> It was impossible he shouldn't take to himself that she was really interested, though it all kept coining as a perfect surprise. He had thought of himself so long as abominably alone, and lo he wasn't alone a bit. He hadn't been, it appeared, for an hour-- since those moments on the Sorrento boat. It was she who had been, he seemed to see as he looked at her--she who had been made so by the graceless fact of his lapse of fidelity. To tell her what he had told her--what had it been but to ask something of her? something that she had given, in her charity, without his having, by a remembrance, by a return of the spirit, failing another encounter, so much as thanked her. What he had asked of her had been simply at first not to laugh at him. She had beautifully not done so for ten years, and she was not doing so now. So he had endless gratitude to make up. Only for that he must see just how he had figured to her. ‘What, exactly, was the account I gave--?’<br> <br> ‘Of the way you did feel? Well, it was very simple. You said you had had from your earliest time, as the deepest thing within you, the sense of being kept for something rare and strange, possibly prodigious and terrible, that was sooner or later to happen to you, that you had in your bones the foreboding and the conviction of, and that would perhaps overwhelm you.’<br> <br> ‘Do you call that very simple?’ John Marcher asked.<br> <br> She thought a moment. ‘It was perhaps because I seemed, as you spoke, to understand it.’<br> <br> ‘You do understand it?’ he eagerly asked.<br> <br> Again she kept her kind eyes on him. ‘You still have the belief?’<br> <br> ‘Oh!’ he exclaimed helplessly. There was too much to say.<br> <br> ‘Whatever it's to be,’ she clearly made out, ‘it hasn't yet come.’<br> <br> He shook his head in complete surrender now. ‘It hasn't yet come. Only, you know, it isn't anything I'm to do, to achieve in the world, to be distinguished or admired for. I'm not such an ass as THAT. It would be much better, no doubt, if I were.’<br> <br> ‘It's to be something you're merely to suffer?’<br> <br> ‘Well, say to wait for--to have to meet, to face, to see suddenly break out in my life; possibly destroying all further consciousness, possibly annihilating me; possibly, on the other hand, only altering everything, striking at the root of all my world and leaving me to the consequences, however they shape themselves.’<br> <br> She took this in, but the light in her eyes continued for him not to be that of mockery. ‘Isn't what you describe perhaps but the expectation--or at any rate the sense of danger, familiar to so many people--of falling in love?’<br> <br> John Marcher thought. ‘Did you ask me that before?’<br> <br> ‘No--I wasn't so free-and-easy then. But it's what strikes me now.’<br> <br> ‘Of course,’ he said after a moment, ‘it strikes you. Of course it strikes ME. Of course what's in store for me may be no more than that. The only thing is,’ he went on, ‘that I think if it had been that I should by this time know.’<br> <br> ‘Do you mean because you've BEEN in love?’ And then as he but looked at her in silence: ‘You've been in love, and it hasn't meant such a cataclysm, hasn't proved the great affair?’<br> <br> ‘Here I am, you see. It hasn't been overwhelming.’<br> <br> ‘Then it hasn't been love,’ said May Bartram.<br> <br> ‘Well, I at least thought it was. I took it for that--I've taken it till now. It was agreeable, it was delightful, it was miserable,’ he explained. ‘But it wasn't strange. It wasn't what my affair's to be.’<br> <br> ‘You want something all to yourself--something that nobody else knows or HAS known?’<br> <br> ‘It isn't a question of what I 'want'--God knows I don't want anything. It's only a question of the apprehension that haunts me- -that I live with day by day.’<br> <br> He said this so lucidly and consistently that he could see it further impose itself. If she hadn't been interested before she'd have been interested now.<br> <br> ‘Is it a sense of coming violence?’<br> <br> Evidently now too again he liked to talk of it. ‘I don't think of it as--when it does come--necessarily violent. I only think of it as natural and as of course above all unmistakeable. I think of it simply as THE thing. THE thing will of itself appear natural.’<br> <br> ‘Then how will it appear strange?’<br> <br> Marcher bethought himself. ‘It won't--to ME.’<br> <br> ‘To whom then?’<br> <br> ‘Well,’ he replied, smiling at last, ‘say to you.’<br> <br> ‘Oh then I'm to be present?’<br> <br> ‘Why you are present--since you know.’<br> <br> ‘I see.’ She turned it over. ‘But I mean at the catastrophe.’<br> <br> At this, for a minute, their lightness gave way to their gravity; it was as if the long look they exchanged held them together. ‘It will only depend on yourself--if you'll watch with me.’<br> <br> ‘Are you afraid?’ she asked.<br> <br> ‘Don't leave me now,’ he went on.<br> <br> ‘Are you afraid?’ she repeated.<br> <br> ‘Do you think me simply out of my mind?’ he pursued instead of answering. ‘Do I merely strike you as a harmless lunatic?’<br> <br> ‘No,’ said May Bartram. ‘I understand you. I believe you.’<br> <br> ‘You mean you feel how my obsession--poor old thing--may correspond to some possible reality?’<br> <br> ‘To some possible reality.’<br> <br> ‘Then you WILL watch with me?’<br> <br> She hesitated, then for the third time put her question. ‘Are you afraid?’<br> <br> ‘Did I tell you I was--at Naples?’<br> <br> ‘No, you said nothing about it.’<br> <br> ‘Then I don't know. And I should like to know,’ said John Marcher. ‘You'll tell me yourself whether you think so. If you'll watch with me you'll see.’<br> <br> ‘Very good then.’ They had been moving by this time across the room, and at the door, before passing out, they paused as for the full wind-up of their understanding. ‘I'll watch with you,’ said May Bartram.<br> <br>CHAPTER II<br> <br> <br> <br> The fact that she ‘knew’--knew and yet neither chaffed him nor betrayed him--had in a short time begun to constitute between them a goodly bond, which became more marked when, within the year that followed their afternoon at Weatherend, the opportunities for meeting multiplied. The event that thus promoted these occasions was the death of the ancient lady her great-aunt, under whose wing, since losing her mother, she had to such an extent found shelter, and who, though but the widowed mother of the new successor to the property, had succeeded--thanks to a high tone and a high temper-- in not forfeiting the supreme position at the great house. The deposition of this personage arrived but with her death, which, followed by many changes, made in particular a difference for the young woman in whom Marcher's expert attention had recognised from the first a dependent with a pride that might ache though it didn't bristle. Nothing for a long time had made him easier than the thought that the aching must have been much soothed by Miss Bartram's now finding herself able to set up a small home in London. She had acquired property, to an amount that made that luxury just possible, under her aunt's extremely complicated will, and when the whole matter began to be straightened out, which indeed took time, she let him know that the happy issue was at last in view. He had seen her again before that day, both because she had more than once accompanied the ancient lady to town and because he had paid another visit to the friends who so conveniently made of Weatherend one of the charms of their own hospitality. These friends had taken him back there; he had achieved there again with Mss Bartram some quiet detachment; and he had in London succeeded in persuading her to more than one brief absence from her aunt. They went together, on these latter occasions, to the National Gallery and the South Kensington Museum, where, among vivid reminders, they talked of Italy at large--not now attempting to recover, as at first, the taste of their youth and their ignorance. That recovery, the first day at Weatherend, had served its purpose well, had given them quite enough; so that they were, to Marcher's sense, no longer hovering about the head-waters of their stream, but had felt their boat pushed sharply off and down the current.<br> <br> They were literally afloat together; for our gentleman this was marked, quite as marked as that the fortunate cause of it was just the buried treasure of her knowledge. He had with his own hands dug up this little hoard, brought to light--that is to within reach of the dim day constituted by their discretions and privacies--the object of value the hiding-place of which he had, after putting it into the ground himself, so strangely, so long forgotten. The rare luck of his having again just stumbled on the spot made him indifferent to any other question; he would doubtless have devoted more time to the odd accident of his lapse of memory if he hadn't been moved to devote so much to the sweetness, the comfort, as he felt, for the future, that this accident itself had helped to keep fresh. It had never entered into his plan that any one should ‘know’, and mainly for the reason that it wasn't in him to tell any one. That would have been impossible, for nothing but the amusement of a cold world would have waited on it. Since, however, a mysterious fate had opened his mouth betimes, in spite of him, he would count that a compensation and profit by it to the utmost. That the right person SHOULD know tempered the asperity of his secret more even than his shyness had permitted him to imagine; and May Bartram was clearly right, because--well, because there she was. Her knowledge simply settled it; he would have been sure enough by this time had she been wrong. There was that in his situation, no doubt, that disposed him too much to see her as a mere confidant, taking all her light for him from the fact--the fact only--of her interest in his predicament; from her mercy, sympathy, seriousness, her consent not to regard him as the funniest of the funny. Aware, in fine, that her price for him was just in her giving him this constant sense of his being admirably spared, he was careful to remember that she had also a life of her own, with things that might happen to HER, things that in friendship one should likewise take account of. Something fairly remarkable came to pass with him, for that matter, in this connexion--something represented by a certain passage of his consciousness, in the suddenest way, from one extreme to the other.<br> <br> He had thought himself, so long as nobody knew, the most disinterested person in the world, carrying his concentrated burden, his perpetual suspense, ever so quietly, holding his tongue about it, giving others no glimpse of it nor of its effect upon his life, asking of them no allowance and only making on his side all those that were asked. He hadn't disturbed people with the queerness of their having to know a haunted man, though he had had moments of rather special temptation on hearing them say they were forsooth ‘unsettled.’ If they were as unsettled as he was--he who had never been settled for an hour in his life--they would know what it meant. Yet it wasn't, all the same, for him to make them, and he listened to them civilly enough. This was why he had such good--though possibly such rather colourless--manners; this was why, above all, he could regard himself, in a greedy world, as decently--as in fact perhaps even a little sublimely--unselfish. Our point is accordingly that he valued this character quite sufficiently to measure his present danger of letting it lapse, against which he promised himself to be much on his guard. He was quite ready, none the less, to be selfish just a little, since surely no more charming occasion for it had come to him. ‘Just a little,’ in a word, was just as much as Mss Bartram, taking one day with another, would let him. He never would be in the least coercive, and would keep well before him the lines on which consideration for her--the very highest--ought to proceed. He would thoroughly establish the heads under which her affairs, her requirements, her peculiarities--he went so far as to give them the latitude of that name--would come into their intercourse. All this naturally was a sign of how much he took the intercourse itself for granted. There was nothing more to be done about that. It simply existed; had sprung into being with her first penetrating question to him in the autumn light there at Weatherend. The real form it should have taken on the basis that stood out large was the form of their marrying. But the devil in this was that the very basis itself put marrying out of the question. His conviction, his apprehension, his obsession, in short, wasn't a privilege he could invite a woman to share; and that consequence of it was precisely what was the matter with him. Something or other lay in wait for him, amid the twists and the turns of the months and the years, like a crouching Beast in the Jungle. It signified little whether the crouching Beast were destined to slay him or to be slain. The definite point was the inevitable spring of the creature; and the definite lesson from that was that a man of feeling didn't cause himself to be accompanied by a lady on a tiger-hunt. Such was the image under which he had ended by figuring his life.<br> <br> They had at first, none the less, in the scattered hours spent together, made no allusion to that view of it; which was a sign he was handsomely alert to give that he didn't expect, that he in fact didn't care, always to be talking about it. Such a feature in one's outlook was really like a hump on one's back. The difference it made every minute of the day existed quite independently of discussion. One discussed of course LIKE a hunchback, for there was always, if nothing else, the hunchback face. That remained, and she was watching him; but people watched best, as a general thing, in silence, so that such would be predominantly the manner of their vigil. Yet he didn't want, at the same time, to be tense and solemn; tense and solemn was what he imagined he too much showed for with other people. The thing to be, with the one person who knew, was easy and natural--to make the reference rather than be seeming to avoid it, to avoid it rather than be seeming to make it, and to keep it, in any case, familiar, facetious even, rather than pedantic and portentous. Some such consideration as the latter was doubtless in his mind for instance when he wrote pleasantly to Miss Bartram that perhaps the great thing he had so long felt as in the lap of the gods was no more than this circumstance, which touched him so nearly, of her acquiring a house in London. It was the first allusion they had yet again made, needing any other hitherto so little; but when she replied, after having given him the news, that she was by no means satisfied with such a trifle as the climax to so special a suspense, she almost set him wondering if she hadn't even a larger conception of singularity for him than he had for himself. He was at all events destined to become aware little by little, as time went by, that she was all the while looking at his life, judging it, measuring it, in the light of the thing she knew, which grew to be at last, with the consecration of the years, never mentioned between them save as ‘the real truth’ about him. That had always been his own form of reference to it, but she adopted the form so quietly that, looking back at the end of a period, he knew there was no moment at which it was traceable that she had, as he might say, got inside his idea, or exchanged the attitude of beautifully indulging for that of still more beautifully believing him.<br> <br> It was always open to him to accuse her of seeing him but as the most harmless of maniacs, and this, in the long run--since it covered so much ground--was his easiest description of their friendship. He had a screw loose for her but she liked him in spite of it and was practically, against the rest of the world, his kind wise keeper, unremunerated but fairly amused and, in the absence of other near ties, not disreputably occupied. The rest of the world of course thought him queer, but she, she only, knew how, and above all why, queer; which was precisely what enabled her to dispose the concealing veil in the right folds. She took his gaiety from him--since it had to pass with them for gaiety--as she took everything else; but she certainly so far justified by her unerring touch his finer sense of the degree to which he had ended by convincing her. SHE at least never spoke of the secret of his life except as ‘the real truth about you,’ and she had in fact a wonderful way of making it seem, as such, the secret of her own life too. That was in fine how he so constantly felt her as allowing for him; he couldn't on the whole call it anything else. He allowed for himself, but she, exactly, allowed still more; partly because, better placed for a sight of the matter, she traced his unhappy perversion through reaches of its course into which he could scarce follow it. He knew how he felt, but, besides knowing that, she knew how he looked as well; he knew each of the things of importance he was insidiously kept from doing, but she could add up the amount they made, understand how much, with a lighter weight on his spirit, he might have done, and thereby establish how, clever as he was, he fell short. Above all she was in the secret of the difference between the forms he went through--those of his little office under Government, those of caring for his modest patrimony, for his library, for his garden in the country, for the people in London whose invitations he accepted and repaid--and the detachment that reigned beneath them and that made of all behaviour, all that could in the least be called behaviour, a long act of dissimulation. What it had come to was that he wore a mask painted with the social simper, out of the eye-holes of which there looked eyes of an expression not in the least matching the other features. This the stupid world, even after years, had never more than half discovered. It was only May Bartram who had, and she achieved, by an art indescribable, the feat of at once--or perhaps it was only alternately--meeting the eyes from in front and mingling her own vision, as from over his shoulder, with their peep through the apertures.<br> <br> So while they grew older together she did watch with him, and so she let this association give shape and colour to her own existence. Beneath HER forms as well detachment had learned to sit, and behaviour had become for her, in the social sense, a false account of herself. There was but one account of her that would have been true all the while and that she could give straight to nobody, least of all to John Marcher. Her whole attitude was a virtual statement, but the perception of that only seemed called to take its place for him as one of the many things necessarily crowded out of his consciousness. If she had moreover, like himself, to make sacrifices to their real truth, it was to be granted that her compensation might have affected her as more prompt and more natural. They had long periods, in this London time, during which, when they were together, a stranger might have listened to them without in the least pricking up his ears; on the other hand the real truth was equally liable at any moment to rise to the surface, and the auditor would then have wondered indeed what they were talking about. They had from an early hour made up their mind that society was, luckily, unintelligent, and the margin allowed them by this had fairly become one of their commonplaces. Yet there were still moments when the situation turned almost fresh--usually under the effect of some expression drawn from herself. Her expressions doubtless repeated themselves, but her intervals were generous. ‘What saves us, you know, is that we answer so completely to so usual an appearance: that of the man and woman whose friendship has become such a daily habit--or almost--as to be at last indispensable.’ That for instance was a remark she had frequently enough had occasion to make, though she had given it at different times different developments. What we are especially concerned with is the turn it happened to take from her one afternoon when he had come to see her in honour of her birthday. This anniversary had fallen on a Sunday, at a season of thick fog and general outward gloom; but he had brought her his customary offering, having known her now long enough to have established a hundred small traditions. It was one of his proofs to himself, the present he made her on her birthday, that he hadn't sunk into real selfishness. It was mostly nothing more than a small trinket, but it was always fine of its kind, and he was regularly careful to pay for it more than he thought he could afford. ‘Our habit saves you, at least, don't you see?’ because it makes you, after all, for the vulgar, indistinguishable from other men. What's the most inveterate mark of men in general? Why the capacity to spend endless time with dull women--to spend it I won't say without being bored, but without minding that they are, without being driven off at a tangent by it; which comes to the same thing. I'm your dull woman, a part of the daily bread for which you pray at church. That covers your tracks more than anything.’<br> <br> ‘And what covers yours?’ asked Marcher, whom his dull woman could mostly to this extent amuse. ‘I see of course what you mean by your saving me, in this way and that, so far as other people are concerned--I've seen it all along. Only what is it that saves YOU? I often think, you know, of that.’<br> <br> She looked as if she sometimes thought of that too, but rather in a different way. ‘Where other people, you mean, are concerned?’<br> <br> ‘Well, you're really so in with me, you know--as a sort of result of my being so in with yourself. I mean of my having such an immense regard for you, being so tremendously mindful of all you've done for me. I sometimes ask myself if it's quite fair. Fair I mean to have so involved and--since one may say it--interested you. I almost feel as if you hadn't really had time to do anything else.’<br> <br> ‘Anything else but be interested?’ she asked. ‘Ah what else does one ever want to be? If I've been 'watching' with you, as we long ago agreed I was to do, watching's always in itself an absorption.’<br> <br> ‘Oh certainly,’ John Marcher said, ‘if you hadn't had your curiosity -! Only doesn't it sometimes come to you as time goes on that your curiosity isn't being particularly repaid?’<br> <br> May Bartram had a pause. ‘Do you ask that, by any chance, because you feel at all that yours isn't? I mean because you have to wait so long.’<br> <br> Oh he understood what she meant! ‘For the thing to happen that never does happen? For the Beast to jump out? No, I'm just where I was about it. It isn't a matter as to which I can CHOOSE, I can decide for a change. It isn't one as to which there CAN be a change. It's in the lap of the gods. One's in the hands of one's law--there one is. As to the form the law will take, the way it will operate, that's its own affair.’<br> <br> ‘Yes,’ Miss Bartram replied; ‘of course one's fate's coming, of course it HAS come in its own form and its own way, all the while. Only, you know, the form and the way in your case were to have been--well, something so exceptional and, as one may say, so particularly YOUR own.’<br> <br> Something in this made him look at her with suspicion. ‘You say 'were to HAVE been,' as if in your heart you had begun to doubt.’<br> <br> ‘Oh!’ she vaguely protested.<br> <br> ‘As if you believed,’ he went on, ‘that nothing will now take place.’<br> <br> She shook her head slowly but rather inscrutably. ‘You're far from my thought.’<br> <br> He continued to look at her. ‘What then is the matter with you?’<br> <br> ‘Well,’ she said after another wait, ‘the matter with me is simply that I'm more sure than ever my curiosity, as you call it, will be but too well repaid.’<br> <br> They were frankly grave now; he had got up from his seat, had turned once more about the little drawing-room to which, year after year, he brought his inevitable topic; in which he had, as he might have said, tasted their intimate community with every sauce, where every object was as familiar to him as the things of his own house and the very carpets were worn with his fitful walk very much as the desks in old counting-houses are worn by the elbows of generations of clerks. The generations of his nervous moods had been at work there, and the place was the written history of his whole middle life. Under the impression of what his friend had just said he knew himself, for some reason, more aware of these things; which made him, after a moment, stop again before her. ‘Is it possibly that you've grown afraid?’<br> <br> ‘Afraid?’ He thought, as she repeated the word, that his question had made her, a little, change colour; so that, lest he should have touched on a truth, he explained very kindly: ‘You remember that that was what you asked ME long ago--that first day at Weatherend.’<br> <br> ‘Oh yes, and you told me you didn't know--that I was to see for myself. We've said little about it since, even in so long a time.’<br> <br> ‘Precisely,’ Marcher interposed--’quite as if it were too delicate a matter for us to make free with. Quite as if we might find, on pressure, that I AM afraid. For then,’ he said, ‘we shouldn't, should we? quite know what to do.’<br> <br> She had for the time no answer to this question. ‘There have been days when I thought you were. Only, of course,’ she added, ‘there have been days when we have thought almost anything.’<br> <br> ‘Everything. Oh!’ Marcher softly groaned, as with a gasp, half spent, at the face, more uncovered just then than it had been for a long while, of the imagination always with them. It had always had it's incalculable moments of glaring out, quite as with the very eyes of the very Beast, and, used as he was to them, they could still draw from him the tribute of a sigh that rose from the depths of his being. All they had thought, first and last, rolled over him; the past seemed to have been reduced to mere barren speculation. This in fact was what the place had just struck him as so full of--the simplification of everything but the state of suspense. That remained only by seeming to hang in the void surrounding it. Even his original fear, if fear it as had been, had lost itself in the desert. ‘I judge, however,’ he continued, ‘that you see I'm not afraid now.’<br> <br> ‘What I see, as I make it out, is that you've achieved something almost unprecedented in the way of getting used to danger. Living with it so long and so closely you've lost your sense of it; you know it's there, but you're indifferent, and you cease even, as of old, to have to whistle in the dark. Considering what the danger is,’ May Bartram wound up, ‘I'm bound to say I don't think your attitude could well be surpassed.’<br> <br> John Marcher faintly smiled. ‘It's heroic?’<br> <br> ‘Certainly--call it that.’<br> <br> It was what he would have liked indeed to call it. ‘I AM then a man of courage?’<br> <br> ‘That's what you were to show me.’<br> <br> He still, however, wondered. ‘But doesn't the man of courage know what he's afraid of--or not afraid of? I don't know THAT, you see. I don't focus it. I can't name it. I only know I'm exposed.’<br> <br> ‘Yes, but exposed--how shall I say?--so directly. So intimately. That's surely enough.’<br> <br> ‘Enough to make you feel then--as what we may call the end and the upshot of our watch--that I'm not afraid?’<br> <br> ‘You're not afraid. But it isn't,’ she said, ‘the end of our watch. That is it isn't the end of yours. You've everything still to see.’<br> <br> ‘Then why haven't you?’ he asked. He had had, all along, to-day, the sense of her keeping something back, and he still had it. As this was his first impression of that it quite made a date. The case was the more marked as she didn't at first answer; which in turn made him go on. ‘You know something I don't.’ Then his voice, for that of a man of courage, trembled a little. ‘You know what's to happen.’ Her silence, with the face she showed, was almost a confession--it made him sure. ‘You know, and you're afraid to tell me. It's so bad that you're afraid I'll find out.’<br> <br> All this might be true, for she did look as if, unexpectedly to her, he had crossed some mystic line that she had secretly drawn round her. Yet she might, after all, not have worried; and the real climax was that he himself, at all events, needn't. ‘You'll never find out.’<br> <br>CHAPTER III<br> <br>It was all to have made, none the less, as I have said, a date; which came out in the fact that again and again, even after long intervals, other things that passed between them were in relation to this hour but the character of recalls and results. Its immediate effect had been indeed rather to lighten insistence-- almost to provoke a reaction; as if their topic had dropped by its own weight and as if moreover, for that matter, Marcher had been visited by one of his occasional warnings against egotism. He had kept up, he felt, and very decently on the whole, his consciousness of the importance of not being selfish, and it was true that he had never sinned in that direction without promptly enough trying to press the scales the other way. He often repaired his fault, the season permitting, by inviting his friend to accompany him to the opera; and it not infrequently thus happened that, to show he didn't wish her to have but one sort of food for her mind, he was the cause of her appearing there with him a dozen nights in the month. It even happened that, seeing her home at such times, he occasionally went in with her to finish, as he called it, the evening, and, the better to make his point, sat down to the frugal but always careful little supper that awaited his pleasure. His point was made, he thought, by his not eternally insisting with her on himself; made for instance, at such hours, when it befell that, her piano at hand and each of them familiar with it, they went over passages of the opera together. It chanced to be on one of these occasions, however, that he reminded her of her not having answered a certain question he had put to her during the talk that had taken place between them on her last birthday. ‘What is it that saves YOU?’--saved her, he meant, from that appearance of variation from the usual human type. If he had practically escaped remark, as she pretended, by doing, in the most important particular, what most men do--find the answer to life in patching up an alliance of a sort with a woman no better than himself--how had she escaped it, and how could the alliance, such as it was, since they must suppose it had been more or less noticed, have failed to make her rather positively talked about?<br> <br> ‘I never said,’ May Bartram replied, ‘that it hadn't made me a good deal talked about.’<br> <br> ‘Ah well then you're not 'saved.'‘<br> <br> ‘It hasn't been a question for me. If you've had your woman I've had,’ she said, ‘my man.’<br> <br> ‘And you mean that makes you all right?’<br> <br> Oh it was always as if there were so much to say!<br> <br> ‘I don't know why it shouldn't make me--humanly, which is what we're speaking of--as right as it makes you.’<br> <br> ‘I see,’ Marcher returned. ‘'Humanly,' no doubt, as showing that you're living for something. Not, that is, just for me and my secret.’<br> <br> May Bartram smiled. ‘I don't pretend it exactly shows that I'm not living for you. It's my intimacy with you that's in question.’<br> <br> He laughed as he saw what she meant. ‘Yes, but since, as you say, I'm only, so far as people make out, ordinary, you're--aren't you? no more than ordinary either. You help me to pass for a man like another. So if I AM, as I understand you, you're not compromised. Is that it?’<br> <br> She had another of her waits, but she spoke clearly enough. ‘That's it. It's all that concerns me--to help you to pass for a man like another.’<br> <br> He was careful to acknowledge the remark handsomely. ‘How kind, how beautiful, you are to me! How shall I ever repay you?’<br> <br> She had her last grave pause, as if there might be a choice of ways. But she chose. ‘By going on as you are.’<br> <br> It was into this going on as he was that they relapsed, and really for so long a time that the day inevitably came for a further sounding of their depths. These depths, constantly bridged over by a structure firm enough in spite of its lightness and of its occasional oscillation in the somewhat vertiginous air, invited on occasion, in the interest of their nerves, a dropping of the plummet and a measurement of the abyss. A difference had been made moreover, once for all, by the fact that she had all the while not appeared to feel the need of rebutting his charge of an idea within her that she didn't dare to express--a charge uttered just before one of the fullest of their later discussions ended. It had come up for him then that she ‘knew’ something and that what she knew was bad--too bad to tell him. When he had spoken of it as visibly so bad that she was afraid he might find it out, her reply had left the matter too equivocal to be let alone and yet, for Marcher's special sensibility, almost too formidable again to touch. He circled about it at a distance that alternately narrowed and widened and that still wasn't much affected by the consciousness in him that there was nothing she could ‘know,’ after all, any better than he did. She had no source of knowledge he hadn't equally-- except of course that she might have finer nerves. That was what women had where they were interested; they made out things, where people were concerned, that the people often couldn't have made out for themselves. Their nerves, their sensibility, their imagination, were conductors and revealers, and the beauty of May Bartram was in particular that she had given herself so to his case. He felt in these days what, oddly enough, he had never felt before, the growth of a dread of losing her by some catastrophe-- some catastrophe that yet wouldn't at all be the catastrophe: partly because she had almost of a sudden begun to strike him as more useful to him than ever yet, and partly by reason of an appearance of uncertainty in her health, co-incident and equally new. It was characteristic of the inner detachment he had hitherto so successfully cultivated and to which our whole account of him is a reference, it was characteristic that his complications, such as they were, had never yet seemed so as at this crisis to thicken about him, even to the point of making him ask himself if he were, by any chance, of a truth, within sight or sound, within touch or reach, within the immediate jurisdiction, of the thing that waited.<br> <br> When the day came, as come it had to, that his friend confessed to him her fear of a deep disorder in her blood, he felt somehow the shadow of a change and the chill of a shock. He immediately began to imagine aggravations and disasters, and above all to think of her peril as the direct menace for himself of personal privation. This indeed gave him one of those partial recoveries of equanimity that were agreeable to him--it showed him that what was still first in his mind was the loss she herself might suffer. ‘What if she should have to die before knowing, before seeing--?’ It would have been brutal, in the early stages of her trouble, to put that question to her; but it had immediately sounded for him to his own concern, and the possibility was what most made him sorry for her. If she did ‘know,’ moreover, in the sense of her having had some-- what should he think?--mystical irresistible light, this would make the matter not better, but worse, inasmuch as her original adoption of his own curiosity had quite become the basis of her life. She had been living to see what would BE to be seen, and it would quite lacerate her to have to give up before the accomplishment of the vision. These reflexions, as I say, quickened his generosity; yet, make them as he might, he saw himself, with the lapse of the period, more and more disconcerted. It lapsed for him with a strange steady sweep, and the oddest oddity was that it gave him, independently of the threat of much inconvenience, almost the only positive surprise his career, if career it could be called, had yet offered him. She kept the house as she had never done; he had to go to her to see her--she could meet him nowhere now, though there was scarce a corner of their loved old London in which she hadn't in the past, at one time or another, done so; and he found her always seated by her fire in the deep old-fashioned chair she was less and less able to leave. He had been struck one day, after an absence exceeding his usual measure, with her suddenly looking much older to him than he had ever thought of her being; then he recognised that the suddenness was all on his side--he had just simply and suddenly noticed. She looked older because inevitably, after so many years, she WAS old, or almost; which was of course true in still greater measure of her companion. If she was old, or almost, John Marcher assuredly was, and yet it was her showing of the lesson, not his own, that brought the truth home to him. His surprises began here; when once they had begun they multiplied; they came rather with a rush: it was as if, in the oddest way in the world, they had all been kept back, sown in a thick cluster, for the late afternoon of life, the time at which for people in general the unexpected has died out.<br> <br> One of them was that he should have caught himself--for he HAD so done--REALLY wondering if the great accident would take form now as nothing more than his being condemned to see this charming woman, this admirable friend, pass away from him. He had never so unreservedly qualified her as while confronted in thought with such a possibility; in spite of which there was small doubt for him that as an answer to his long riddle the mere effacement of even so fine a feature of his situation would be an abject anticlimax. It would represent, as connected with his past attitude, a drop of dignity under the shadow of which his existence could only become the most grotesques of failures. He had been far from holding it a failure- -long as he had waited for the appearance that was to make it a success. He had waited for quite another thing, not for such a thing as that. The breath of his good faith came short, however, as he recognised how long he had waited, or how long at least his companion had. That she, at all events, might be recorded as having waited in vain--this affected him sharply, and all the more because of his it first having done little more than amuse himself with the idea. It grew more grave as the gravity of her condition grew, and the state of mind it produced in him, which he himself ended by watching as if it had been some definite disfigurement of his outer person, may pass for another of his surprises. This conjoined itself still with another, the really stupefying consciousness of a question that he would have allowed to shape itself had he dared. What did everything mean--what, that is, did SHE mean, she and her vain waiting and her probable death and the soundless admonition of it all--unless that, at this time of day, it was simply, it was overwhelmingly too late? He had never at any stage of his queer consciousness admitted the whisper of such a correction; he had never till within these last few months been so false to his conviction as not to hold that what was to come to him had time, whether HE struck himself as having it or not. That at last, at last, he certainly hadn't it, to speak of, or had it but in the scantiest measure--such, soon enough, as things went with him, became the inference with which his old obsession had to reckon: and this it was not helped to do by the more and more confirmed appearance that the great vagueness casting the long shadow in which he had lived had, to attest itself, almost no margin left. Since it was in Time that he was to have met his fate, so it was in Time that his fate was to have acted; and as he waked up to the sense of no longer being young, which was exactly the sense of being stale, just as that, in turn, was the sense of being weak, he waked up to another matter beside. It all hung together; they were subject, he and the great vagueness, to an equal and indivisible law. When the possibilities themselves had accordingly turned stale, when the secret of the gods had grown faint, had perhaps even quite evaporated, that, and that only, was failure. It wouldn't have been failure to be bankrupt, dishonoured, pilloried, hanged; it was failure not to be anything. And so, in the dark valley into which his path had taken its unlooked-for twist, he wondered not a little as he groped. He didn't care what awful crash might overtake him, with what ignominy or what monstrosity he might yet he associated--since he wasn't after all too utterly old to suffer--if it would only be decently proportionate to the posture he had kept, all his life, in the threatened presence of it. He had but one desire left--that he shouldn't have been ‘sold.’<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER IV<br> <br> <br> <br> Then it was that, one afternoon, while the spring of the year was young and new she met all in her own way his frankest betrayal of these alarms. He had gone in late to see her, but evening hadn't settled and she was presented to him in that long fresh light of waning April days which affects us often with a sadness sharper than the greyest hours of autumn. The week had been warm, the spring was supposed to have begun early, and May Bartram sat, for the first time in the year, without a fire; a fact that, to Marcher's sense, gave the scene of which she formed part a smooth and ultimate look, an air of knowing, in its immaculate order and cold meaningless cheer, that it would never see a fire again. Her own aspect--he could scarce have said why--intensified this note. Almost as white as wax, with the marks and signs in her face as numerous and as fine as if they had been etched by a needle, with soft white draperies relieved by a faded green scarf on the delicate tone of which the years had further refined, she was the picture of a serene and exquisite but impenetrable sphinx, whose head, or indeed all whose person, might have been powdered with silver. She was a sphinx, yet with her white petals and green fronds she might have been a lily too--only an artificial lily, wonderfully imitated and constantly kept, without dust or stain, though not exempt from a slight droop and a complexity of faint creases, under some clear glass bell. The perfection of household care, of high polish and finish, always reigned in her rooms, but they now looked most as if everything had been wound up, tucked in, put away, so that she might sit with folded hands and with nothing more to do. She was ‘out of it,’ to Marcher's vision; her work was over; she communicated with him as across some gulf or from some island of rest that she had already reached, and it made him feel strangely abandoned. Was it--or rather wasn't it--that if for so long she had been watching with him the answer to their question must have swum into her ken and taken on its name, so that her occupation was verily gone? He had as much as charged her with this in saying to her, many months before, that she even then knew something she was keeping from him. It was a point he had never since ventured to press, vaguely fearing as he did that it might become a difference, perhaps a disagreement, between them. He had in this later time turned nervous, which was what he in all the other years had never been; and the oddity was that his nervousness should have waited till he had begun to doubt, should have held off so long as he was sure. There was something, it seemed to him, that the wrong word would bring down on his head, something that would so at least ease off his tension. But he wanted not to speak the wrong word; that would make everything ugly. He wanted the knowledge he lacked to drop on him, if drop it could, by its own august weight. If she was to forsake him it was surely for her to take leave. This was why he didn't directly ask her again what she knew; but it was also why, approaching the matter from another side, he said to her in the course of his visit: ‘What do you regard as the very worst that at this time of day CAN happen to me?’<br> <br> He had asked her that in the past often enough; they had, with the odd irregular rhythm of their intensities and avoidances, exchanged ideas about it and then had seen the ideas washed away by cool intervals, washed like figures traced in sea-sand. It had ever been the mark of their talk that the oldest allusions in it required but a little dismissal and reaction to come out again, sounding for the hour as new. She could thus at present meet his enquiry quite freshly and patiently. ‘Oh yes, I've repeatedly thought, only it always seemed to me of old that I couldn't quite make up my mind. I thought of dreadful things, between which it was difficult to choose; and so must you have done.’<br> <br> ‘Rather! I feel now as if I had scarce done anything else. I appear to myself to have spent my life in thinking of nothing but dreadful things. A great many of them I've at different times named to you, but there were others I couldn't name.’<br> <br> ‘They were too, too dreadful?’<br> <br> ‘Too, too dreadful--some of them.’<br> <br> She looked at him a minute, and there came to him as he met it, an inconsequent sense that her eyes, when one got their full clearness, were still as beautiful as they had been in youth, only beautiful with a strange cold light--a light that somehow was a part of the effect, if it wasn't rather a part of the cause, of the pale hard sweetness of the season and the hour. ‘And yet,’ she said at last, ‘there are horrors we've mentioned.’<br> <br> It deepened the strangeness to see her, as such a figure in such a picture, talk of ‘horrors,’ but she was to do in a few minutes something stranger yet--though even of this he was to take the full measure but afterwards--and the note of it already trembled. It was, for the matter of that, one of the signs that her eyes were having again the high flicker of their prime. He had to admit, however, what she said. ‘Oh yes, there were times when we did go far.’ He caught himself in the act of speaking as if it all were over. Well, he wished it were; and the consummation depended for him clearly more and more on his friend.<br> <br> But she had now a soft smile. ‘Oh far--!’<br> <br> It was oddly ironic. ‘Do you mean you're prepared to go further?’<br> <br> She was frail and ancient and charming as she continued to look at him, yet it was rather as if she had lost the thread. ‘Do you consider that we went far?’<br> <br> ‘Why I thought it the point you were just making--that we HAD looked most things in the face.’<br> <br> ‘Including each other?’ She still smiled. ‘But you're quite right. We've had together great imaginations, often great fears; but some of them have been unspoken.’<br> <br> ‘Then the worst--we haven't faced that. I COULD face it, I believe, if I knew what you think it. I feel,’ he explained, ‘as if I had lost my power to conceive such things.’ And he wondered if he looked as blank as he sounded. ‘It's spent.’<br> <br> ‘Then why do you assume,’ she asked, ‘that mine isn't?’<br> <br> ‘Because you've given me signs to the contrary. It isn't a question for you of conceiving, imagining, comparing. It isn't a question now of choosing.’ At last he came out with it. ‘You know something I don't. You've shown me that before.’<br> <br> These last words had affected her, he made out in a moment, exceedingly, and she spoke with firmness. ‘I've shown you, my dear, nothing.’<br> <br> He shook his head. ‘You can't hide it.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, oh!’ May Bartram sounded over what she couldn't hide. It was almost a smothered groan.<br> <br> ‘You admitted it months ago, when I spoke of it to you as of something you were afraid I should find out. Your answer was that I couldn't, that I wouldn't, and I don't pretend I have. But you had something therefore in mind, and I see now how it must have been, how it still is, the possibility that, of all possibilities, has settled itself for you as the worst. This,’ he went on, ‘is why I appeal to you. I'm only afraid of ignorance to-day--I'm not afraid of knowledge.’ And then as for a while she said nothing: ‘What makes me sure is that I see in your face and feel here, in this air and amid these appearances, that you're out of it. You've done. You've had your experience. You leave me to my fate.’<br> <br> Well, she listened, motionless and white in her chair, as on a decision to be made, so that her manner was fairly an avowal, though still, with a small fine inner stiffness, an imperfect surrender. ‘It WOULD be the worst,’ she finally let herself say. ‘I mean the thing I've never said.’<br> <br> It hushed him a moment. ‘More monstrous than all the monstrosities we've named?’<br> <br> ‘More monstrous. Isn't that what you sufficiently express,’ she asked, ‘in calling it the worst?’<br> <br> Marcher thought. ‘Assuredly--if you mean, as I do, something that includes all the loss and all the shame that are thinkable.’<br> <br> ‘It would if it SHOULD happen,’ said May Bartram. ‘What we're speaking of, remember, is only my idea.’<br> <br> ‘It's your belief,’ Marcher returned. ‘That's enough for me. I feel your beliefs are right. Therefore if, having this one, you give me no more light on it, you abandon me.’<br> <br> ‘No, no!’ she repeated. ‘I'm with you--don't you see?--still.’ And as to make it more vivid to him she rose from her chair--a movement she seldom risked in these days--and showed herself, all draped and all soft, in her fairness and slimness. ‘I haven't forsaken you.’<br> <br> It was really, in its effort against weakness, a generous assurance, and had the success of the impulse not, happily, been great, it would have touched him to pain more than to pleasure. But the cold charm in her eyes had spread, as she hovered before him, to all the rest of her person, so that it was for the minute almost a recovery of youth. He couldn't pity her for that; he could only take her as she showed--as capable even yet of helping him. It was as if, at the same time, her light might at any instant go out; wherefore he must make the most of it. There passed before him with intensity the three or four things he wanted most to know; but the question that came of itself to his lips really covered the others. ‘Then tell me if I shall consciously suffer.’<br> <br> She promptly shook her head. ‘Never!’<br> <br> It confirmed the authority he imputed to her, and it produced on him an extraordinary effect. ‘Well, what's better than that? Do you call that the worst?’<br> <br> ‘You think nothing is better?’ she asked.<br> <br> She seemed to mean something so special that he again sharply wondered, though still with the dawn of a prospect of relief. ‘Why not, if one doesn't KNOW?’ After which, as their eyes, over his question, met in a silence, the dawn deepened, and something to his purpose came prodigiously out of her very face. His own, as he took it in, suddenly flushed to the forehead, and he gasped with the force of a perception to which, on the instant, everything fitted. The sound of his gasp filled the air; then he became articulate. ‘I see--if I don't suffer!’<br> <br> In her own look, however, was doubt. ‘You see what?’<br> <br> ‘Why what you mean--what you've always meant.’<br> <br> She again shook her head. ‘What I mean isn't what I've always meant. It's different.’<br> <br> ‘It's something new?’<br> <br> She hung back from it a little. ‘Something new. It's not what you think. I see what you think.’<br> <br> His divination drew breath then; only her correction might be wrong. ‘It isn't that I AM a blockhead?’ he asked between faintness and grimness. ‘It isn't that it's all a mistake?’<br> <br> ‘A mistake?’ she pityingly echoed. THAT possibility, for her, he saw, would be monstrous; and if she guaranteed him the immunity from pain it would accordingly not be what she had in mind. ‘Oh no,’ she declared; ‘it's nothing of that sort. You've been right.’<br> <br> Yet he couldn't help asking himself if she weren't, thus pressed, speaking but to save him. It seemed to him he should be most in a hole if his history should prove all a platitude. ‘Are you telling me the truth, so that I shan't have been a bigger idiot than I can bear to know? I HAVEN'T lived with a vain imagination, in the most besotted illusion? I haven't waited but to see the door shut in my face?’<br> <br> She shook her head again. ‘However the case stands THAT isn't the truth. Whatever the reality, it IS a reality. The door isn't shut. The door's open,’ said May Bartram.<br> <br> ‘Then something's to come?’<br> <br> She waited once again, always with her cold sweet eyes on him. ‘It's never too late.’ She had, with her gliding step, diminished the distance between them, and she stood nearer to him, close to him, a minute, as if still charged with the unspoken. Her movement might have been for some finer emphasis of what she was at once hesitating and deciding to say. He had been standing by the chimney-piece, fireless and sparely adorned, a small perfect old French clock and two morsels of rosy Dresden constituting all its furniture; and her hand grasped the shelf while she kept him waiting, grasped it a little as for support and encouragement. She only kept him waiting, however; that is he only waited. It had become suddenly, from her movement and attitude, beautiful and vivid to him that she had something more to give him; her wasted face delicately shone with it--it glittered almost as with the white lustre of silver in her expression. She was right, incontestably, for what he saw in her face was the truth, and strangely, without consequence, while their talk of it as dreadful was still in the air, she appeared to present it as inordinately soft. This, prompting bewilderment, made him but gape the more gratefully for her revelation, so that they continued for some minutes silent, her face shining at him, her contact imponderably pressing, and his stare all kind but all expectant. The end, none the less, was that what he had expected failed to come to him. Something else took place instead, which seemed to consist at first in the mere closing of her eyes. She gave way at the same instant to a slow fine shudder, and though he remained staring--though he stared in fact but the harder--turned off and regained her chair. It was the end of what she had been intending, but it left him thinking only of that.<br> <br> ‘Well, you don't say--?’<br> <br> She had touched in her passage a bell near the chimney and had sunk back strangely pale. ‘I'm afraid I'm too ill.’<br> <br> ‘Too ill to tell me?’ it sprang up sharp to him, and almost to his lips, the fear she might die without giving him light. He checked himself in time from so expressing his question, but she answered as if she had heard the words.<br> <br> ‘Don't you know--now?’<br> <br> ‘'Now' -?’ She had spoken as if some difference had been made within the moment. But her maid, quickly obedient to her bell, was already with them. ‘I know nothing.’ And he was afterwards to say to himself that he must have spoken with odious impatience, such an impatience as to show that, supremely disconcerted, he washed his hands of the whole question.<br> <br> ‘Oh!’ said May Bartram.<br> <br> ‘Are you in pain?’ he asked as the woman went to her.<br> <br> ‘No,’ said May Bartram.<br> <br> Her maid, who had put an arm round her as if to take her to her room, fixed on him eyes that appealingly contradicted her; in spite of which, however, he showed once more his mystification.<br> <br> ‘What then has happened?’<br> <br> She was once more, with her companion's help, on her feet, and, feeling withdrawal imposed on him, he had blankly found his hat and gloves and had reached the door. Yet he waited for her answer. ‘What WAS to,’ she said.<br> <br>CHAPTER V<br> <br>He came back the next day, but she was then unable to see him, and as it was literally the first time this had occurred in the long stretch of their acquaintance he turned away, defeated and sore, almost angry--or feeling at least that such a break in their custom was really the beginning of the end--and wandered alone with his thoughts, especially with the one he was least able to keep down. She was dying and he would lose her; she was dying and his life would end. He stopped in the Park, into which he had passed, and stared before him at his recurrent doubt. Away from her the doubt pressed again; in her presence he had believed her, but as he felt his forlornness he threw himself into the explanation that, nearest at hand, had most of a miserable warmth for him and least of a cold torment. She had deceived him to save him--to put him off with something in which he should be able to rest. What could the thing that was to happen to him be, after all, but just this thing that had began to happen? Her dying, her death, his consequent solitude--that was what he had figured as the Beast in the Jungle, that was what had been in the lap of the gods. He had had her word for it as he left her--what else on earth could she have meant? It wasn't a thing of a monstrous order; not a fate rare and distinguished; not a stroke of fortune that overwhelmed and immortalised; it had only the stamp of the common doom. But poor Marcher at this hour judged the common doom sufficient. It would serve his turn, and even as the consummation of infinite waiting he would bend his pride to accept it. He sat down on a bench in the twilight. He hadn't been a fool. Something had BEEN, as she had said, to come. Before he rose indeed it had quite struck him that the final fact really matched with the long avenue through which he had had to reach it. As sharing his suspense and as giving herself all, giving her life, to bring it to an end, she had come with him every step of the way. He had lived by her aid, and to leave her behind would be cruelly, damnably to miss her. What could be more overwhelming than that?<br> <br> Well, he was to know within the week, for though she kept him a while at bay, left him restless and wretched during a series of days on each of which he asked about her only again to have to turn away, she ended his trial by receiving him where she had always received him. Yet she had been brought out at some hazard into the presence of so many of the things that were, consciously, vainly, half their past, and there was scant service left in the gentleness of her mere desire, all too visible, to check his obsession and wind up his long trouble. That was clearly what she wanted; the one thing more for her own peace while she could still put out her hand. He was so affected by her state that, once seated by her chair, he was moved to let everything go; it was she herself therefore who brought him back, took up again, before she dismissed him, her last word of the other time. She showed how she wished to leave their business in order. ‘I'm not sure you understood. You've nothing to wait for more. It HAS come.’<br> <br> Oh how he looked at her! ‘Really?’<br> <br> ‘Really.’<br> <br> ‘The thing that, as you said, WAS to?’<br> <br> ‘The thing that we began in our youth to watch for.’<br> <br> Face to face with her once more he believed her; it was a claim to which he had so abjectly little to oppose. ‘You mean that it has come as a positive definite occurrence, with a name and a date?’<br> <br> ‘Positive. Definite. I don't know about the 'name,' but, oh with a date!’<br> <br> He found himself again too helplessly at sea. ‘But come in the night--come and passed me by?’<br> <br> May Bartram had her strange faint smile. ‘Oh no, it hasn't passed you by!’<br> <br> ‘But if I haven't been aware of it and it hasn't touched me--?’<br> <br> ‘Ah your not being aware of it’--and she seemed to hesitate an instant to deal with this--’your not being aware of it is the strangeness in the strangeness. It's the wonder OF the wonder.’ She spoke as with the softness almost of a sick child, yet now at last, at the end of all, with the perfect straightness of a sibyl. She visibly knew that she knew, and the effect on him was of something co-ordinate, in its high character, with the law that had ruled him. It was the true voice of the law; so on her lips would the law itself have sounded. ‘It HAS touched you,’ she went on. ‘It has done its office. It has made you all its own.’<br> <br> ‘So utterly without my knowing it?’<br> <br> ‘So utterly without your knowing it.’ His hand, as he leaned to her, was on the arm of her chair, and, dimly smiling always now, she placed her own on it. ‘It's enough if I know it.’<br> <br> ‘Oh!’ he confusedly breathed, as she herself of late so often had done.<br> <br> ‘What I long ago said is true. You'll never know now, and I think you ought to be content. You've HAD it,’ said May Bartram.<br> <br> ‘But had what?’<br> <br> ‘Why what was to have marked you out. The proof of your law. It has acted. I'm too glad,’ she then bravely added, ‘to have been able to see what it's NOT.’<br> <br> He continued to attach his eyes to her, and with the sense that it was all beyond him, and that SHE was too, he would still have sharply challenged her hadn't he so felt it an abuse of her weakness to do more than take devoutly what she gave him, take it hushed as to a revelation. If he did speak, it was out of the foreknowledge of his loneliness to come. ‘If you're glad of what it's 'not' it might then have been worse?’<br> <br> She turned her eyes away, she looked straight before her; with which after a moment: ‘Well, you know our fears.’<br> <br> He wondered. ‘It's something then we never feared?’<br> <br> On this slowly she turned to him. ‘Did we ever dream, with all our dreams, that we should sit and talk of it thus?’<br> <br> He tried for a little to make out that they had; but it was as if their dreams, numberless enough, were in solution in some thick cold mist through which thought lost itself. ‘It might have been that we couldn't talk.’<br> <br> ‘Well’--she did her best for him--’not from this side. This, you see,’ she said, ‘is the OTHER side.’<br> <br> ‘I think,’ poor Marcher returned, ‘that all sides are the same to me.’ Then, however, as she gently shook her head in correction: ‘We mightn't, as it were, have got across--?’<br> <br> ‘To where we are--no. We're HERE’--she made her weak emphasis.<br> <br> ‘And much good does it do us!’ was her friend's frank comment.<br> <br> ‘It does us the good it can. It does us the good that IT isn't here. It's past. It's behind,’ said May Bartram. ‘Before--’ but her voice dropped.<br> <br> He had got up, not to tire her, but it was hard to combat his yearning. She after all told him nothing but that his light had failed--which he knew well enough without her. ‘Before--?’ he blankly echoed.<br> <br> ‘Before you see, it was always to COME. That kept it present.’<br> <br> ‘Oh I don't care what comes now! Besides,’ Marcher added, ‘it seems to me I liked it better present, as you say, than I can like it absent with YOUR absence.’<br> <br> ‘Oh mine!’--and her pale hands made light of it.<br> <br> ‘With the absence of everything.’ He had a dreadful sense of standing there before her for--so far as anything but this proved, this bottomless drop was concerned--the last time of their life. It rested on him with a weight he felt he could scarce bear, and this weight it apparently was that still pressed out what remained in him of speakable protest. ‘I believe you; but I can't begin to pretend I understand. NOTHING, for me, is past; nothing WILL pass till I pass myself, which I pray my stars may be as soon as possible. Say, however,’ he added, ‘that I've eaten my cake, as you contend, to the last crumb--how can the thing I've never felt at all be the thing I was marked out to feel?’<br> <br> She met him perhaps less directly, but she met him unperturbed. ‘You take your 'feelings' for granted. You were to suffer your fate. That was not necessarily to know it.’<br> <br> ‘How in the world--when what is such knowledge but suffering?’<br> <br> She looked up at him a while in silence. ‘No--you don't understand.’<br> <br> ‘I suffer,’ said John Marcher.<br> <br> ‘Don't, don't!’<br> <br> ‘How can I help at least THAT?’<br> <br> ‘DON'T!’ May Bartram repeated.<br> <br> She spoke it in a tone so special, in spite of her weakness, that he stared an instant--stared as if some light, hitherto hidden, had shimmered across his vision. Darkness again closed over it, but the gleam had already become for him an idea. ‘Because I haven't the right--?’<br> <br> ‘Don't KNOW--when you needn't,’ she mercifully urged. ‘You needn't--for we shouldn't.’<br> <br> ‘Shouldn't?’ If he could but know what she meant!<br> <br> ‘No--it's too much.’<br> <br> ‘Too much?’ he still asked but with a mystification that was the next moment of a sudden to give way. Her words, if they meant something, affected him in this light--the light also of her wasted face--as meaning ALL, and the sense of what knowledge had been for herself came over him with a rush which broke through into a question. ‘Is it of that then you're dying?’<br> <br> She but watched him, gravely at first, as to see, with this, where he was, and she might have seen something or feared something that moved her sympathy. ‘I would live for you still--if I could.’ Her eyes closed for a little, as if, withdrawn into herself, she were for a last time trying. ‘But I can't!’ she said as she raised them again to take leave of him.<br> <br> She couldn't indeed, as but too promptly and sharply appeared, and he had no vision of her after this that was anything but darkness and doom. They had parted for ever in that strange talk; access to her chamber of pain, rigidly guarded, was almost wholly forbidden him; he was feeling now moreover, in the face of doctors, nurses, the two or three relatives attracted doubtless by the presumption of what she had to ‘leave,’ how few were the rights, as they were called in such cases, that he had to put forward, and how odd it might even seem that their intimacy shouldn't have given him more of them. The stupidest fourth cousin had more, even though she had been nothing in such a person's life. She had been a feature of features in HIS, for what else was it to have been so indispensable? Strange beyond saying were the ways of existence, baffling for him the anomaly of his lack, as he felt it to be, of producible claim. A woman might have been, as it were, everything to him, and it might yet present him, in no connexion that any one seemed held to recognise. If this was the case in these closing weeks it was the case more sharply on the occasion of the last offices rendered, in the great grey London cemetery, to what had been mortal, to what had been precious, in his friend. The concourse at her grave was not numerous, but he saw himself treated as scarce more nearly concerned with it than if there had been a thousand others. He was in short from this moment face to face with the fact that he was to profit extraordinarily little by the interest May Bartram had taken in him. He couldn't quite have said what he expected, but he hadn't surely expected this approach to a double privation. Not only had her interest failed him, but he seemed to feel himself unattended--and for a reason he couldn't seize--by the distinction, the dignity, the propriety, if nothing else, of the man markedly bereaved. It was as if, in the view of society he had not BEEN markedly bereaved, as if there still failed some sign or proof of it, and as if none the less his character could never be affirmed nor the deficiency ever made up. There were moments as the weeks went by when he would have liked, by some almost aggressive act, to take his stand on the intimacy of his loss, in order that it MIGHT be questioned and his retort, to the relief of his spirit, so recorded; but the moments of an irritation more helpless followed fast on these, the moments during which, turning things over with a good conscience but with a bare horizon, he found himself wondering if he oughtn't to have begun, so to speak, further back.<br> <br> He found himself wondering indeed at many things, and this last speculation had others to keep it company. What could he have done, after all, in her lifetime, without giving them both, as it were, away? He couldn't have made known she was watching him, for that would have published the superstition of the Beast. This was what closed his mouth now--now that the Jungle had been thrashed to vacancy and that the Beast had stolen away. It sounded too foolish and too flat; the difference for him in this particular, the extinction in his life of the element of suspense, was such as in fact to surprise him. He could scarce have said what the effect resembled; the abrupt cessation, the positive prohibition, of music perhaps, more than anything else, in some place all adjusted and all accustomed to sonority and to attention. If he could at any rate have conceived lifting the veil from his image at some moment of the past (what had he done, after all, if not lift it to HER?) so to do this to-day, to talk to people at large of the Jungle cleared and confide to them that he now felt it as safe, would have been not only to see them listen as to a goodwife's tale, but really to hear himself tell one. What it presently came to in truth was that poor Marcher waded through his beaten grass, where no life stirred, where no breath sounded, where no evil eye seemed to gleam from a possible lair, very much as if vaguely looking for the Beast, and still more as if acutely missing it. He walked about in an existence that had grown strangely more spacious, and, stopping fitfully in places where the undergrowth of life struck him as closer, asked himself yearningly, wondered secretly and sorely, if it would have lurked here or there. It would have at all events sprung; what was at least complete was his belief in the truth itself of the assurance given him. The change from his old sense to his new was absolute and final: what was to happen had so absolutely and finally happened that he was as little able to know a fear for his future as to know a hope; so absent in short was any question of anything still to come. He was to live entirely with the other question, that of his unidentified past, that of his having to see his fortune impenetrably muffled and masked.<br> <br> The torment of this vision became then his occupation; he couldn't perhaps have consented to live but for the possibility of guessing. She had told him, his friend, not to guess; she had forbidden him, so far as he might, to know, and she had even in a sort denied the power in him to learn: which were so many things, precisely, to deprive him of rest. It wasn't that he wanted, he argued for fairness, that anything past and done should repeat itself; it was only that he shouldn't, as an anticlimax, have been taken sleeping so sound as not to be able to win back by an effort of thought the lost stuff of consciousness. He declared to himself at moments that he would either win it back or have done with consciousness for ever; he made this idea his one motive in fine, made it so much his passion that none other, to compare with it, seemed ever to have touched him. The lost stuff of consciousness became thus for him as a strayed or stolen child to an unappeasable father; he hunted it up and down very much as if he were knocking at doors and enquiring of the police. This was the spirit in which, inevitably, he set himself to travel; he started on a journey that was to be as long as he could make it; it danced before him that, as the other side of the globe couldn't possibly have less to say to him, it might, by a possibility of suggestion, have more. Before he quitted London, however, he made a pilgrimage to May Bartram's grave, took his way to it through the endless avenues of the grim suburban necropolis, sought it out in the wilderness of tombs, and, though he had come but for the renewal of the act of farewell, found himself, when he had at last stood by it, beguiled into long intensities. He stood for an hour, powerless to turn away and yet powerless to penetrate the darkness of death; fixing with his eyes her inscribed name and date, beating his forehead against the fact of the secret they kept, drawing his breath, while he waited, as if some sense would in pity of him rise from the stones. He kneeled on the stones, however, in vain; they kept what they concealed; and if the face of the tomb did become a face for him it was because her two names became a pair of eyes that didn't know him. He gave them a last long look, but no palest light broke.<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VI<br> <br> <br> <br> He stayed away, after this, for a year; he visited the depths of Asia, spending himself on scenes of romantic interest, of superlative sanctity; but what was present to him everywhere was that for a man who had known what HE had known the world was vulgar and vain. The state of mind in which he had lived for so many years shone out to him, in reflexion, as a light that coloured and refined, a light beside which the glow of the East was garish cheap and thin. The terrible truth was that he had lost--with everything else--a distinction as well the things he saw couldn't help being common when he had become common to look at them. He was simply now one of them himself--he was in the dust, without a peg for the sense of difference; and there were hours when, before the temples of gods and the sepulchres of kings, his spirit turned for nobleness of association to the barely discriminated slab in the London suburb. That had become for him, and more intensely with time and distance, his one witness of a past glory. It was all that was left to him for proof or pride, yet the past glories of Pharaohs were nothing to him as he thought of it. Small wonder then that he came back to it on the morrow of his return. He was drawn there this time as irresistibly as the other, yet with a confidence, almost, that was doubtless the effect of the many months that had elapsed. He had lived, in spite of himself, into his change of feeling, and in wandering over the earth had wandered, as might be said, from the circumference to the centre of his desert. He had settled to his safety and accepted perforce his extinction; figuring to himself, with some colour, in the likeness of certain little old men he remembered to have seen, of whom, all meagre and wizened as they might look, it was related that they had in their time fought twenty duels or been loved by ten princesses. They indeed had been wondrous for others while he was but wondrous for himself; which, however, was exactly the cause of his haste to renew the wonder by getting back, as he might put it, into his own presence. That had quickened his steps and checked his delay. If his visit was prompt it was because he had been separated so long from the part of himself that alone he now valued.<br> <br> It's accordingly not false to say that he reached his goal with a certain elation and stood there again with a certain assurance. The creature beneath the sod knew of his rare experience, so that, strangely now, the place had lost for him its mere blankness of expression. It met him in mildness--not, as before, in mockery; it wore for him the air of conscious greeting that we find, after absence, in things that have closely belonged to us and which seem to confess of themselves to the connexion. The plot of ground, the graven tablet, the tended flowers affected him so as belonging to him that he resembled for the hour a contented landlord reviewing a piece of property. Whatever had happened--well, had happened. He had not come back this time with the vanity of that question, his former worrying ‘What, WHAT?’ now practically so spent. Yet he would none the less never again so cut himself off from the spot; he would come back to it every month, for if he did nothing else by its aid he at least held up his head. It thus grew for him, in the oddest way, a positive resource; he carried out his idea of periodical returns, which took their place at last among the most inveterate of his habits. What it all amounted to, oddly enough, was that in his finally so simplified world this garden of death gave him the few square feet of earth on which he could still most live. It was as if, being nothing anywhere else for any one, nothing even for himself, he were just everything here, and if not for a crowd of witnesses or indeed for any witness but John Marcher, then by clear right of the register that he could scan like an open page. The open page was the tomb of his friend, and there were the facts of the past, there the truth of his life, there the backward reaches in which he could lose himself. He did this from time to time with such effect that he seemed to wander through the old years with his hand in the arm of a companion who was, in the most extraordinary manner, his other, his younger self; and to wander, which was more extraordinary yet, round and round a third presence--not wandering she, but stationary, still, whose eyes, turning with his revolution, never ceased to follow him, and whose seat was his point, so to speak, of orientation. Thus in short he settled to live--feeding all on the sense that he once HAD lived, and dependent on it not alone for a support but for an identity.<br> <br> It sufficed him in its way for months and the year elapsed; it would doubtless even have carried him further but for an accident, superficially slight, which moved him, quite in another direction, with a force beyond any of his impressions of Egypt or of India. It was a thing of the merest chance--the turn, as he afterwards felt, of a hair, though he was indeed to live to believe that if light hadn't come to him in this particular fashion it would still have come in another. He was to live to believe this, I say, though he was not to live, I may not less definitely mention, to do much else. We allow him at any rate the benefit of the conviction, struggling up for him at the end, that, whatever might have happened or not happened, he would have come round of himself to the light. The incident of an autumn day had put the match to the train laid from of old by his misery. With the light before him he knew that even of late his ache had only been smothered. It was strangely drugged, but it throbbed; at the touch it began to bleed. And the touch, in the event, was the face of a fellow-mortal. This face, one grey afternoon when the leaves were thick in the alleys, looked into Marcher's own, at the cemetery, with an expression like the cut of a blade. He felt it, that is, so deep down that he winced at the steady thrust. The person who so mutely assaulted him was a figure he had noticed, on reaching his own goal, absorbed by a grave a short distance away, a grave apparently fresh, so that the emotion of the visitor would probably match it for frankness. This fact alone forbade further attention, though during the time he stayed he remained vaguely conscious of his neighbour, a middle- aged man apparently, in mourning, whose bowed back, among the clustered monuments and mortuary yews, was constantly presented. Marcher's theory that these were elements in contact with which he himself revived, had suffered, on this occasion, it may be granted, a marked, an excessive check. The autumn day was dire for him as none had recently been, and he rested with a heaviness he had not yet known on the low stone table that bore May Bartram's name. He rested without power to move, as if some spring in him, some spell vouchsafed, had suddenly been broken for ever. If he could have done that moment as he wanted he would simply have stretched himself on the slab that was ready to take him, treating it as a place prepared to receive his last sleep. What in all the wide world had he now to keep awake for? He stared before him with the question, and it was then that, as one of the cemetery walks passed near him, he caught the shock of the face.<br> <br> His neighbour at the other grave had withdrawn, as he himself, with force enough in him, would have done by now, and was advancing along the path on his way to one of the gates. This brought him close, and his pace, was slow, so that--and all the more as there was a kind of hunger in his look--the two men were for a minute directly confronted. Marcher knew him at once for one of the deeply stricken--a perception so sharp that nothing else in the picture comparatively lived, neither his dress, his age, nor his presumable character and class; nothing lived but the deep ravage of the features that he showed. He SHOWED them--that was the point; he was moved, as he passed, by some impulse that was either a signal for sympathy or, more possibly, a challenge to an opposed sorrow. He might already have been aware of our friend, might at some previous hour have noticed in him the smooth habit of the scene, with which the state of his own senses so scantly consorted, and might thereby have been stirred as by an overt discord. What Marcher was at all events conscious of was in the first place that the image of scarred passion presented to him was conscious too--of something that profaned the air; and in the second that, roused, startled, shocked, he was yet the next moment looking after it, as it went, with envy. The most extraordinary thing that had happened to him--though he had given that name to other matters as well-- took place, after his immediate vague stare, as a consequence of this impression. The stranger passed, but the raw glare of his grief remained, making our friend wonder in pity what wrong, what wound it expressed, what injury not to be healed. What had the man HAD, to make him by the loss of it so bleed and yet live?<br> <br> Something--and this reached him with a pang--that HE, John Marcher, hadn't; the proof of which was precisely John Marcher's arid end. No passion had ever touched him, for this was what passion meant; he had survived and maundered and pined, but where had been HIS deep ravage? The extraordinary thing we speak of was the sudden rush of the result of this question. The sight that had just met his eyes named to him, as in letters of quick flame, something he had utterly, insanely missed, and what he had missed made these things a train of fire, made them mark themselves in an anguish of inward throbs. He had seen OUTSIDE of his life, not learned it within, the way a woman was mourned when she had been loved for herself: such was the force of his conviction of the meaning of the stranger's face, which still flared for him as a smoky torch. It hadn't come to him, the knowledge, on the wings of experience; it had brushed him, jostled him, upset him, with the disrespect of chance, the insolence of accident. Now that the illumination had begun, however, it blazed to the zenith, and what he presently stood there gazing at was the sounded void of his life. He gazed, he drew breath, in pain; he turned in his dismay, and, turning, he had before him in sharper incision than ever the open page of his story. The name on the table smote him as the passage of his neighbour had done, and what it said to him, full in the face, was that she was what he had missed. This was the awful thought, the answer to all the past, the vision at the dread clearness of which he turned as cold as the stone beneath him. Everything fell together, confessed, explained, overwhelmed; leaving him most of all stupefied at the blindness he had cherished. The fate he had been marked for he had met with a vengeance--he had emptied the cup to the lees; he had been the man of his time, THE man, to whom nothing on earth was to have happened. That was the rare stroke-- that was his visitation. So he saw it, as we say, in pale horror, while the pieces fitted and fitted. So SHE had seen it while he didn't, and so she served at this hour to drive the truth home. It was the truth, vivid and monstrous, that all the while he had waited the wait was itself his portion. This the companion of his vigil had at a given moment made out, and she had then offered him the chance to baffle his doom. One's doom, however, was never baffled, and on the day she told him his own had come down she had seen him but stupidly stare at the escape she offered him.<br> <br> The escape would have been to love her; then, THEN he would have lived. SHE had lived--who could say now with what passion?--since she had loved him for himself; whereas he had never thought of her (ah how it hugely glared at him!) but in the chill of his egotism and the light of her use. Her spoken words came back to him--the chain stretched and stretched. The Beast had lurked indeed, and the Beast, at its hour, had sprung; it had sprung in that twilight of the cold April when, pale, ill, wasted, but all beautiful, and perhaps even then recoverable, she had risen from her chair to stand before him and let him imaginably guess. It had sprung as he didn't guess; it had sprung as she hopelessly turned from him, and the mark, by the time he left her, had fallen where it WAS to fall. He had justified his fear and achieved his fate; he had failed, with the last exactitude, of all he was to fail of; and a moan now rose to his lips as he remembered she had prayed he mightn't know. This horror of waking--THIS was knowledge, knowledge under the breath of which the very tears in his eyes seemed to freeze. Through them, none the less, he tried to fix it and hold it; he kept it there before him so that he might feel the pain. That at least, belated and bitter, had something of the taste of life. But the bitterness suddenly sickened him, and it was as if, horribly, he saw, in the truth, in the cruelty of his image, what had been appointed and done. He saw the Jungle of his life and saw the lurking Beast; then, while he looked, perceived it, as by a stir of the air, rise, huge and hideous, for the leap that was to settle him. His eyes darkened--it was close; and, instinctively turning, in his hallucination, to avoid it, he flung himself, face down, on the tomb.</p><br>The story had held us, round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but later in the evening—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following. This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait. We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.<br> <br> ‘I quite agree—in regard to Griffin's ghost, or whatever it was—that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch. But it's not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child. If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to TWO children—?’<br> <br> ‘We say, of course,’ somebody exclaimed, ‘that they give two turns! Also that we want to hear about them.’<br> <br> I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. ‘Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It's quite too horrible.’ This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: ‘It's beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know touches it.’<br> <br> ‘For sheer terror?’ I remember asking.<br> <br> He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it. He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace. ‘For dreadful—dreadfulness!’<br> <br> ‘Oh, how delicious!’ cried one of the women.<br> <br> He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of. ‘For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain.’<br> <br> ‘Well then,’ I said, ‘just sit right down and begin.’<br> <br> He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant. Then as he faced us again: ‘I can't begin. I shall have to send to town.’ There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. ‘The story's written. It's in a locked drawer—it has not been out for years. I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it.’ It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this—appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence. The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me. I adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt. ‘Oh, thank God, no!’<br> <br> ‘And is the record yours? You took the thing down?’<br> <br> ‘Nothing but the impression. I took that HERE’—he tapped his heart. ‘I've never lost it.’<br> <br> ‘Then your manuscript—?’<br> <br> ‘Is in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.’ He hung fire again. ‘A woman's. She has been dead these twenty years. She sent me the pages in question before she died.’ They were all listening now, and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the inference. But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation. ‘She was a most charming person, but she was ten years older than I. She was my sister's governess,’ he quietly said. ‘She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at home on my coming down the second summer. I was much there that year—it was a beautiful one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in the garden—talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don't grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me, too. If she hadn't she wouldn't have told me. She had never told anyone. It wasn't simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn't. I was sure; I could see. You'll easily judge why when you hear.’<br> <br> ‘Because the thing had been such a scare?’<br> <br> He continued to fix me. ‘You'll easily judge,’ he repeated: ‘YOU will.’<br> <br> I fixed him, too. ‘I see. She was in love.’<br> <br> He laughed for the first time. ‘You ARE acute. Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been. That came out—she couldn't tell her story without its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither of us spoke of it. I remember the time and the place—the corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summer afternoon. It wasn't a scene for a shudder; but oh—!’ He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.<br> <br> ‘You'll receive the packet Thursday morning?’ I inquired.<br> <br> ‘Probably not till the second post.’<br> <br> ‘Well then; after dinner—’<br> <br> ‘You'll all meet me here?’ He looked us round again. ‘Isn't anybody going?’ It was almost the tone of hope.<br> <br> ‘Everybody will stay!’<br> <br> ‘I will’—and ‘I will!’ cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light. ‘Who was it she was in love with?’<br> <br> ‘The story will tell,’ I took upon myself to reply.<br> <br> ‘Oh, I can't wait for the story!’<br> <br> ‘The story WON'T tell,’ said Douglas; ‘not in any literal, vulgar way.’<br> <br> ‘More's the pity, then. That's the only way I ever understand.’<br> <br> ‘Won't YOU tell, Douglas?’ somebody else inquired.<br> <br> He sprang to his feet again. ‘Yes—tomorrow. Now I must go to bed. Good night.’ And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. ‘Well, if I don't know who she was in love with, I know who HE was.’<br> <br> ‘She was ten years older,’ said her husband.<br> <br> ‘Raison de plus—at that age! But it's rather nice, his long reticence.’<br> <br> ‘Forty years!’ Griffin put in.<br> <br> ‘With this outbreak at last.’<br> <br> ‘The outbreak,’ I returned, ‘will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;’ and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost all attention for everything else. The last story, however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and ‘candlestuck,’ as somebody said, and went to bed.<br> <br> I knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first post, gone off to his London apartments; but in spite of—or perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner, till such an hour of the evening, in fact, as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently give. Poor Douglas, before his death—when it was in sight—committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.<br> <br> The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to London, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser. This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing—this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, offhand and gay and kind. He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.<br> <br> He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position—a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience—very heavily on his hands. It had all been a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman, Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them quite beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise thoroughly respectable.<br> <br> So far had Douglas presented his picture when someone put a question. ‘And what did the former governess die of?—of so much respectability?’<br> <br> Our friend's answer was prompt. ‘That will come out. I don't anticipate.’<br> <br> ‘Excuse me—I thought that was just what you ARE doing.’<br> <br> ‘In her successor's place,’ I suggested, ‘I should have wished to learn if the office brought with it—’<br> <br> ‘Necessary danger to life?’ Douglas completed my thought. ‘She did wish to learn, and she did learn. You shall hear tomorrow what she learned. Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness. She hesitated—took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she engaged.’ And Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw in—<br> <br> ‘The moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the splendid young man. She succumbed to it.’<br> <br> He got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us. ‘She saw him only twice.’<br> <br> ‘Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion.’<br> <br> A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas turned round to me. ‘It WAS the beauty of it. There were others,’ he went on, ‘who hadn't succumbed. He told her frankly all his difficulty—that for several applicants the conditions had been prohibitive. They were, somehow, simply afraid. It sounded dull—it sounded strange; and all the more so because of his main condition.’<br> <br> ‘Which was—?’<br> <br> ‘That she should never trouble him—but never, never: neither appeal nor complain nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself, receive all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and let him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.’<br> <br> ‘But was that all her reward?’ one of the ladies asked.<br> <br> ‘She never saw him again.’<br> <br> ‘Oh!’ said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again, was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till, the next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he opened the faded red cover of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album. The whole thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first occasion the same lady put another question. ‘What is your title?’<br> <br> ‘I haven't one.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, I have!’ I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, had begun to read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the beauty of his author's hand.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> I<br> <br> I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state of mind I spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the golden sky. The scene had a greatness that made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it, made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise.<br> <br> I had no drop again till the next day, for I was carried triumphantly through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her. She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen, and I afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her. I slept little that night—I was too much excited; and this astonished me, too, I recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large, impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, as I almost felt it, the full, figured draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, I could see myself from head to foot, all struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should get on with Mrs. Grose in a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively on her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.<br> <br> But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a moment when I believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child; there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep. But these fancies were not marked enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me. To watch, teach, ‘form’ little Flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at night, her small white bed being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael's holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her, and to determine us—I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were naturally things that in Flora's presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and roundabout allusions.<br> <br> ‘And the little boy—does he look like her? Is he too so very remarkable?’<br> <br> One wouldn't flatter a child. ‘Oh, miss, MOST remarkable. If you think well of this one!’—and she stood there with a plate in her hand, beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.<br> <br> ‘Yes; if I do—?’<br> <br> ‘You WILL be carried away by the little gentleman!’<br> <br> ‘Well, that, I think, is what I came for—to be carried away. I'm afraid, however,’ I remember feeling the impulse to add, ‘I'm rather easily carried away. I was carried away in London!’<br> <br> I can still see Mrs. Grose's broad face as she took this in. ‘In Harley Street?’<br> <br> ‘In Harley Street.’<br> <br> ‘Well, miss, you're not the first—and you won't be the last.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, I've no pretension,’ I could laugh, ‘to being the only one. My other pupil, at any rate, as I understand, comes back tomorrow?’<br> <br> ‘Not tomorrow—Friday, miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.’<br> <br> I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge—never falsified, thank heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was glad I was there!<br> <br> What I felt the next day was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale, as I walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in, of my new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out-of-doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish talk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little tour, with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers and dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since the day I left it, and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairytales. Wasn't it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze and adream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older, half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm!<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> II<br> <br> This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply disconcerted me. The first day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. The postbag, that evening—it came late—contained a letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal still unbroken. ‘This, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the headmaster's an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him; but mind you don't report. Not a word. I'm off!’ I broke the seal with a great effort—so great a one that I was a long time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before going to bed. I had better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me a second sleepless night. With no counsel to take, the next day, I was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that I determined to open myself at least to Mrs. Grose.<br> <br> ‘What does it mean? The child's dismissed his school.’<br> <br> She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. ‘But aren't they all—?’<br> <br> ‘Sent home—yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at all.’<br> <br> Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. ‘They won't take him?’<br> <br> ‘They absolutely decline.’<br> <br> At this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; I saw them fill with good tears. ‘What has he done?’<br> <br> I hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand her my letter—which, however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put her hands behind her. She shook her head sadly. ‘Such things are not for me, miss.’<br> <br> My counselor couldn't read! I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated as I could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then, faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my pocket. ‘Is he really BAD?’<br> <br> The tears were still in her eyes. ‘Do the gentlemen say so?’<br> <br> ‘They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.’ Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went on: ‘That he's an injury to the others.’<br> <br> At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly flamed up. ‘Master Miles! HIM an injury?’<br> <br> There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea. I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot, sarcastically. ‘To his poor little innocent mates!’<br> <br> ‘It's too dreadful,’ cried Mrs. Grose, ‘to say such cruel things! Why, he's scarce ten years old.’<br> <br> ‘Yes, yes; it would be incredible.’<br> <br> She was evidently grateful for such a profession. ‘See him, miss, first. THEN believe it!’ I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. ‘You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her,’ she added the next moment—’LOOK at her!’<br> <br> I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of nice ‘round o's,’ now presented herself to view at the open door. She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of Mrs. Grose's comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.<br> <br> Nonetheless, the rest of the day I watched for further occasion to approach my colleague, especially as, toward evening, I began to fancy she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding her there with a hand on her arm. ‘I take what you said to me at noon as a declaration that YOU'VE never known him to be bad.’<br> <br> She threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very honestly, adopted an attitude. ‘Oh, never known him—I don't pretend THAT!’<br> <br> I was upset again. ‘Then you HAVE known him—?’<br> <br> ‘Yes indeed, miss, thank God!’<br> <br> On reflection I accepted this. ‘You mean that a boy who never is—?’<br> <br> ‘Is no boy for ME!’<br> <br> I held her tighter. ‘You like them with the spirit to be naughty?’ Then, keeping pace with her answer, ‘So do I!’ I eagerly brought out. ‘But not to the degree to contaminate—’<br> <br> ‘To contaminate?’—my big word left her at a loss. I explained it. ‘To corrupt.’<br> <br> She stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd laugh. ‘Are you afraid he'll corrupt YOU?’ She put the question with such a fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to match her own, I gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.<br> <br> But the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, I cropped up in another place. ‘What was the lady who was here before?’<br> <br> ‘The last governess? She was also young and pretty—almost as young and almost as pretty, miss, even as you.’<br> <br> ‘Ah, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!’ I recollect throwing off. ‘He seems to like us young and pretty!’<br> <br> ‘Oh, he DID,’ Mrs. Grose assented: ‘it was the way he liked everyone!’ She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. ‘I mean that's HIS way—the master's.’<br> <br> I was struck. ‘But of whom did you speak first?’<br> <br> She looked blank, but she colored. ‘Why, of HIM.’<br> <br> ‘Of the master?’<br> <br> ‘Of who else?’<br> <br> There was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I merely asked what I wanted to know. ‘Did SHE see anything in the boy—?’<br> <br> ‘That wasn't right? She never told me.’<br> <br> I had a scruple, but I overcame it. ‘Was she careful—particular?’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. ‘About some things—yes.’<br> <br> ‘But not about all?’<br> <br> Again she considered. ‘Well, miss—she's gone. I won't tell tales.’<br> <br> ‘I quite understand your feeling,’ I hastened to reply; but I thought it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: ‘Did she die here?’<br> <br> ‘No—she went off.’<br> <br> I don't know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose's that struck me as ambiguous. ‘Went off to die?’ Mrs. Grose looked straight out of the window, but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what young persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. ‘She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?’<br> <br> ‘She was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it, at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We had then a young woman—a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever; and SHE took the children altogether for the interval. But our young lady never came back, and at the very moment I was expecting her I heard from the master that she was dead.’<br> <br> I turned this over. ‘But of what?’<br> <br> ‘He never told me! But please, miss,’ said Mrs. Grose, ‘I must get to my work.’<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> III<br> <br> Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem. We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little late on the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered—so far, that is, as I was not outraged—by the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was grotesque.<br> <br> She promptly understood me. ‘You mean the cruel charge—?’<br> <br> ‘It doesn't live an instant. My dear woman, LOOK at him!’<br> <br> She smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm. ‘I assure you, miss, I do nothing else! What will you say, then?’ she immediately added.<br> <br> ‘In answer to the letter?’ I had made up my mind. ‘Nothing.’<br> <br> ‘And to his uncle?’<br> <br> I was incisive. ‘Nothing.’<br> <br> ‘And to the boy himself?’<br> <br> I was wonderful. ‘Nothing.’<br> <br> She gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. ‘Then I'll stand by you. We'll see it out.’<br> <br> ‘We'll see it out!’ I ardently echoed, giving her my hand to make it a vow.<br> <br> She held me there a moment, then whisked up her apron again with her detached hand. ‘Would you mind, miss, if I used the freedom—’<br> <br> ‘To kiss me? No!’ I took the good creature in my arms and, after we had embraced like sisters, felt still more fortified and indignant.<br> <br> This, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall the way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for weeks, the lessons must have been rather my own. I learned something—at first, certainly—that had not been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to speculate—but even this with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness—that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the spring of a beast.<br> <br> In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded—or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I COULD, after all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.<br> <br> It was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the children were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the thoughts that, as I don't in the least shrink now from noting, used to be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone. Someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. I didn't ask more than that—I only asked that he should KNOW; and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I mean the face was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot—and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for—was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did stand there!—but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little Flora had conducted me. This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated structures—that were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference, as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past. I admired them, had fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked seemed most in place.<br> <br> It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which, after these years, there is no living view that I can hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me was—a few more seconds assured me—as little anyone else I knew as it was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact of its appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement here with a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death. I can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky, and the friendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. But there was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with a stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame. That's how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder that in a few instants more became intense.<br> <br> The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard to certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in the house—and for how long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this visitant, at all events—and there was a touch of the strange freedom, as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat—seemed to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. So I saw him as I see the letters I form on this page; then, exactly, after a minute, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly changed his place—passed, looking at me hard all the while, to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from one of the crenelations to the next. He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me. He turned away; that was all I knew.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> IV<br> <br> It was not that I didn't wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a ‘secret’ at Bly—a mystery of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement? I can't say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes back to me in the general train—the impression, as I received it on my return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for a reason that I couldn't then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution—offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.<br> <br> Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day—or at least there were moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any ‘game.’ Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an intrusion; some unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and then stolen out as he came. If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The good thing, after all, was that we should surely see no more of him.<br> <br> This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom. I don't mean by this, of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it's a marvel for a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boy's conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a pang. Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My conclusion bloomed there with the real rose flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid, unclean school world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always, on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid headmasters—turn infallibly to the vindictive.<br> <br> Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never made Miles a muff) that kept them—how shall I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to whack! I remember feeling with Miles in especial as if he had had, as it were, no history. We expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have ‘caught’ it, and I should have caught it by the rebound—I should have found the trace. I found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school, never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I had more pains than one. I was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home, where things were not going well. But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their loveliness.<br> <br> There was a Sunday—to get on—when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence of which, as the day declined, I had arranged with Mrs. Grose that, should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which, through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of twenty minutes. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while I sat with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the ‘grown-up’ dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover them. The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. The person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won't say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met him, catch my breath and turn cold. He was the same—he was the same, and seen, this time, as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the window, though the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace on which he stood. His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds—long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been looking at him for years and had known him always. Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. On the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come for someone else.<br> <br> The flash of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief of this; but I took in the whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it time, but how long was it? I can't speak to the purpose today of the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they couldn't have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn't see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself where he had stood. I did so; I applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had looked, into the room. As if, at this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just before, came in from the hall. With this I had the full image of a repetition of what had already occurred. She saw me as I had seen my own visitant; she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I had received. She turned white, and this made me ask myself if I had blanched as much. She stared, in short, and retreated on just MY lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited I thought of more things than one. But there's only one I take space to mention. I wondered why SHE should be scared.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> V<br> <br> Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she loomed again into view. ‘What in the name of goodness is the matter—?’ She was now flushed and out of breath.<br> <br> I said nothing till she came quite near. ‘With me?’ I must have made a wonderful face. ‘Do I show it?’<br> <br> ‘You're as white as a sheet. You look awful.’<br> <br> I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My need to respect the bloom of Mrs. Grose's had dropped, without a rustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the instant it was not with what I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held her hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind of support in the shy heave of her surprise. ‘You came for me for church, of course, but I can't go.’<br> <br> ‘Has anything happened?’<br> <br> ‘Yes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?’<br> <br> ‘Through this window? Dreadful!’<br> <br> ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I've been frightened.’ Mrs. Grose's eyes expressed plainly that SHE had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience. Oh, it was quite settled that she MUST share! ‘Just what you saw from the dining room a minute ago was the effect of that. What I saw—just before—was much worse.’<br> <br> Her hand tightened. ‘What was it?’<br> <br> ‘An extraordinary man. Looking in.’<br> <br> ‘What extraordinary man?’<br> <br> ‘I haven't the least idea.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose gazed round us in vain. ‘Then where is he gone?’<br> <br> ‘I know still less.’<br> <br> ‘Have you seen him before?’<br> <br> ‘Yes—once. On the old tower.’<br> <br> She could only look at me harder. ‘Do you mean he's a stranger?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, very much!’<br> <br> ‘Yet you didn't tell me?’<br> <br> ‘No—for reasons. But now that you've guessed—’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose's round eyes encountered this charge. ‘Ah, I haven't guessed!’ she said very simply. ‘How can I if YOU don't imagine?’<br> <br> ‘I don't in the very least.’<br> <br> ‘You've seen him nowhere but on the tower?’<br> <br> ‘And on this spot just now.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose looked round again. ‘What was he doing on the tower?’<br> <br> ‘Only standing there and looking down at me.’<br> <br> She thought a minute. ‘Was he a gentleman?’<br> <br> I found I had no need to think. ‘No.’ She gazed in deeper wonder. ‘No.’<br> <br> ‘Then nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?’<br> <br> ‘Nobody—nobody. I didn't tell you, but I made sure.’<br> <br> She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It only went indeed a little way. ‘But if he isn't a gentleman—’<br> <br> ‘What IS he? He's a horror.’<br> <br> ‘A horror?’<br> <br> ‘He's—God help me if I know WHAT he is!’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt inconsequence. ‘It's time we should be at church.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, I'm not fit for church!’<br> <br> ‘Won't it do you good?’<br> <br> ‘It won't do THEM—! I nodded at the house.<br> <br> ‘The children?’<br> <br> ‘I can't leave them now.’<br> <br> ‘You're afraid—?’<br> <br> I spoke boldly. ‘I'm afraid of HIM.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose's large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made out in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that was as yet quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought instantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. ‘When was it—on the tower?’<br> <br> ‘About the middle of the month. At this same hour.’<br> <br> ‘Almost at dark,’ said Mrs. Grose.<br> <br> ‘Oh, no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.’<br> <br> ‘Then how did he get in?’<br> <br> ‘And how did he get out?’ I laughed. ‘I had no opportunity to ask him! This evening, you see,’ I pursued, ‘he has not been able to get in.’<br> <br> ‘He only peeps?’<br> <br> ‘I hope it will be confined to that!’ She had now let go my hand; she turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out: ‘Go to church. Goodbye. I must watch.’<br> <br> Slowly she faced me again. ‘Do you fear for them?’<br> <br> We met in another long look. ‘Don't YOU?’ Instead of answering she came nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass. ‘You see how he could see,’ I meanwhile went on.<br> <br> She didn't move. ‘How long was he here?’<br> <br> ‘Till I came out. I came to meet him.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her face. ‘I couldn't have come out.’<br> <br> ‘Neither could I!’ I laughed again. ‘But I did come. I have my duty.’<br> <br> ‘So have I mine,’ she replied; after which she added: ‘What is he like?’<br> <br> ‘I've been dying to tell you. But he's like nobody.’<br> <br> ‘Nobody?’ she echoed.<br> <br> ‘He has no hat.’ Then seeing in her face that she already, in this, with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke to stroke. ‘He has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a pale face, long in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange—awfully; but I only know clearly that they're rather small and very fixed. His mouth's wide, and his lips are thin, and except for his little whiskers he's quite clean-shaven. He gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.’<br> <br> ‘An actor!’ It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs. Grose at that moment.<br> <br> ‘I've never seen one, but so I suppose them. He's tall, active, erect,’ I continued, ‘but never—no, never!—a gentleman.’<br> <br> My companion's face had blanched as I went on; her round eyes started and her mild mouth gaped. ‘A gentleman?’ she gasped, confounded, stupefied: ‘a gentleman HE?’<br> <br> ‘You know him then?’<br> <br> She visibly tried to hold herself. ‘But he IS handsome?’<br> <br> I saw the way to help her. ‘Remarkably!’<br> <br> ‘And dressed—?’<br> <br> ‘In somebody's clothes.’ ‘They're smart, but they're not his own.’<br> <br> She broke into a breathless affirmative groan: ‘They're the master's!’<br> <br> I caught it up. ‘You DO know him?’<br> <br> She faltered but a second. ‘Quint!’ she cried.<br> <br> ‘Quint?’<br> <br> ‘Peter Quint—his own man, his valet, when he was here!’<br> <br> ‘When the master was?’<br> <br> Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. ‘He never wore his hat, but he did wear—well, there were waistcoats missed. They were both here—last year. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.’<br> <br> I followed, but halting a little. ‘Alone?’<br> <br> ‘Alone with US.’ Then, as from a deeper depth, ‘In charge,’ she added.<br> <br> ‘And what became of him?’<br> <br> She hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. ‘He went, too,’ she brought out at last.<br> <br> ‘Went where?’<br> <br> Her expression, at this, became extraordinary. ‘God knows where! He died.’<br> <br> ‘Died?’ I almost shrieked.<br> <br> She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to utter the wonder of it. ‘Yes. Mr. Quint is dead.’<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> VI<br> <br> It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified, and my companion's knowledge, henceforth—a knowledge half consternation and half compassion—of that liability. There had been, this evening, after the revelation left me, for an hour, so prostrate—there had been, for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have everything out. The result of our having everything out was simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the house but the governess was in the governess's plight; yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities.<br> <br> What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we thought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contract. I was queer company enough—quite as queer as the company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good fortune, COULD steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that led me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me. Perfectly can I recall now the particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every feature of what I had seen.<br> <br> ‘He was looking for someone else, you say—someone who was not you?’<br> <br> ‘He was looking for little Miles.’ A portentous clearness now possessed me. ‘THAT'S whom he was looking for.’<br> <br> ‘But how do you know?’<br> <br> ‘I know, I know, I know!’ My exaltation grew. ‘And YOU know, my dear!’<br> <br> She didn't deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling as that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: ‘What if HE should see him?’<br> <br> ‘Little Miles? That's what he wants!’<br> <br> She looked immensely scared again. ‘The child?’<br> <br> ‘Heaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to THEM.’ That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in practically proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see again what I had already seen, but something within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience, by accepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions. The children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I recall one of the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.<br> <br> ‘It does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned—’<br> <br> She looked at me hard as I musingly pulled up. ‘His having been here and the time they were with him?’<br> <br> ‘The time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history, in any way.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, the little lady doesn't remember. She never heard or knew.’<br> <br> ‘The circumstances of his death?’ I thought with some intensity. ‘Perhaps not. But Miles would remember—Miles would know.’<br> <br> ‘Ah, don't try him!’ broke from Mrs. Grose.<br> <br> I returned her the look she had given me. ‘Don't be afraid.’ I continued to think. ‘It IS rather odd.’<br> <br> ‘That he has never spoken of him?’<br> <br> ‘Never by the least allusion. And you tell me they were 'great friends'?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, it wasn't HIM!’ Mrs. Grose with emphasis declared. ‘It was Quint's own fancy. To play with him, I mean—to spoil him.’ She paused a moment; then she added: ‘Quint was much too free.’<br> <br> This gave me, straight from my vision of his face—SUCH a face!—a sudden sickness of disgust. ‘Too free with MY boy?’<br> <br> ‘Too free with everyone!’<br> <br> I forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of the household, of the half-dozen maids and men who were still of our small colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the lucky fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation of scullions, had ever, within anyone's memory attached to the kind old place. It had neither bad name nor ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most apparently, only desired to cling to me and to quake in silence. I even put her, the very last thing of all, to the test. It was when, at midnight, she had her hand on the schoolroom door to take leave. ‘I have it from you then—for it's of great importance—that he was definitely and admittedly bad?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, not admittedly. I knew it—but the master didn't.’<br> <br> ‘And you never told him?’<br> <br> ‘Well, he didn't like tale-bearing—he hated complaints. He was terribly short with anything of that kind, and if people were all right to HIM—’<br> <br> ‘He wouldn't be bothered with more?’ This squared well enough with my impressions of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very particular perhaps about some of the company HE kept. All the same, I pressed my interlocutress. ‘I promise you I would have told!’<br> <br> She felt my discrimination. ‘I daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.’<br> <br> ‘Afraid of what?’<br> <br> ‘Of things that man could do. Quint was so clever—he was so deep.’<br> <br> I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. ‘You weren't afraid of anything else? Not of his effect—?’<br> <br> ‘His effect?’ she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while I faltered.<br> <br> ‘On innocent little precious lives. They were in your charge.’<br> <br> ‘No, they were not in mine!’ she roundly and distressfully returned. ‘The master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed not to be well and the country air so good for him. So he had everything to say. Yes’—she let me have it—’even about THEM.’<br> <br> ‘Them—that creature?’ I had to smother a kind of howl. ‘And you could bear it!’<br> <br> ‘No. I couldn't—and I can't now!’ And the poor woman burst into tears.<br> <br> A rigid control, from the next day, was, as I have said, to follow them; yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back together to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that Sunday night, I was, in the immediate later hours in especial—for it may be imagined whether I slept—still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me. I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word Mrs. Grose had kept back. I was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was not from a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. It seems to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow's sun was high I had restlessly read into the fact before us almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more cruel occurrences. What they gave me above all was just the sinister figure of the living man—the dead one would keep awhile!—and of the months he had continuously passed at Bly, which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The limit of this evil time had arrived only when, on the dawn of a winter's morning, Peter Quint was found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road from the village: a catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound to his head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final evidence, HAD been—by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been matters in his life—strange passages and perils, secret disorders, vices more than suspected—that would have accounted for a good deal more.<br> <br> I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture of my state of mind; but I was in these days literally able to find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of me. I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen—oh, in the right quarter!—that I could succeed where many another girl might have failed. It was an immense help to me—I confess I rather applaud myself as I look back!—that I saw my service so strongly and so simply. I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one's own committed heart. We were cut off, really, together; we were united in our danger. They had nothing but me, and I—well, I had THEM. It was in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me in an image richly material. I was a screen—I was to stand before them. The more I saw, the less they would. I began to watch them in a stifled suspense, a disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too long, have turned to something like madness. What saved me, as I now see, was that it turned to something else altogether. It didn't last as suspense—it was superseded by horrible proofs. Proofs, I say, yes—from the moment I really took hold.<br> <br> This moment dated from an afternoon hour that I happened to spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wished to finish a book, and I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with her half an hour, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the day exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived—it was the charming thing in both children—to let me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer. I walked in a world of their invention—they had no occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the lake was the Sea of Azof.<br> <br> Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world—the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work—for I was something or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet without direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third person. The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour. There was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one moment to another found myself forming as to what I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of raising my eyes. They were attached at this juncture to the stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my effort not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able to make up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view—a figure whose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I recollect counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one of the men about the place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman's boy, from the village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I was conscious—still even without looking—of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were not.<br> <br> Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I transferred my eyes straight to little Flora, who, at the moment, was about ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I held my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. I waited, but nothing came; then, in the first place—and there is something more dire in this, I feel, than in anything I have to relate—I was determined by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds from her had previously dropped; and, in the second, by the circumstance that, also within the minute, she had, in her play, turned her back to the water. This was her attitude when I at last looked at her—looked with the confirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct personal notice. She had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a mast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, as I watched her, she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place. My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some seconds I felt I was ready for more. Then I again shifted my eyes—I faced what I had to face.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> VII<br> <br> I got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can give no intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still hear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into her arms: ‘They KNOW—it's too monstrous: they know, they know!’<br> <br> ‘And what on earth—?’ I felt her incredulity as she held me.<br> <br> ‘Why, all that WE know—and heaven knows what else besides!’ Then, as she released me, I made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now with full coherency even to myself. ‘Two hours ago, in the garden’—I could scarce articulate—’Flora SAW!’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. ‘She has told you?’ she panted.<br> <br> ‘Not a word—that's the horror. She kept it to herself! The child of eight, THAT child!’ Unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction of it.<br> <br> Mrs. Grose, of course, could only gape the wider. ‘Then how do you know?’<br> <br> ‘I was there—I saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.’<br> <br> ‘Do you mean aware of HIM?’<br> <br> ‘No—of HER.’ I was conscious as I spoke that I looked prodigious things, for I got the slow reflection of them in my companion's face. ‘Another person—this time; but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror and evil: a woman in black, pale and dreadful—with such an air also, and such a face!—on the other side of the lake. I was there with the child—quiet for the hour; and in the midst of it she came.’<br> <br> ‘Came how—from where?’<br> <br> ‘From where they come from! She just appeared and stood there—but not so near.’<br> <br> ‘And without coming nearer?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as you!’<br> <br> My friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. ‘Was she someone you've never seen?’<br> <br> ‘Yes. But someone the child has. Someone YOU have.’ Then, to show how I had thought it all out: ‘My predecessor—the one who died.’<br> <br> ‘Miss Jessel?’<br> <br> ‘Miss Jessel. You don't believe me?’ I pressed.<br> <br> She turned right and left in her distress. ‘How can you be sure?’<br> <br> This drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience. ‘Then ask Flora—SHE'S sure!’ But I had no sooner spoken than I caught myself up. ‘No, for God's sake, DON'T! She'll say she isn't—she'll lie!’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. ‘Ah, how CAN you?’<br> <br> ‘Because I'm clear. Flora doesn't want me to know.’<br> <br> ‘It's only then to spare you.’<br> <br> ‘No, no—there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see in it, and the more I see in it, the more I fear. I don't know what I DON'T see—what I DON'T fear!’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose tried to keep up with me. ‘You mean you're afraid of seeing her again?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, no; that's nothing—now!’ Then I explained. ‘It's of NOT seeing her.’<br> <br> But my companion only looked wan. ‘I don't understand you.’<br> <br> ‘Why, it's that the child may keep it up—and that the child assuredly WILL—without my knowing it.’<br> <br> At the image of this possibility Mrs. Grose for a moment collapsed, yet presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to give way to. ‘Dear, dear—we must keep our heads! And after all, if she doesn't mind it—!’ She even tried a grim joke. ‘Perhaps she likes it!’<br> <br> ‘Likes SUCH things—a scrap of an infant!’<br> <br> ‘Isn't it just a proof of her blessed innocence?’ my friend bravely inquired.<br> <br> She brought me, for the instant, almost round. ‘Oh, we must clutch at THAT—we must cling to it! If it isn't a proof of what you say, it's a proof of—God knows what! For the woman's a horror of horrors.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on the ground; then at last raising them, ‘Tell me how you know,’ she said.<br> <br> ‘Then you admit it's what she was?’ I cried.<br> <br> ‘Tell me how you know,’ my friend simply repeated.<br> <br> ‘Know? By seeing her! By the way she looked.’<br> <br> ‘At you, do you mean—so wickedly?’<br> <br> ‘Dear me, no—I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She only fixed the child.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose tried to see it. ‘Fixed her?’<br> <br> ‘Ah, with such awful eyes!’<br> <br> She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. ‘Do you mean of dislike?’<br> <br> ‘God help us, no. Of something much worse.’<br> <br> ‘Worse than dislike?—this left her indeed at a loss.<br> <br> ‘With a determination—indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.’<br> <br> I made her turn pale. ‘Intention?’<br> <br> ‘To get hold of her.’ Mrs. Grose—her eyes just lingering on mine—gave a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking out I completed my statement. ‘THAT'S what Flora knows.’<br> <br> After a little she turned round. ‘The person was in black, you say?’<br> <br> ‘In mourning—rather poor, almost shabby. But—yes—with extraordinary beauty.’ I now recognized to what I had at last, stroke by stroke, brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed this. ‘Oh, handsome—very, very,’ I insisted; ‘wonderfully handsome. But infamous.’<br> <br> She slowly came back to me. ‘Miss Jessel—WAS infamous.’ She once more took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me against the increase of alarm I might draw from this disclosure. ‘They were both infamous,’ she finally said.<br> <br> So, for a little, we faced it once more together; and I found absolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. ‘I appreciate,’ I said, ‘the great decency of your not having hitherto spoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.’ She appeared to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which I went on: ‘I must have it now. Of what did she die? Come, there was something between them.’<br> <br> ‘There was everything.’<br> <br> ‘In spite of the difference—?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, of their rank, their condition’—she brought it woefully out. ‘SHE was a lady.’<br> <br> I turned it over; I again saw. ‘Yes—she was a lady.’<br> <br> ‘And he so dreadfully below,’ said Mrs. Grose.<br> <br> I felt that I doubtless needn't press too hard, in such company, on the place of a servant in the scale; but there was nothing to prevent an acceptance of my companion's own measure of my predecessor's abasement. There was a way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more readily for my full vision—on the evidence—of our employer's late clever, good-looking ‘own’ man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. ‘The fellow was a hound.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense of shades. ‘I've never seen one like him. He did what he wished.’<br> <br> ‘With HER?’<br> <br> ‘With them all.’<br> <br> It was as if now in my friend's own eyes Miss Jessel had again appeared. I seemed at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation of her as distinctly as I had seen her by the pond; and I brought out with decision: ‘It must have been also what SHE wished!’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose's face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at the same time: ‘Poor woman—she paid for it!’<br> <br> ‘Then you do know what she died of?’ I asked.<br> <br> ‘No—I know nothing. I wanted not to know; I was glad enough I didn't; and I thanked heaven she was well out of this!’<br> <br> ‘Yet you had, then, your idea—’<br> <br> ‘Of her real reason for leaving? Oh, yes—as to that. She couldn't have stayed. Fancy it here—for a governess! And afterward I imagined—and I still imagine. And what I imagine is dreadful.’<br> <br> ‘Not so dreadful as what I do,’ I replied; on which I must have shown her—as I was indeed but too conscious—a front of miserable defeat. It brought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renewed touch of her kindness my power to resist broke down. I burst, as I had, the other time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly breast, and my lamentation overflowed. ‘I don't do it!’ I sobbed in despair; ‘I don't save or shield them! It's far worse than I dreamed—they're lost!’<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> VIII<br> <br> What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I had ‘made it up,’ I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished of course—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it. I encountered her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence—for recurrence we took for granted—I should get used to my danger, distinctly professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hours of the day had brought a little ease.<br> <br> On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively cultivate and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other words, plunged afresh into Flora's special society and there become aware—it was almost a luxury!—that she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having ‘cried.’ I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally—for the time, at all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the depths of blue of the child's eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn't abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs. Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small hours—that with their voices in the air, their pressure on one's heart, and their fragrant faces against one's cheek, everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that, somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter, for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn't, and at the same time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did! It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp.<br> <br> Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review, I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my friend that I was certain—which was so much to the good—that I at least had not betrayed myself. I should not have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind—I scarce know what to call it—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain. ‘I don't believe anything so horrible,’ I recollect saying; ‘no, let us put it definitely, my dear, that I don't. But if I did, you know, there's a thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you. What was it you had in mind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, over the letter from his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn't pretend for him that he had not literally EVER been 'bad'? He has NOT literally 'ever,' in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to take. What was your exception, and to what passage in your personal observation of him did you refer?’<br> <br> It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and, at any rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got my answer. What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the purpose. It was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a period of several months Quint and the boy had been perpetually together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had ventured to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank overture to Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner, requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this, directly approached little Miles. What she had said to him, since I pressed, was that SHE liked to see young gentlemen not forget their station.<br> <br> I pressed again, of course, at this. ‘You reminded him that Quint was only a base menial?’<br> <br> ‘As you might say! And it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.’<br> <br> ‘And for another thing?’ I waited. ‘He repeated your words to Quint?’<br> <br> ‘No, not that. It's just what he WOULDN'T!’ she could still impress upon me. ‘I was sure, at any rate,’ she added, ‘that he didn't. But he denied certain occasions.’<br> <br> ‘What occasions?’<br> <br> ‘When they had been about together quite as if Quint were his tutor—and a very grand one—and Miss Jessel only for the little lady. When he had gone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent hours with him.’<br> <br> ‘He then prevaricated about it—he said he hadn't?’ Her assent was clear enough to cause me to add in a moment: ‘I see. He lied.’<br> <br> ‘Oh!’ Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it didn't matter; which indeed she backed up by a further remark. ‘You see, after all, Miss Jessel didn't mind. She didn't forbid him.’<br> <br> I considered. ‘Did he put that to you as a justification?’<br> <br> At this she dropped again. ‘No, he never spoke of it.’<br> <br> ‘Never mentioned her in connection with Quint?’<br> <br> She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. ‘Well, he didn't show anything. He denied,’ she repeated; ‘he denied.’<br> <br> Lord, how I pressed her now! ‘So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?’<br> <br> ‘I don't know—I don't know!’ the poor woman groaned.<br> <br> ‘You do know, you dear thing,’ I replied; ‘only you haven't my dreadful boldness of mind, and you keep back, out of timidity and modesty and delicacy, even the impression that, in the past, when you had, without my aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you miserable. But I shall get it out of you yet! There was something in the boy that suggested to you,’ I continued, ‘that he covered and concealed their relation.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, he couldn't prevent—’<br> <br> ‘Your learning the truth? I daresay! But, heavens,’ I fell, with vehemence, athinking, ‘what it shows that they must, to that extent, have succeeded in making of him!’<br> <br> ‘Ah, nothing that's not nice NOW!’ Mrs. Grose lugubriously pleaded.<br> <br> ‘I don't wonder you looked queer,’ I persisted, ‘when I mentioned to you the letter from his school!’<br> <br> ‘I doubt if I looked as queer as you!’ she retorted with homely force. ‘And if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel now?’<br> <br> ‘Yes, indeed—and if he was a fiend at school! How, how, how? Well,’ I said in my torment, ‘you must put it to me again, but I shall not be able to tell you for some days. Only, put it to me again!’ I cried in a way that made my friend stare. ‘There are directions in which I must not for the present let myself go.’ Meanwhile I returned to her first example—the one to which she had just previously referred—of the boy's happy capacity for an occasional slip. ‘If Quint—on your remonstrance at the time you speak of—was a base menial, one of the things Miles said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you were another.’ Again her admission was so adequate that I continued: ‘And you forgave him that?’<br> <br> ‘Wouldn't YOU?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, yes!’ And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the oddest amusement. Then I went on: ‘At all events, while he was with the man—’<br> <br> ‘Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them all!’<br> <br> It suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression of this view that I will throw, just here, no further light on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to Mrs. Grose. ‘His having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of the little natural man. Still,’ I mused, ‘They must do, for they make me feel more than ever that I must watch.’<br> <br> It made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friend's face how much more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing. This came out when, at the schoolroom door, she quitted me. ‘Surely you don't accuse HIM—’<br> <br> ‘Of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember that, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody.’ Then, before shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own place, ‘I must just wait,’ I wound up.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> IX<br> <br> I waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from my consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark. I trembled lest they should see that they WERE so immensely more interesting. Putting things at the worst, at all events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart. As soon as I had done so I used to say to myself: ‘What will they think of that? Doesn't it betray too much?’ It would have been easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, so too I remember wondering if I mightn't see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations.<br> <br> They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a purpose in it. They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons better and better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the ‘pieces’ they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I should never get to the bottom—were I to let myself go even now—of the prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with which, in these days, I overscored their full hours. They had shown me from the first a facility for everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for Miles. What I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson's daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that he was under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement.<br> <br> If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone school, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been ‘kicked out’ by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me add that in their company now—and I was careful almost never to be out of it—I could follow no scent very far. We lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest, but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of catching and repeating. The schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to ‘come in’ as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away. There is a naive side, I suppose, in all diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced upon me, it was surely with the minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull, the grossness broke out.<br> <br> I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on with the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge the most liberal faith—for which I little care; but—and this is another matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance. One evening—with nothing to lead up or to prepare it—I felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly—last-century fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand was Fielding's Amelia; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to looking at my watch. I figure, finally, that the white curtain draping, in the fashion of those days, the head of Flora's little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though I was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered, looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room. There was a moment during which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door.<br> <br> I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant, I saw that there was someone on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden. He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn't meet and measure him.<br> <br> I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had, thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease—for the time, at least—to have him to reckon with; and during the minute, accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous just because it WAS human, as human as to have met alone, in the small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer, some criminal. It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such an hour, we still at least would have spoken. Something would have passed, in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved. The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt if even I were in life. I can't express what followed it save by saying that the silence itself—which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my strength—became the element into which I saw the figure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was lost.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> X<br> <br> I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora's little bed was empty; and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: I perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it. She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink bare feet and the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave, and I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach. ‘You naughty: where HAVE you been?’—instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep. I remember closing my eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. ‘You were looking for me out of the window?’ I said. ‘You thought I might be walking in the grounds?’<br> <br> ‘Well, you know, I thought someone was’—she never blanched as she smiled out that at me.<br> <br> Oh, how I looked at her now! ‘And did you see anyone?’<br> <br> ‘Ah, NO!’ she returned, almost with the full privilege of childish inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her little drawl of the negative.<br> <br> At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she lied; and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which I might take this up. One of these, for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that, to withstand it, I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully, she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. Why not break out at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her straight in her lovely little lighted face? ‘You see, you see, you KNOW that you do and that you already quite suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our fate, where we are and what it means?’ This solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could immediately have succumbed to it I might have spared myself—well, you'll see what. Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my feet, looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way. ‘Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?’<br> <br> Flora luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile: ‘Because I don't like to frighten you!’<br> <br> ‘But if I had, by your idea, gone out—?’<br> <br> She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. ‘Oh, but you know,’ she quite adequately answered, ‘that you might come back, you dear, and that you HAVE!’ And after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a long time, by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to prove that I recognized the pertinence of my return.<br> <br> You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of my nights. I repeatedly sat up till I didn't know when; I selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept, and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as far as to where I had last met Quint. But I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I on no other occasion saw him in the house. I just missed, on the staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. Looking down it from the top I once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back presented to me, her body half-bowed and her head, in an attitude of woe, in her hands. I had been there but an instant, however, when she vanished without looking round at me. I knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face she had to show; and I wondered whether, if instead of being above I had been below, I should have had, for going up, the same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well, there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my latest encounter with that gentleman—they were all numbered now—I had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching, I had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at my old hour. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about one o'clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused as if a hand had shook me. I had left a light burning, but it was now out, and I felt an instant certainty that Flora had extinguished it. This brought me to my feet and straight, in the darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. A glance at the window enlightened me further, and the striking of a match completed the picture.<br> <br> The child had again got up—this time blowing out the taper, and had again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the night. That she now saw—as she had not, I had satisfied myself, the previous time—was proved to me by the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap. Hidden, protected, absorbed, she evidently rested on the sill—the casement opened forward—and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to help her, and this fact had counted in my quick decision. She was face to face with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate with it as she had not then been able to do. What I, on my side, had to care for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some other window in the same quarter. I got to the door without her hearing me; I got out of it, closed it, and listened, from the other side, for some sound from her. While I stood in the passage I had my eyes on her brother's door, which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably, produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of as my temptation. What if I should go straight in and march to HIS window?—what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my boldness?<br> <br> This thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were secretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which my impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds—a figure prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. I hesitated afresh, but on other grounds and only for a few seconds; then I had made my choice. There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing the right one. The right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one—though high above the gardens—in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by Mrs. Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt as quietly as I could one of the shutters. Achieving this transit, I uncovered the glass without a sound and, applying my face to the pane, was able, the darkness without being much less than within, to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more. The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared—looking, that is, not so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. There was clearly another person above me—there was a person on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had conceived and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn—I felt sick as I made it out—was poor little Miles himself.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XI<br> <br> It was not till late next day that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; the rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not provoking—on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries. I drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences. She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn't I don't know what would have become of me, for I couldn't have borne the business alone. But she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her, when she surveyed them, with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her look, thank the Lord's mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a steady fireside glow, and I had already begun to perceive how, with the development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers.<br> <br> At the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in one of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry. I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority—my accomplishments and my function—in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch's broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan. This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.<br> <br> Not a sound, on the way, had passed between us, and I had wondered—oh, HOW I had wondered!—if he were groping about in his little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque. It would tax his invention, certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real embarrassment, a curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the inscrutable! He couldn't play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce I should. I was confronted at last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note. I remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber, where the bed had not been slept in at all and the window, uncovered to the moonlight, made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match—I remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, ‘had’ me. He could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He ‘had’ me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture, I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration. I was of course thoroughly kind and merciful; never, never yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held him there well under fire. I had no alternative but, in form at least, to put it to him.<br> <br> ‘You must tell me now—and all the truth. What did you go out for? What were you doing there?’<br> <br> I can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes, and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. ‘If I tell you why, will you understand?’ My heart, at this, leaped into my mouth. WOULD he tell me why? I found no sound on my lips to press it, and I was aware of replying only with a vague, repeated, grimacing nod. He was gentleness itself, and while I wagged my head at him he stood there more than ever a little fairy prince. It was his brightness indeed that gave me a respite. Would it be so great if he were really going to tell me? ‘Well,’ he said at last, ‘just exactly in order that you should do this.’<br> <br> ‘Do what?’<br> <br> ‘Think me—for a change—BAD!’ I shall never forget the sweetness and gaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how, on top of it, he bent forward and kissed me. It was practically the end of everything. I met his kiss and I had to make, while I folded him for a minute in my arms, the most stupendous effort not to cry. He had given exactly the account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it, and it was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that, as I presently glanced about the room, I could say—<br> <br> ‘Then you didn't undress at all?’<br> <br> He fairly glittered in the gloom. ‘Not at all. I sat up and read.’<br> <br> ‘And when did you go down?’<br> <br> ‘At midnight. When I'm bad I AM bad!’<br> <br> ‘I see, I see—it's charming. But how could you be sure I would know it?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, I arranged that with Flora.’ His answers rang out with a readiness! ‘She was to get up and look out.’<br> <br> ‘Which is what she did do.’ It was I who fell into the trap!<br> <br> ‘So she disturbed you, and, to see what she was looking at, you also looked—you saw.’<br> <br> ‘While you,’ I concurred, ‘caught your death in the night air!’<br> <br> He literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford radiantly to assent. ‘How otherwise should I have been bad enough?’ he asked. Then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview closed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that, for his joke, he had been able to draw upon.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XII<br> <br> The particular impression I had received proved in the morning light, I repeat, not quite successfully presentable to Mrs. Grose, though I reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made before we separated. ‘It all lies in half a dozen words,’ I said to her, ‘words that really settle the matter. 'Think, you know, what I MIGHT do!' He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows down to the ground what he 'might' do. That's what he gave them a taste of at school.’<br> <br> ‘Lord, you do change!’ cried my friend.<br> <br> ‘I don't change—I simply make it out. The four, depend upon it, perpetually meet. If on either of these last nights you had been with either child, you would clearly have understood. The more I've watched and waited the more I've felt that if there were nothing else to make it sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each. NEVER, by a slip of the tongue, have they so much as alluded to either of their old friends, any more than Miles has alluded to his expulsion. Oh, yes, we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us there to their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in their fairytale they're steeped in their vision of the dead restored. He's not reading to her,’ I declared; ‘they're talking of THEM—they're talking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I were crazy; and it's a wonder I'm not. What I've seen would have made YOU so; but it has only made me more lucid, made me get hold of still other things.’<br> <br> My lucidity must have seemed awful, but the charming creatures who were victims of it, passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness, gave my colleague something to hold on by; and I felt how tight she held as, without stirring in the breath of my passion, she covered them still with her eyes. ‘Of what other things have you got hold?’<br> <br> ‘Why, of the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet, at bottom, as I now so strangely see, mystified and troubled me. Their more than earthly beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. It's a game,’ I went on; ‘it's a policy and a fraud!’<br> <br> ‘On the part of little darlings—?’<br> <br> ‘As yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as that seems!’ The very act of bringing it out really helped me to trace it—follow it all up and piece it all together. ‘They haven't been good—they've only been absent. It has been easy to live with them, because they're simply leading a life of their own. They're not mine—they're not ours. They're his and they're hers!’<br> <br> ‘Quint's and that woman's?’<br> <br> ‘Quint's and that woman's. They want to get to them.’<br> <br> Oh, how, at this, poor Mrs. Grose appeared to study them! ‘But for what?’<br> <br> ‘For the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair put into them. And to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the work of demons, is what brings the others back.’<br> <br> ‘Laws!’ said my friend under her breath. The exclamation was homely, but it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the bad time—for there had been a worse even than this!—must have occurred. There could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent of her experience to whatever depth of depravity I found credible in our brace of scoundrels. It was in obvious submission of memory that she brought out after a moment: ‘They WERE rascals! But what can they now do?’ she pursued.<br> <br> ‘Do?’ I echoed so loud that Miles and Flora, as they passed at their distance, paused an instant in their walk and looked at us. ‘Don't they do enough?’ I demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition. We were held by it a minute; then I answered: ‘They can destroy them!’ At this my companion did turn, but the inquiry she launched was a silent one, the effect of which was to make me more explicit. ‘They don't know, as yet, quite how—but they're trying hard. They're seen only across, as it were, and beyond—in strange places and on high places, the top of towers, the roof of houses, the outside of windows, the further edge of pools; but there's a deep design, on either side, to shorten the distance and overcome the obstacle; and the success of the tempters is only a question of time. They've only to keep to their suggestions of danger.’<br> <br> ‘For the children to come?’<br> <br> ‘And perish in the attempt!’ Mrs. Grose slowly got up, and I scrupulously added: ‘Unless, of course, we can prevent!’<br> <br> Standing there before me while I kept my seat, she visibly turned things over. ‘Their uncle must do the preventing. He must take them away.’<br> <br> ‘And who's to make him?’<br> <br> She had been scanning the distance, but she now dropped on me a foolish face. ‘You, miss.’<br> <br> ‘By writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and niece mad?’<br> <br> ‘But if they ARE, miss?’<br> <br> ‘And if I am myself, you mean? That's charming news to be sent him by a governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose considered, following the children again. ‘Yes, he do hate worry. That was the great reason—’<br> <br> ‘Why those fiends took him in so long? No doubt, though his indifference must have been awful. As I'm not a fiend, at any rate, I shouldn't take him in.’<br> <br> My companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and grasped my arm. ‘Make him at any rate come to you.’<br> <br> I stared. ‘To ME?’ I had a sudden fear of what she might do. ‘'Him'?’<br> <br> ‘He ought to BE here—he ought to help.’<br> <br> I quickly rose, and I think I must have shown her a queerer face than ever yet. ‘You see me asking him for a visit?’ No, with her eyes on my face she evidently couldn't. Instead of it even—as a woman reads another—she could see what I myself saw: his derision, his amusement, his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone and for the fine machinery I had set in motion to attract his attention to my slighted charms. She didn't know—no one knew—how proud I had been to serve him and to stick to our terms; yet she nonetheless took the measure, I think, of the warning I now gave her. ‘If you should so lose your head as to appeal to him for me—’<br> <br> She was really frightened. ‘Yes, miss?’<br> <br> ‘I would leave, on the spot, both him and you.’<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XIII<br> <br> It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as much as ever an effort beyond my strength—offered, in close quarters, difficulties as insurmountable as before. This situation continued a month, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note above all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the part of my pupils. It was not, I am as sure today as I was sure then, my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don't mean that they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement. It was as if, at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before which we must stop short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we perceived to be blind, closing with a little bang that made us look at each other—for, like all bangs, it was something louder than we had intended—the doors we had indiscreetly opened. All roads lead to Rome, and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground. Forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends little children had lost. There were days when I could have sworn that one of them had, with a small invisible nudge, said to the other: ‘She thinks she'll do it this time—but she WON'T!’ To ‘do it’ would have been to indulge for instance—and for once in a way—in some direct reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home, as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old women of our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round. They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my memory; and nothing else perhaps, when I thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being watched from under cover. It was in any case over MY life, MY past, and MY friends alone that we could take anything like our ease—a state of affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders. I was invited—with no visible connection—to repeat afresh Goody Gosling's celebrated mot or to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the vicarage pony.<br> <br> It was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different ones that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I have called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for me without another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have done something toward soothing my nerves. Since the light brush, that second night on the upper landing, of the presence of a woman at the foot of the stair, I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house, that one had better not have seen. There was many a corner round which I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way, would have favored the appearance of Miss Jessel. The summer had turned, the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon Bly and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its gray sky and withered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly states of the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of the KIND of ministering moment, that brought back to me, long enough to catch it, the feeling of the medium in which, that June evening out of doors, I had had my first sight of Quint, and in which, too, at those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the window, looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery. I recognized the signs, the portents—I recognized the moment, the spot. But they remained unaccompanied and empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young woman whose sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined but deepened. I had said in my talk with Mrs. Grose on that horrid scene of Flora's by the lake—and had perplexed her by so saying—that it would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to keep it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that, whether the children really saw or not—since, that is, it was not yet definitely proved—I greatly preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. I was ready to know the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of was that my eyes might be sealed just while theirs were most opened. Well, my eyes WERE sealed, it appeared, at present—a consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There was, alas, a difficulty about that: I would have thanked him with all my soul had I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my pupils.<br> <br> How can I retrace today the strange steps of my obsession? There were times of our being together when I would have been ready to swear that, literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of it closed, they had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was that, had I not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might prove greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken out. ‘They're here, they're here, you little wretches,’ I would have cried, ‘and you can't deny it now!’ The little wretches denied it with all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths of which—like the flash of a fish in a stream—the mockery of their advantage peeped up. The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night when, looking out to see either Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars, I had beheld the boy over whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him—had straightway, there, turned it on me—the lovely upward look with which, from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had played. If it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments, I shut myself up audibly to rehearse—it was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despair—the manner in which I might come to the point. I approached it from one side and the other while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself that I should indeed help them to represent something infamous, if, by pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive delicacy as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When I said to myself: ‘THEY have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness to speak!’ I felt myself crimson and I covered my face with my hands. After these secret scenes I chattered more than ever, going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable hushes occurred—I can call them nothing else—the strange, dizzy lift or swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano. Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they were not angels, they ‘passed,’ as the French say, causing me, while they stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough for myself.<br> <br> What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that, whatever I had seen, Miles and Flora saw MORE—things terrible and unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in the past. Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same movements. It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril. ‘When do you think he WILL come? Don't you think we OUGHT to write?’—there was nothing like that inquiry, we found by experience, for carrying off an awkwardness. ‘He’ of course was their uncle in Harley Street; and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to have given less encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not had the doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our finest exhibitions. He never wrote to them—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the pledge given not to appeal to him when I let my charges understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises. They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them all to this hour. This was a rule indeed which only added to the satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more awkward than anything else that might be for me. There appears to me, moreover, as I look back, no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact that, in spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost patience with them. Adorable they must in truth have been, I now reflect, that I didn't in these days hate them! Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little matters, for relief arrived. I call it relief, though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at least change, and it came with a rush.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XIV<br> <br> Walking to church a certain Sunday morning, I had little Miles at my side and his sister, in advance of us and at Mrs. Grose's, well in sight. It was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time; the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright and sharp, made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? Something or other had brought nearer home to me that I had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, in the way our companions were marshaled before me, I might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion. I was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes. But all this belonged—I mean their magnificent little surrender—just to the special array of the facts that were most abysmal. Turned out for Sunday by his uncle's tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, Miles's whole title to independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing to say. I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet him when the revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution because I now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was precipitated. ‘Look here, my dear, you know,’ he charmingly said, ‘when in the world, please, am I going back to school?’<br> <br> Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly as uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off intonations as if he were tossing roses. There was something in them that always made one ‘catch,’ and I caught, at any rate, now so effectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the road. There was something new, on the spot, between us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognized it, though, to enable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and charming than usual. I could feel in him how he already, from my at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage he had gained. I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after a minute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: ‘You know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady ALWAYS—!’ His ‘my dear’ was constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have expressed more the exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to inspire my pupils than its fond familiarity. It was so respectfully easy.<br> <br> But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I remember that, to gain time, I tried to laugh, and I seemed to see in the beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly and queer I looked. ‘And always with the same lady?’ I returned.<br> <br> He neither blanched nor winked. The whole thing was virtually out between us. ‘Ah, of course, she's a jolly, 'perfect' lady; but, after all, I'm a fellow, don't you see? that's—well, getting on.’<br> <br> I lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. ‘Yes, you're getting on.’ Oh, but I felt helpless!<br> <br> I have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed to know that and to play with it. ‘And you can't say I've not been awfully good, can you?’<br> <br> I laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though I felt how much better it would have been to walk on, I was not yet quite able. ‘No, I can't say that, Miles.’<br> <br> ‘Except just that one night, you know—!’<br> <br> ‘That one night?’ I couldn't look as straight as he.<br> <br> ‘Why, when I went down—went out of the house.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.’<br> <br> ‘You forget?’—he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish reproach. ‘Why, it was to show you I could!’<br> <br> ‘Oh, yes, you could.’<br> <br> ‘And I can again.’<br> <br> I felt that I might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wits about me. ‘Certainly. But you won't.’<br> <br> ‘No, not THAT again. It was nothing.’<br> <br> ‘It was nothing,’ I said. ‘But we must go on.’<br> <br> He resumed our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. ‘Then when AM I going back?’<br> <br> I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. ‘Were you very happy at school?’<br> <br> He just considered. ‘Oh, I'm happy enough anywhere!’<br> <br> ‘Well, then,’ I quavered, ‘if you're just as happy here—!’<br> <br> ‘Ah, but that isn't everything! Of course YOU know a lot—’<br> <br> ‘But you hint that you know almost as much?’ I risked as he paused.<br> <br> ‘Not half I want to!’ Miles honestly professed. ‘But it isn't so much that.’<br> <br> ‘What is it, then?’<br> <br> ‘Well—I want to see more life.’<br> <br> ‘I see; I see.’ We had arrived within sight of the church and of various persons, including several of the household of Bly, on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in. I quickened our step; I wanted to get there before the question between us opened up much further; I reflected hungrily that, for more than an hour, he would have to be silent; and I thought with envy of the comparative dusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running a race with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt that he had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he threw out—<br> <br> ‘I want my own sort!’<br> <br> It literally made me bound forward. ‘There are not many of your own sort, Miles!’ I laughed. ‘Unless perhaps dear little Flora!’<br> <br> ‘You really compare me to a baby girl?’<br> <br> This found me singularly weak. ‘Don't you, then, LOVE our sweet Flora?’<br> <br> ‘If I didn't—and you, too; if I didn't—!’ he repeated as if retreating for a jump, yet leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had come into the gate, another stop, which he imposed on me by the pressure of his arm, had become inevitable. Mrs. Grose and Flora had passed into the church, the other worshippers had followed, and we were, for the minute, alone among the old, thick graves. We had paused, on the path from the gate, by a low, oblong, tablelike tomb.<br> <br> ‘Yes, if you didn't—?’<br> <br> He looked, while I waited, at the graves. ‘Well, you know what!’ But he didn't move, and he presently produced something that made me drop straight down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. ‘Does my uncle think what YOU think?’<br> <br> I markedly rested. ‘How do you know what I think?’<br> <br> ‘Ah, well, of course I don't; for it strikes me you never tell me. But I mean does HE know?’<br> <br> ‘Know what, Miles?’<br> <br> ‘Why, the way I'm going on.’<br> <br> I perceived quickly enough that I could make, to this inquiry, no answer that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer. Yet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make that venial. ‘I don't think your uncle much cares.’<br> <br> Miles, on this, stood looking at me. ‘Then don't you think he can be made to?’<br> <br> ‘In what way?’<br> <br> ‘Why, by his coming down.’<br> <br> ‘But who'll get him to come down?’<br> <br> ‘I will!’ the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis. He gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off alone into church.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XV<br> <br> The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed him. It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb and read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its meaning; by the time I had grasped the whole of which I had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay. What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom. My fear was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for that was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind. That his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution that, strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that I simply procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth. The boy, to my deep discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say to me: ‘Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this interruption of my studies, or you cease to expect me to lead with you a life that's so unnatural for a boy.’ What was so unnatural for the particular boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan.<br> <br> That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked round the church, hesitating, hovering; I reflected that I had already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up nothing, and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for an hour in close, silent contact with his commentary on our talk. For the first minute since his arrival I wanted to get away from him. As I paused beneath the high east window and listened to the sounds of worship, I was taken with an impulse that might master me, I felt, completely should I give it the least encouragement. I might easily put an end to my predicament by getting away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I could give the whole thing up—turn my back and retreat. It was only a question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner? That would be in a couple of hours, at the end of which—I had the acute prevision—my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my nonappearance in their train.<br> <br> ‘What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the world, to worry us so—and take our thoughts off, too, don't you know?—did you desert us at the very door?’ I couldn't meet such questions nor, as they asked them, their false little lovely eyes; yet it was all so exactly what I should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last let myself go.<br> <br> I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came straight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my mind I would fly. The Sunday stillness both of the approaches and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have to be remarkable, however, and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle. Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking down at the foot of the staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then, with a revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more than a month before, in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had seen the specter of the most horrible of women. At this I was able to straighten myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to take. But I opened the door to find again, in a flash, my eyes unsealed. In the presence of what I saw I reeled straight back upon my resistance.<br> <br> Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her attitude strangely persisted. Then it was—with the very act of its announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed away. Dark as midnight in her black dress, her haggard beauty and her unutterable woe, she had looked at me long enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It was as a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her—’You terrible, miserable woman!’—I heard myself break into a sound that, by the open door, rang through the long passage and the empty house. She looked at me as if she heard me, but I had recovered myself and cleared the air. There was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XVI<br> <br> I had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked by a demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take into account that they were dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily denouncing and caressing me, they made no allusion to my having failed them, and I was left, for the time, on perceiving that she too said nothing, to study Mrs. Grose's odd face. I did this to such purpose that I made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a silence that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured five minutes with her in the housekeeper's room, where, in the twilight, amid a smell of lately baked bread, but with the place all swept and garnished, I found her sitting in pained placidity before the fire. So I see her still, so I see her best: facing the flame from her straight chair in the dusky, shining room, a large clean image of the ‘put away’—of drawers closed and locked and rest without a remedy.<br> <br> ‘Oh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and to please them—so long as they were there—of course I promised. But what had happened to you?’<br> <br> ‘I only went with you for the walk,’ I said. ‘I had then to come back to meet a friend.’<br> <br> She showed her surprise. ‘A friend—YOU?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, yes, I have a couple!’ I laughed. ‘But did the children give you a reason?’<br> <br> ‘For not alluding to your leaving us? Yes; they said you would like it better. Do you like it better?’<br> <br> My face had made her rueful. ‘No, I like it worse!’ But after an instant I added: ‘Did they say why I should like it better?’<br> <br> ‘No; Master Miles only said, 'We must do nothing but what she likes!'‘<br> <br> ‘I wish indeed he would. And what did Flora say?’<br> <br> ‘Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, 'Oh, of course, of course!'—and I said the same.’<br> <br> I thought a moment. ‘You were too sweet, too—I can hear you all. But nonetheless, between Miles and me, it's now all out.’<br> <br> ‘All out?’ My companion stared. ‘But what, miss?’<br> <br> ‘Everything. It doesn't matter. I've made up my mind. I came home, my dear,’ I went on, ‘for a talk with Miss Jessel.’<br> <br> I had by this time formed the habit of having Mrs. Grose literally well in hand in advance of my sounding that note; so that even now, as she bravely blinked under the signal of my word, I could keep her comparatively firm. ‘A talk! Do you mean she spoke?’<br> <br> ‘It came to that. I found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.’<br> <br> ‘And what did she say?’ I can hear the good woman still, and the candor of her stupefaction.<br> <br> ‘That she suffers the torments—!’<br> <br> It was this, of a truth, that made her, as she filled out my picture, gape. ‘Do you mean,’ she faltered, ‘—of the lost?’<br> <br> ‘Of the lost. Of the damned. And that's why, to share them-’ I faltered myself with the horror of it.<br> <br> But my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. ‘To share them—?’<br> <br> ‘She wants Flora.’ Mrs. Grose might, as I gave it to her, fairly have fallen away from me had I not been prepared. I still held her there, to show I was. ‘As I've told you, however, it doesn't matter.’<br> <br> ‘Because you've made up your mind? But to what?’<br> <br> ‘To everything.’<br> <br> ‘And what do you call 'everything'?’<br> <br> ‘Why, sending for their uncle.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, miss, in pity do,’ my friend broke out. ‘ah, but I will, I WILL! I see it's the only way. What's 'out,' as I told you, with Miles is that if he thinks I'm afraid to—and has ideas of what he gains by that—he shall see he's mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle shall have it here from me on the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if I'm to be reproached with having done nothing again about more school—’<br> <br> ‘Yes, miss—’ my companion pressed me.<br> <br> ‘Well, there's that awful reason.’<br> <br> There were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she was excusable for being vague. ‘But—a—which?’<br> <br> ‘Why, the letter from his old place.’<br> <br> ‘You'll show it to the master?’<br> <br> ‘I ought to have done so on the instant.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, no!’ said Mrs. Grose with decision.<br> <br> ‘I'll put it before him,’ I went on inexorably, ‘that I can't undertake to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled—’<br> <br> ‘For we've never in the least known what!’ Mrs. Grose declared.<br> <br> ‘For wickedness. For what else—when he's so clever and beautiful and perfect? Is he stupid? Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is he ill-natured? He's exquisite—so it can be only THAT; and that would open up the whole thing. After all,’ I said, ‘it's their uncle's fault. If he left here such people—!’<br> <br> ‘He didn't really in the least know them. The fault's mine.’ She had turned quite pale.<br> <br> ‘Well, you shan't suffer,’ I answered.<br> <br> ‘The children shan't!’ she emphatically returned.<br> <br> I was silent awhile; we looked at each other. ‘Then what am I to tell him?’<br> <br> ‘You needn't tell him anything. I'll tell him.’<br> <br> I measured this. ‘Do you mean you'll write—?’ Remembering she couldn't, I caught myself up. ‘How do you communicate?’<br> <br> ‘I tell the bailiff. HE writes.’<br> <br> ‘And should you like him to write our story?’<br> <br> My question had a sarcastic force that I had not fully intended, and it made her, after a moment, inconsequently break down. The tears were again in her eyes. ‘Ah, miss, YOU write!’<br> <br> ‘Well—tonight,’ I at last answered; and on this we separated.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XVII<br> <br> I went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. The weather had changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my room, with Flora at peace beside me, I sat for a long time before a blank sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of the gusts. Finally I went out, taking a candle; I crossed the passage and listened a minute at Miles's door. What, under my endless obsession, I had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his not being at rest, and I presently caught one, but not in the form I had expected. His voice tinkled out. ‘I say, you there—come in.’ It was a gaiety in the gloom!<br> <br> I went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very much at his ease. ‘Well, what are YOU up to?’ he asked with a grace of sociability in which it occurred to me that Mrs. Grose, had she been present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was ‘out.’<br> <br> I stood over him with my candle. ‘How did you know I was there?’<br> <br> ‘Why, of course I heard you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You're like a troop of cavalry!’ he beautifully laughed.<br> <br> ‘Then you weren't asleep?’<br> <br> ‘Not much! I lie awake and think.’<br> <br> I had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed. ‘What is it,’ I asked, ‘that you think of?’<br> <br> ‘What in the world, my dear, but YOU?’<br> <br> ‘Ah, the pride I take in your appreciation doesn't insist on that! I had so far rather you slept.’<br> <br> ‘Well, I think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.’<br> <br> I marked the coolness of his firm little hand. ‘Of what queer business, Miles?’<br> <br> ‘Why, the way you bring me up. And all the rest!’<br> <br> I fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow. ‘What do you mean by all the rest?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, you know, you know!’<br> <br> I could say nothing for a minute, though I felt, as I held his hand and our eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. ‘Certainly you shall go back to school,’ I said, ‘if it be that that troubles you. But not to the old place—we must find another, a better. How could I know it did trouble you, this question, when you never told me so, never spoke of it at all?’ His clear, listening face, framed in its smooth whiteness, made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful patient in a children's hospital; and I would have given, as the resemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps might help! ‘Do you know you've never said a word to me about your school—I mean the old one; never mentioned it in any way?’<br> <br> He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly gained time; he waited, he called for guidance. ‘Haven't I?’ It wasn't for ME to help him—it was for the thing I had met!<br> <br> Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known; so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence and consistency. ‘No, never—from the hour you came back. You've never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of your comrades, nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at school. Never, little Miles—no, never—have you given me an inkling of anything that MAY have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how much I'm in the dark. Until you came out, that way, this morning, you had, since the first hour I saw you, scarce even made a reference to anything in your previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept the present.’ It was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret precocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I dared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person—imposed him almost as an intellectual equal. ‘I thought you wanted to go on as you are.’<br> <br> It struck me that at this he just faintly colored. He gave, at any rate, like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his head. ‘I don't—I don't. I want to get away.’<br> <br> ‘You're tired of Bly?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, no, I like Bly.’<br> <br> ‘Well, then—?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, YOU know what a boy wants!’<br> <br> I felt that I didn't know so well as Miles, and I took temporary refuge. ‘You want to go to your uncle?’<br> <br> Again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the pillow. ‘Ah, you can't get off with that!’<br> <br> I was silent a little, and it was I, now, I think, who changed color. ‘My dear, I don't want to get off!’<br> <br> ‘You can't, even if you do. You can't, you can't!’—he lay beautifully staring. ‘My uncle must come down, and you must completely settle things.’<br> <br> ‘If we do,’ I returned with some spirit, ‘you may be sure it will be to take you quite away.’<br> <br> ‘Well, don't you understand that that's exactly what I'm working for? You'll have to tell him—about the way you've let it all drop: you'll have to tell him a tremendous lot!’<br> <br> The exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow, for the instant, to meet him rather more. ‘And how much will YOU, Miles, have to tell him? There are things he'll ask you!’<br> <br> He turned it over. ‘Very likely. But what things?’<br> <br> ‘The things you've never told me. To make up his mind what to do with you. He can't send you back—’<br> <br> ‘Oh, I don't want to go back!’ he broke in. ‘I want a new field.’<br> <br> He said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable gaiety; and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappearance at the end of three months with all this bravado and still more dishonor. It overwhelmed me now that I should never be able to bear that, and it made me let myself go. I threw myself upon him and in the tenderness of my pity I embraced him. ‘Dear little Miles, dear little Miles—!’<br> <br> My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with indulgent good humor. ‘Well, old lady?’<br> <br> ‘Is there nothing—nothing at all that you want to tell me?’<br> <br> He turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his hand to look at as one had seen sick children look. ‘I've told you—I told you this morning.’<br> <br> Oh, I was sorry for him! ‘That you just want me not to worry you?’<br> <br> He looked round at me now, as if in recognition of my understanding him; then ever so gently, ‘To let me alone,’ he replied.<br> <br> There was even a singular little dignity in it, something that made me release him, yet, when I had slowly risen, linger beside him. God knows I never wished to harass him, but I felt that merely, at this, to turn my back on him was to abandon or, to put it more truly, to lose him. ‘I've just begun a letter to your uncle,’ I said.<br> <br> ‘Well, then, finish it!’<br> <br> I waited a minute. ‘What happened before?’<br> <br> He gazed up at me again. ‘Before what?’<br> <br> ‘Before you came back. And before you went away.’<br> <br> For some time he was silent, but he continued to meet my eyes. ‘What happened?’<br> <br> It made me, the sound of the words, in which it seemed to me that I caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting consciousness—it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize once more the chance of possessing him. ‘Dear little Miles, dear little Miles, if you KNEW how I want to help you! It's only that, it's nothing but that, and I'd rather die than give you a pain or do you a wrong—I'd rather die than hurt a hair of you. Dear little Miles’—oh, I brought it out now even if I SHOULD go too far—’I just want you to help me to save you!’ But I knew in a moment after this that I had gone too far. The answer to my appeal was instantaneous, but it came in the form of an extraordinary blast and chill, a gust of frozen air, and a shake of the room as great as if, in the wild wind, the casement had crashed in. The boy gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the shock of sound, might have seemed, indistinctly, though I was so close to him, a note either of jubilation or of terror. I jumped to my feet again and was conscious of darkness. So for a moment we remained, while I stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred and the window tight. ‘Why, the candle's out!’ I then cried.<br> <br> ‘It was I who blew it, dear!’ said Miles.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XVIII<br> <br> The next day, after lessons, Mrs. Grose found a moment to say to me quietly: ‘Have you written, miss?’<br> <br> ‘Yes—I've written.’ But I didn't add—for the hour—that my letter, sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. There would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the village. Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of MY feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate; there was a distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never was a small natural creature, to the uninitiated eye all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation into which my initiated view betrayed me; to check the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which I constantly both attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman could have done that deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of all evil HAD been opened up to him: all the justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have flowered into an act.<br> <br> He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after our early dinner on this dreadful day, he came round to me and asked if I shouldn't like him, for half an hour, to play to me. David playing to Saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion. It was literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: ‘The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage too far. I know what you mean now: you mean that—to be let alone yourself and not followed up—you'll cease to worry and spy upon me, won't keep me so close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I 'come,' you see—but I don't go! There'll be plenty of time for that. I do really delight in your society, and I only want to show you that I contended for a principle.’ It may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand, to the schoolroom. He sat down at the old piano and played as he had never played; and if there are those who think he had better have been kicking a football I can only say that I wholly agree with them. For at the end of a time that under his influence I had quite ceased to measure, I started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at my post. It was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I hadn't really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much worse—I had forgotten. Where, all this time, was Flora? When I put the question to Miles, he played on a minute before answering and then could only say: ‘Why, my dear, how do I know?’—breaking moreover into a happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.<br> <br> I went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before going downstairs, I looked into several others. As she was nowhere about she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, in the comfort of that theory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of. I found her where I had found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with blank, scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right, for it was the very first time I had allowed the little girl out of my sight without some special provision. Of course now indeed she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look for her without an air of alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but when, ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the hall, it was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we had altogether failed to trace her. For a minute there, apart from observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I could feel with what high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first given her.<br> <br> ‘She'll be above,’ she presently said—’in one of the rooms you haven't searched.’<br> <br> ‘No; she's at a distance.’ I had made up my mind. ‘She has gone out.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose stared. ‘Without a hat?’<br> <br> I naturally also looked volumes. ‘Isn't that woman always without one?’<br> <br> ‘She's with HER?’<br> <br> ‘She's with HER!’ I declared. ‘We must find them.’<br> <br> My hand was on my friend's arm, but she failed for the moment, confronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to my pressure. She communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her uneasiness. ‘And where's Master Miles?’<br> <br> ‘Oh, HE'S with Quint. They're in the schoolroom.’<br> <br> ‘Lord, miss!’ My view, I was myself aware—and therefore I suppose my tone—had never yet reached so calm an assurance.<br> <br> ‘The trick's played,’ I went on; ‘they've successfully worked their plan. He found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she went off.’<br> <br> ‘'Divine'?’ Mrs. Grose bewilderedly echoed.<br> <br> ‘Infernal, then!’ I almost cheerfully rejoined. ‘He has provided for himself as well. But come!’<br> <br> She had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions. ‘You leave him—?’<br> <br> ‘So long with Quint? Yes—I don't mind that now.’<br> <br> She always ended, at these moments, by getting possession of my hand, and in this manner she could at present still stay me. But after gasping an instant at my sudden resignation, ‘Because of your letter?’ she eagerly brought out.<br> <br> I quickly, by way of answer, felt for my letter, drew it forth, held it up, and then, freeing myself, went and laid it on the great hall table. ‘Luke will take it,’ I said as I came back. I reached the house door and opened it; I was already on the steps.<br> <br> My companion still demurred: the storm of the night and the early morning had dropped, but the afternoon was damp and gray. I came down to the drive while she stood in the doorway. ‘You go with nothing on?’<br> <br> ‘What do I care when the child has nothing? I can't wait to dress,’ I cried, ‘and if you must do so, I leave you. Try meanwhile, yourself, upstairs.’<br> <br> ‘With THEM?’ Oh, on this, the poor woman promptly joined me!<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XIX<br> <br> We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay rightly called, though I reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes. My acquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home. She had not given me the slip for any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that I had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to Mrs. Grose's steps so marked a direction—a direction that made her, when she perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly mystified. ‘You're going to the water, Miss?—you think she's IN—?’<br> <br> ‘She may be, though the depth is, I believe, nowhere very great. But what I judge most likely is that she's on the spot from which, the other day, we saw together what I told you.’<br> <br> ‘When she pretended not to see—?’<br> <br> ‘With that astounding self-possession? I've always been sure she wanted to go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose still stood where she had stopped. ‘You suppose they really TALK of them?’<br> <br> ‘I could meet this with a confidence! They say things that, if we heard them, would simply appall us.’<br> <br> ‘And if she IS there—’<br> <br> ‘Yes?’<br> <br> ‘Then Miss Jessel is?’<br> <br> ‘Beyond a doubt. You shall see.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, thank you!’ my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I went straight on without her. By the time I reached the pool, however, she was close behind me, and I knew that, whatever, to her apprehension, might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as her least danger. She exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child. There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came down to the water. The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant compared to its length that, with its ends out of view, it might have been taken for a scant river. We looked at the empty expanse, and then I felt the suggestion of my friend's eyes. I knew what she meant and I replied with a negative headshake.<br> <br> ‘No, no; wait! She has taken the boat.’<br> <br> My companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across the lake. ‘Then where is it?’<br> <br> ‘Our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. She has used it to go over, and then has managed to hide it.’<br> <br> ‘All alone—that child?’<br> <br> ‘She's not alone, and at such times she's not a child: she's an old, old woman.’ I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose took again, into the queer element I offered her, one of her plunges of submission; then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump of trees growing close to the water.<br> <br> ‘But if the boat's there, where on earth's SHE?’ my colleague anxiously asked.<br> <br> ‘That's exactly what we must learn.’ And I started to walk further.<br> <br> ‘By going all the way round?’<br> <br> ‘Certainly, far as it is. It will take us but ten minutes, but it's far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight over.’<br> <br> ‘Laws!’ cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much for her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got halfway round—a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by a path choked with overgrowth—I paused to give her breath. I sustained her with a grateful arm, assuring her that she might hugely help me; and this started us afresh, so that in the course of but few minutes more we reached a point from which we found the boat to be where I had supposed it. It had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just there, down to the brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking. I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short, thick oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the feat for a little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in the fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling interval, more into the open. Then, ‘There she is!’ we both exclaimed at once.<br> <br> Flora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as if her performance was now complete. The next thing she did, however, was to stoop straight down and pluck—quite as if it were all she was there for—a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became sure she had just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself taking a step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently approached her. She smiled and smiled, and we met; but it was all done in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. Mrs. Grose was the first to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender, yielding body. While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only watch it—which I did the more intently when I saw Flora's face peep at me over our companion's shoulder. It was serious now—the flicker had left it; but it strengthened the pang with which I at that moment envied Mrs. Grose the simplicity of HER relation. Still, all this while, nothing more passed between us save that Flora had let her foolish fern again drop to the ground. What she and I had virtually said to each other was that pretexts were useless now. When Mrs. Grose finally got up she kept the child's hand, so that the two were still before me; and the singular reticence of our communion was even more marked in the frank look she launched me. ‘I'll be hanged,’ it said, ‘if I'll speak!’<br> <br> It was Flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first. She was struck with our bareheaded aspect. ‘Why, where are your things?’<br> <br> ‘Where yours are, my dear!’ I promptly returned.<br> <br> She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient. ‘And where's Miles?’ she went on.<br> <br> There was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me: these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, I felt overflow in a deluge. ‘I'll tell you if you'll tell ME—’ I heard myself say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.<br> <br> ‘Well, what?’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose's suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and I brought the thing out handsomely. ‘Where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?’<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XX<br> <br> Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the whole thing was upon us. Much as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us, been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child's face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a pane of glass. It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow, that Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence—the shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized my colleague's arm. ‘She's there, she's there!’<br> <br> Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time, and I remember, strangely, as the first feeling now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. She was there, and I was justified; she was there, and I was neither cruel nor mad. She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there most for Flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out to her—with the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and understand it—an inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on the spot my friend and I had lately quitted, and there was not, in all the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. This first vividness of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds, during which Mrs. Grose's dazed blink across to where I pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carried my own eyes precipitately to the child. The revelation then of the manner in which Flora was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay was of course not what I had expected. Prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and I was therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first glimpse of the particular one for which I had not allowed. To see her, without a convulsion of her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of that, turn at ME an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge me—this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail. I quailed even though my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that instant, and in the immediate need to defend myself I called it passionately to witness. ‘She's there, you little unhappy thing—there, there, THERE, and you see her as well as you see me!’ I had said shortly before to Mrs. Grose that she was not at these times a child, but an old, old woman, and that description of her could not have been more strikingly confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to this, she simply showed me, without a concession, an admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. I was by this time—if I can put the whole thing at all together—more appalled at what I may properly call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously with this that I became aware of having Mrs. Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with. My elder companion, the next moment, at any rate, blotted out everything but her own flushed face and her loud, shocked protest, a burst of high disapproval. ‘What a dreadful turn, to be sure, miss! Where on earth do you see anything?’<br> <br> I could only grasp her more quickly yet, for even while she spoke the hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted. It had already lasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague, quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my pointing hand. ‘You don't see her exactly as WE see?—you mean to say you don't now—NOW? She's as big as a blazing fire! Only look, dearest woman, LOOK—!’ She looked, even as I did, and gave me, with her deep groan of negation, repulsion, compassion—the mixture with her pity of her relief at her exemption—a sense, touching to me even then, that she would have backed me up if she could. I might well have needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed I felt my own situation horribly crumble, I felt—I saw—my livid predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was conscious, more than all, of what I should have from this instant to deal with in the astounding little attitude of Flora. Into this attitude Mrs. Grose immediately and violently entered, breaking, even while there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private triumph, into breathless reassurance.<br> <br> ‘She isn't there, little lady, and nobody's there—and you never see nothing, my sweet! How can poor Miss Jessel—when poor Miss Jessel's dead and buried? WE know, don't we, love?’—and she appealed, blundering in, to the child. ‘It's all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke—and we'll go home as fast as we can!’<br> <br> Our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of propriety, and they were again, with Mrs. Grose on her feet, united, as it were, in pained opposition to me. Flora continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute I prayed God to forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight to our friend's dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly failed, had quite vanished. I've said it already—she was literally, she was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. ‘I don't know what you mean. I see nobody. I see nothing. I never HAVE. I think you're cruel. I don't like you!’ Then, after this deliverance, which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful little face. In this position she produced an almost furious wail. ‘Take me away, take me away—oh, take me away from HER!’<br> <br> ‘From ME?’ I panted.<br> <br> ‘From you—from you!’ she cried.<br> <br> Even Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed, while I had nothing to do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank, without a movement, as rigidly still as if catching, beyond the interval, our voices, was as vividly there for my disaster as it was not there for my service. The wretched child had spoken exactly as if she had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words, and I could therefore, in the full despair of all I had to accept, but sadly shake my head at her. ‘If I had ever doubted, all my doubt would at present have gone. I've been living with the miserable truth, and now it has only too much closed round me. Of course I've lost you: I've interfered, and you've seen—under HER dictation’—with which I faced, over the pool again, our infernal witness—’the easy and perfect way to meet it. I've done my best, but I've lost you. Goodbye.’ For Mrs. Grose I had an imperative, an almost frantic ‘Go, go!’ before which, in infinite distress, but mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly convinced, in spite of her blindness, that something awful had occurred and some collapse engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come, as fast as she could move.<br> <br> Of what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent memory. I only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an hour, an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and piercing my trouble, had made me understand that I must have thrown myself, on my face, on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief. I must have lain there long and cried and sobbed, for when I raised my head the day was almost done. I got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, at the gray pool and its blank, haunted edge, and then I took, back to the house, my dreary and difficult course. When I reached the gate in the fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a fresh reflection to make on Flora's extraordinary command of the situation. She passed that night, by the most tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw—I can use no other phrase—so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; in spite of which—and in spite also of the deeper depths of consternation that had opened beneath my feet—there was literally, in the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness. On reaching the house I had never so much as looked for the boy; I had simply gone straight to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, at a glance, much material testimony to Flora's rupture. Her little belongings had all been removed. When later, by the schoolroom fire, I was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged, on the article of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now—he might have it to the end! Well, he did have it; and it consisted—in part at least—of his coming in at about eight o'clock and sitting down with me in silence. On the removal of the tea things I had blown out the candles and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a mortal coldness and felt as if I should never again be warm. So, when he appeared, I was sitting in the glow with my thoughts. He paused a moment by the door as if to look at me; then—as if to share them—came to the other side of the hearth and sank into a chair. We sat there in absolute stillness; yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XXI<br> <br> Before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to Mrs. Grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. Flora was so markedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, governess. It was not against the possible re-entrance of Miss Jessel on the scene that she protested—it was conspicuously and passionately against mine. I was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense deal to ask; the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her loins to meet me once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her the question of her sense of the child's sincerity as against my own. ‘She persists in denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?’<br> <br> My visitor's trouble, truly, was great. ‘Ah, miss, it isn't a matter on which I can push her! Yet it isn't either, I must say, as if I much needed to. It has made her, every inch of her, quite old.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, I see her perfectly from here. She resents, for all the world like some high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness and, as it were, her respectability. 'Miss Jessel indeed—SHE!' Ah, she's 'respectable,' the chit! The impression she gave me there yesterday was, I assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any of the others. I DID put my foot in it! She'll never speak to me again.’<br> <br> Hideous and obscure as it all was, it held Mrs. Grose briefly silent; then she granted my point with a frankness which, I made sure, had more behind it. ‘I think indeed, miss, she never will. She do have a grand manner about it!’<br> <br> ‘And that manner’—I summed it up—’is practically what's the matter with her now!’<br> <br> Oh, that manner, I could see in my visitor's face, and not a little else besides! ‘She asks me every three minutes if I think you're coming in.’<br> <br> ‘I see—I see.’ I, too, on my side, had so much more than worked it out. ‘Has she said to you since yesterday—except to repudiate her familiarity with anything so dreadful—a single other word about Miss Jessel?’<br> <br> ‘Not one, miss. And of course you know,’ my friend added, ‘I took it from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there WAS nobody.’<br> <br> ‘Rather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.’<br> <br> ‘I don't contradict her. What else can I do?’<br> <br> ‘Nothing in the world! You've the cleverest little person to deal with. They've made them—their two friends, I mean—still cleverer even than nature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! Flora has now her grievance, and she'll work it to the end.’<br> <br> ‘Yes, miss; but to WHAT end?’<br> <br> ‘Why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. She'll make me out to him the lowest creature—!’<br> <br> I winced at the fair show of the scene in Mrs. Grose's face; she looked for a minute as if she sharply saw them together. ‘And him who thinks so well of you!’<br> <br> ‘He has an odd way—it comes over me now,’ I laughed,’—of proving it! But that doesn't matter. What Flora wants, of course, is to get rid of me.’<br> <br> My companion bravely concurred. ‘Never again to so much as look at you.’<br> <br> ‘So that what you've come to me now for,’ I asked, ‘is to speed me on my way?’ Before she had time to reply, however, I had her in check. ‘I've a better idea—the result of my reflections. My going WOULD seem the right thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it. Yet that won't do. It's YOU who must go. You must take Flora.’<br> <br> My visitor, at this, did speculate. ‘But where in the world—?’<br> <br> ‘Away from here. Away from THEM. Away, even most of all, now, from me. Straight to her uncle.’<br> <br> ‘Only to tell on you—?’<br> <br> ‘No, not 'only'! To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.’<br> <br> She was still vague. ‘And what IS your remedy?’<br> <br> ‘Your loyalty, to begin with. And then Miles's.’<br> <br> She looked at me hard. ‘Do you think he—?’<br> <br> ‘Won't, if he has the chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still to think it. At all events, I want to try. Get off with his sister as soon as possible and leave me with him alone.’ I was amazed, myself, at the spirit I had still in reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more disconcerted at the way in which, in spite of this fine example of it, she hesitated. ‘There's one thing, of course,’ I went on: ‘they mustn't, before she goes, see each other for three seconds.’ Then it came over me that, in spite of Flora's presumable sequestration from the instant of her return from the pool, it might already be too late. ‘Do you mean,’ I anxiously asked, ‘that they HAVE met?’<br> <br> At this she quite flushed. ‘Ah, miss, I'm not such a fool as that! If I've been obliged to leave her three or four times, it has been each time with one of the maids, and at present, though she's alone, she's locked in safe. And yet—and yet!’ There were too many things.<br> <br> ‘And yet what?’<br> <br> ‘Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?’<br> <br> ‘I'm not sure of anything but YOU. But I have, since last evening, a new hope. I think he wants to give me an opening. I do believe that—poor little exquisite wretch!—he wants to speak. Last evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours as if it were just coming.’<br> <br> Mrs. Grose looked hard, through the window, at the gray, gathering day. ‘And did it come?’<br> <br> ‘No, though I waited and waited, I confess it didn't, and it was without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his sister's condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night. All the same,’ I continued, ‘I can't, if her uncle sees her, consent to his seeing her brother without my having given the boy—and most of all because things have got so bad—a little more time.’<br> <br> My friend appeared on this ground more reluctant than I could quite understand. ‘What do you mean by more time?’<br> <br> ‘Well, a day or two—really to bring it out. He'll then be on MY side—of which you see the importance. If nothing comes, I shall only fail, and you will, at the worst, have helped me by doing, on your arrival in town, whatever you may have found possible.’ So I put it before her, but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed that I came again to her aid. ‘Unless, indeed,’ I wound up, ‘you really want NOT to go.’<br> <br> I could see it, in her face, at last clear itself; she put out her hand to me as a pledge. ‘I'll go—I'll go. I'll go this morning.’<br> <br> I wanted to be very just. ‘If you SHOULD wish still to wait, I would engage she shouldn't see me.’<br> <br> ‘No, no: it's the place itself. She must leave it.’ She held me a moment with heavy eyes, then brought out the rest. ‘Your idea's the right one. I myself, miss—’<br> <br> ‘Well?’<br> <br> ‘I can't stay.’<br> <br> The look she gave me with it made me jump at possibilities. ‘You mean that, since yesterday, you HAVE seen—?’<br> <br> She shook her head with dignity. ‘I've HEARD—!’<br> <br> ‘Heard?’<br> <br> ‘From that child—horrors! There!’ she sighed with tragic relief. ‘On my honor, miss, she says things—!’ But at this evocation she broke down; she dropped, with a sudden sob, upon my sofa and, as I had seen her do before, gave way to all the grief of it.<br> <br> It was quite in another manner that I, for my part, let myself go. ‘Oh, thank God!’<br> <br> She sprang up again at this, drying her eyes with a groan. ‘'Thank God'?’<br> <br> ‘It so justifies me!’<br> <br> ‘It does that, miss!’<br> <br> I couldn't have desired more emphasis, but I just hesitated. ‘She's so horrible?’<br> <br> I saw my colleague scarce knew how to put it. ‘Really shocking.’<br> <br> ‘And about me?’<br> <br> ‘About you, miss—since you must have it. It's beyond everything, for a young lady; and I can't think wherever she must have picked up—’<br> <br> ‘The appalling language she applied to me? I can, then!’ I broke in with a laugh that was doubtless significant enough.<br> <br> It only, in truth, left my friend still more grave. ‘Well, perhaps I ought to also—since I've heard some of it before! Yet I can't bear it,’ the poor woman went on while, with the same movement, she glanced, on my dressing table, at the face of my watch. ‘But I must go back.’<br> <br> I kept her, however. ‘Ah, if you can't bear it—!’<br> <br> ‘How can I stop with her, you mean? Why, just FOR that: to get her away. Far from this,’ she pursued, ‘far from THEM-’<br> <br> ‘She may be different? She may be free?’ I seized her almost with joy. ‘Then, in spite of yesterday, you BELIEVE—’<br> <br> ‘In such doings?’ Her simple description of them required, in the light of her expression, to be carried no further, and she gave me the whole thing as she had never done. ‘I believe.’<br> <br> Yes, it was a joy, and we were still shoulder to shoulder: if I might continue sure of that I should care but little what else happened. My support in the presence of disaster would be the same as it had been in my early need of confidence, and if my friend would answer for my honesty, I would answer for all the rest. On the point of taking leave of her, nonetheless, I was to some extent embarrassed. ‘There's one thing, of course—it occurs to me—to remember. My letter, giving the alarm, will have reached town before you.’<br> <br> I now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and how weary at last it had made her. ‘Your letter won't have got there. Your letter never went.’<br> <br> ‘What then became of it?’<br> <br> ‘Goodness knows! Master Miles—’<br> <br> ‘Do you mean HE took it?’ I gasped.<br> <br> She hung fire, but she overcame her reluctance. ‘I mean that I saw yesterday, when I came back with Miss Flora, that it wasn't where you had put it. Later in the evening I had the chance to question Luke, and he declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it.’ We could only exchange, on this, one of our deeper mutual soundings, and it was Mrs. Grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated ‘You see!’<br> <br> ‘Yes, I see that if Miles took it instead he probably will have read it and destroyed it.’<br> <br> ‘And don't you see anything else?’<br> <br> I faced her a moment with a sad smile. ‘It strikes me that by this time your eyes are open even wider than mine.’<br> <br> They proved to be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show it. ‘I make out now what he must have done at school.’ And she gave, in her simple sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. ‘He stole!’<br> <br> I turned it over—I tried to be more judicial. ‘Well—perhaps.’<br> <br> She looked as if she found me unexpectedly calm. ‘He stole LETTERS!’<br> <br> She couldn't know my reasons for a calmness after all pretty shallow; so I showed them off as I might. ‘I hope then it was to more purpose than in this case! The note, at any rate, that I put on the table yesterday,’ I pursued, ‘will have given him so scant an advantage—for it contained only the bare demand for an interview—that he is already much ashamed of having gone so far for so little, and that what he had on his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession.’ I seemed to myself, for the instant, to have mastered it, to see it all. ‘Leave us, leave us’—I was already, at the door, hurrying her off. ‘I'll get it out of him. He'll meet me—he'll confess. If he confesses, he's saved. And if he's saved—’<br> <br> ‘Then YOU are?’ The dear woman kissed me on this, and I took her farewell. ‘I'll save you without him!’ she cried as she went.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XXII<br> <br> Yet it was when she had got off—and I missed her on the spot—that the great pinch really came. If I had counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with Miles, I speedily perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure. No hour of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the gates. Now I WAS, I said to myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of the day, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash. It was a tighter place still than I had yet turned round in; all the more that, for the first time, I could see in the aspect of others a confused reflection of the crisis. What had happened naturally caused them all to stare; there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever we might, in the suddenness of my colleague's act. The maids and the men looked blank; the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid. It was precisely, in short, by just clutching the helm that I avoided total wreck; and I dare say that, to bear up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and very dry. I welcomed the consciousness that I was charged with much to do, and I caused it to be known as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for the next hour or two, all over the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern, I paraded with a sick heart.<br> <br> The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora's interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. He had already disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of the maids—with Mrs. Grose and his sister. He had then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, could better have expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office. What he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer relief, at all events—I mean for myself in especial—in the renouncement of one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply shown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.<br> <br> To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside of the window of which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that first scared Sunday, my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light. Here at present I felt afresh—for I had felt it again and again—how my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will, the will to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what I had to deal with was, revoltingly, against nature. I could only get on at all by taking ‘nature’ into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course, and unpleasant, but demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact than just this attempt to supply, one's self, ALL the nature. How could I put even a little of that article into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other hand, could I make reference without a new plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably, by the quickened vision of what was rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found even now—as he had so often found at lessons—still some other delicate way to ease me off. Wasn't there light in the fact which, as we shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his intelligence been given him for but to save him? Mightn't one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over his character? It was as if, when we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the way. The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with attendance. Miles, before he sat down, stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment. But what he presently produced was: ‘I say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?’<br> <br> ‘Little Flora? Not so bad but that she'll presently be better. London will set her up. Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come here and take your mutton.’<br> <br> He alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and, when he was established, went on. ‘Did Bly disagree with her so terribly suddenly?’<br> <br> ‘Not so suddenly as you might think. One had seen it coming on.’<br> <br> ‘Then why didn't you get her off before?’<br> <br> ‘Before what?’<br> <br> ‘Before she became too ill to travel.’<br> <br> I found myself prompt. ‘She's NOT too ill to travel: she only might have become so if she had stayed. This was just the moment to seize. The journey will dissipate the influence’—oh, I was grand!—’and carry it off.’<br> <br> ‘I see, I see’—Miles, for that matter, was grand, too. He settled to his repast with the charming little ‘table manner’ that, from the day of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of admonition. Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation. Our meal was of the briefest—mine a vain pretense, and I had the things immediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his hands in his little pockets and his back to me—stood and looked out of the wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what pulled me up. We continued silent while the maid was with us—as silent, it whimsically occurred to me, as some young couple who, on their wedding journey, at the inn, feel shy in the presence of the waiter. He turned round only when the waiter had left us. ‘Well—so we're alone!’<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XXIII<br> <br> ‘Oh, more or less.’ I fancy my smile was pale. ‘Not absolutely. We shouldn't like that!’ I went on.<br> <br> ‘No—I suppose we shouldn't. Of course we have the others.’<br> <br> ‘We have the others—we have indeed the others,’ I concurred.<br> <br> ‘Yet even though we have them,’ he returned, still with his hands in his pockets and planted there in front of me, ‘they don't much count, do they?’<br> <br> I made the best of it, but I felt wan. ‘It depends on what you call 'much'!’<br> <br> ‘Yes’—with all accommodation—’everything depends!’ On this, however, he faced to the window again and presently reached it with his vague, restless, cogitating step. He remained there awhile, with his forehead against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I knew and the dull things of November. I had always my hypocrisy of ‘work,’ behind which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying myself with it there as I had repeatedly done at those moments of torment that I have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given to something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me as I extracted a meaning from the boy's embarrassed back—none other than the impression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in a few minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct perception that it was positively HE who was. The frames and squares of the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of failure. I felt that I saw him, at any rate, shut in or shut out. He was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb of hope. Wasn't he looking, through the haunted pane, for something he couldn't see?—and wasn't it the first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse? The first, the very first: I found it a splendid portent. It made him anxious, though he watched himself; he had been anxious all day and, even while in his usual sweet little manner he sat at table, had needed all his small strange genius to give it a gloss. When he at last turned round to meet me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed. ‘Well, I think I'm glad Bly agrees with ME!’<br> <br> ‘You would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good deal more of it than for some time before. I hope,’ I went on bravely, ‘that you've been enjoying yourself.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, yes, I've been ever so far; all round about—miles and miles away. I've never been so free.’<br> <br> He had really a manner of his own, and I could only try to keep up with him. ‘Well, do you like it?’<br> <br> He stood there smiling; then at last he put into two words—’Do YOU?’—more discrimination than I had ever heard two words contain. Before I had time to deal with that, however, he continued as if with the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened. ‘Nothing could be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we're alone together now it's you that are alone most. But I hope,’ he threw in, ‘you don't particularly mind!’<br> <br> ‘Having to do with you?’ I asked. ‘My dear child, how can I help minding? Though I've renounced all claim to your company—you're so beyond me—I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?’<br> <br> He looked at me more directly, and the expression of his face, graver now, struck me as the most beautiful I had ever found in it. ‘You stay on just for THAT?’<br> <br> ‘Certainly. I stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest I take in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth your while. That needn't surprise you.’ My voice trembled so that I felt it impossible to suppress the shake. ‘Don't you remember how I told you, when I came and sat on your bed the night of the storm, that there was nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you?’<br> <br> ‘Yes, yes!’ He, on his side, more and more visibly nervous, had a tone to master; but he was so much more successful than I that, laughing out through his gravity, he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting. ‘Only that, I think, was to get me to do something for YOU!’<br> <br> ‘It was partly to get you to do something,’ I conceded. ‘But, you know, you didn't do it.’<br> <br> ‘Oh, yes,’ he said with the brightest superficial eagerness, ‘you wanted me to tell you something.’<br> <br> ‘That's it. Out, straight out. What you have on your mind, you know.’<br> <br> ‘Ah, then, is THAT what you've stayed over for?’<br> <br> He spoke with a gaiety through which I could still catch the finest little quiver of resentful passion; but I can't begin to express the effect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint. It was as if what I had yearned for had come at last only to astonish me. ‘Well, yes—I may as well make a clean breast of it, it was precisely for that.’<br> <br> He waited so long that I supposed it for the purpose of repudiating the assumption on which my action had been founded; but what he finally said was: ‘Do you mean now—here?’<br> <br> ‘There couldn't be a better place or time.’ He looked round him uneasily, and I had the rare—oh, the queer!—impression of the very first symptom I had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. It was as if he were suddenly afraid of me—which struck me indeed as perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the effort I felt it vain to try sternness, and I heard myself the next instant so gentle as to be almost grotesque. ‘You want so to go out again?’<br> <br> ‘Awfully!’ He smiled at me heroically, and the touching little bravery of it was enhanced by his actually flushing with pain. He had picked up his hat, which he had brought in, and stood twirling it in a way that gave me, even as I was just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of what I was doing. To do it in ANY way was an act of violence, for what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the possibilities of beautiful intercourse? Wasn't it base to create for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I suppose I now read into our situation a clearness it couldn't have had at the time, for I seem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a prevision of the anguish that was to come. So we circled about, with terrors and scruples, like fighters not daring to close. But it was for each other we feared! That kept us a little longer suspended and unbruised. ‘I'll tell you everything,’ Miles said—’I mean I'll tell you anything you like. You'll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I WILL tell you—I WILL. But not now.’<br> <br> ‘Why not now?’<br> <br> My insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop. Then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside, someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. ‘I have to see Luke.’<br> <br> I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie, and I felt proportionately ashamed. But, horrible as it was, his lies made up my truth. I achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my knitting. ‘Well, then, go to Luke, and I'll wait for what you promise. Only, in return for that, satisfy, before you leave me, one very much smaller request.’<br> <br> He looked as if he felt he had succeeded enough to be able still a little to bargain. ‘Very much smaller—?’<br> <br> ‘Yes, a mere fraction of the whole. Tell me’—oh, my work preoccupied me, and I was offhand!—’if, yesterday afternoon, from the table in the hall, you took, you know, my letter.’<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> XXIV<br> <br> My sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something that I can describe only as a fierce split of my attention—a stroke that at first, as I sprang straight up, reduced me to the mere blind movement of getting hold of him, drawing him close, and, while I just fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively keeping him with his back to the window. The appearance was full upon us that I had already had to deal with here: Peter Quint had come into view like a sentinel before a prison. The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he had reached the window, and then I knew that, close to the glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room his white face of damnation. It represents but grossly what took place within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made; yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered her grasp of the ACT. It came to me in the very horror of the immediate presence that the act would be, seeing and facing what I saw and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration—I can call it by no other name—was that I felt how voluntarily, how transcendently, I MIGHT. It was like fighting with a demon for a human soul, and when I had fairly so appraised it I saw how the human soul—held out, in the tremor of my hands, at arm's length—had a perfect dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. The face that was close to mine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it presently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further away, that I drank like a waft of fragrance.<br> <br> ‘Yes—I took it.’<br> <br> At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I held him to my breast, where I could feel in the sudden fever of his little body the tremendous pulse of his little heart, I kept my eyes on the thing at the window and saw it move and shift its posture. I have likened it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather the prowl of a baffled beast. My present quickened courage, however, was such that, not too much to let it through, I had to shade, as it were, my flame. Meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the window, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. It was the very confidence that I might now defy him, as well as the positive certitude, by this time, of the child's unconsciousness, that made me go on. ‘What did you take it for?’<br> <br> ‘To see what you said about me.’<br> <br> ‘You opened the letter?’<br> <br> ‘I opened it.’<br> <br> My eyes were now, as I held him off a little again, on Miles's own face, in which the collapse of mockery showed me how complete was the ravage of uneasiness. What was prodigious was that at last, by my success, his sense was sealed and his communication stopped: he knew that he was in presence, but knew not of what, and knew still less that I also was and that I did know. And what did this strain of trouble matter when my eyes went back to the window only to see that the air was clear again and—by my personal triumph—the influence quenched? There was nothing there. I felt that the cause was mine and that I should surely get ALL. ‘And you found nothing!’—I let my elation out.<br> <br> He gave the most mournful, thoughtful little headshake. ‘Nothing.’<br> <br> ‘Nothing, nothing!’ I almost shouted in my joy.<br> <br> ‘Nothing, nothing,’ he sadly repeated.<br> <br> I kissed his forehead; it was drenched. ‘So what have you done with it?’<br> <br> ‘I've burned it.’<br> <br> ‘Burned it?’ It was now or never. ‘Is that what you did at school?’<br> <br> Oh, what this brought up! ‘At school?’<br> <br> ‘Did you take letters?—or other things?’<br> <br> ‘Other things?’ He appeared now to be thinking of something far off and that reached him only through the pressure of his anxiety. Yet it did reach him. ‘Did I STEAL?’<br> <br> I felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him take it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the world. ‘Was it for that you mightn't go back?’<br> <br> The only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise. ‘Did you know I mightn't go back?’<br> <br> ‘I know everything.’<br> <br> He gave me at this the longest and strangest look. ‘Everything?’<br> <br> ‘Everything. Therefore DID you—?’ But I couldn't say it again.<br> <br> Miles could, very simply. ‘No. I didn't steal.’<br> <br> My face must have shown him I believed him utterly; yet my hands—but it was for pure tenderness—shook him as if to ask him why, if it was all for nothing, he had condemned me to months of torment. ‘What then did you do?’<br> <br> He looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his breath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. He might have been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some faint green twilight. ‘Well—I said things.’<br> <br> ‘Only that?’<br> <br> ‘They thought it was enough!’<br> <br> ‘To turn you out for?’<br> <br> Never, truly, had a person ‘turned out’ shown so little to explain it as this little person! He appeared to weigh my question, but in a manner quite detached and almost helpless. ‘Well, I suppose I oughtn't.’<br> <br> ‘But to whom did you say them?’<br> <br> He evidently tried to remember, but it dropped—he had lost it. ‘I don't know!’<br> <br> He almost smiled at me in the desolation of his surrender, which was indeed practically, by this time, so complete that I ought to have left it there. But I was infatuated—I was blind with victory, though even then the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was already that of added separation. ‘Was it to everyone?’ I asked.<br> <br> ‘No; it was only to—’ But he gave a sick little headshake. ‘I don't remember their names.’<br> <br> ‘Were they then so many?’<br> <br> ‘No—only a few. Those I liked.’<br> <br> Those he liked? I seemed to float not into clearness, but into a darker obscure, and within a minute there had come to me out of my very pity the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent. It was for the instant confounding and bottomless, for if he WERE innocent, what then on earth was I? Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of the question, I let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh, he turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear window, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to keep him from. ‘And did they repeat what you said?’ I went on after a moment.<br> <br> He was soon at some distance from me, still breathing hard and again with the air, though now without anger for it, of being confined against his will. Once more, as he had done before, he looked up at the dim day as if, of what had hitherto sustained him, nothing was left but an unspeakable anxiety. ‘Oh, yes,’ he nevertheless replied—’they must have repeated them. To those THEY liked,’ he added.<br> <br> There was, somehow, less of it than I had expected; but I turned it over. ‘And these things came round—?’<br> <br> ‘To the masters? Oh, yes!’ he answered very simply. ‘But I didn't know they'd tell.’<br> <br> ‘The masters? They didn't—they've never told. That's why I ask you.’<br> <br> He turned to me again his little beautiful fevered face. ‘Yes, it was too bad.’<br> <br> ‘Too bad?’<br> <br> ‘What I suppose I sometimes said. To write home.’<br> <br> I can't name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction given to such a speech by such a speaker; I only know that the next instant I heard myself throw off with homely force: ‘Stuff and nonsense!’ But the next after that I must have sounded stern enough. ‘What WERE these things?’<br> <br> My sternness was all for his judge, his executioner; yet it made him avert himself again, and that movement made ME, with a single bound and an irrepressible cry, spring straight upon him. For there again, against the glass, as if to blight his confession and stay his answer, was the hideous author of our woe—the white face of damnation. I felt a sick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my battle, so that the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a great betrayal. I saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on the perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was still to his own eyes free, I let the impulse flame up to convert the climax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. ‘No more, no more, no more!’ I shrieked, as I tried to press him against me, to my visitant.<br> <br> ‘Is she HERE?’ Miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the direction of my words. Then as his strange ‘she’ staggered me and, with a gasp, I echoed it, ‘Miss Jessel, Miss Jessel!’ he with a sudden fury gave me back.<br> <br> I seized, stupefied, his supposition—some sequel to what we had done to Flora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still than that. ‘It's not Miss Jessel! But it's at the window—straight before us. It's THERE—the coward horror, there for the last time!’<br> <br> At this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled dog's on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled the room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence. ‘It's HE?’<br> <br> I was so determined to have all my proof that I flashed into ice to challenge him. ‘Whom do you mean by 'he'?’<br> <br> ‘Peter Quint—you devil!’ His face gave again, round the room, its convulsed supplication. ‘WHERE?’<br> <br> They are in my ears still, his supreme surrender of the name and his tribute to my devotion. ‘What does he matter now, my own?—what will he EVER matter? I have you,’ I launched at the beast, ‘but he has lost you forever!’ Then, for the demonstration of my work, ‘There, THERE!’ I said to Miles.<br> <br> But he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and seen but the quiet day. With the stroke of the loss I was so proud of he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss, and the grasp with which I recovered him might have been that of catching him in his fall. I caught him, yes, I held him—it may be imagined with what a passion; but at the end of a minute I began to feel what it truly was that I held. We were alone with the quiet day, and his little heart, dispossessed, had stopped.</p>"}
