				"main_text": "I had a dream, which was not all a dream.<br>The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars<br>Did wander darkling in the eternal space,<br>Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth<br>Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;<br>Morn came and went-and came, and brought no day,<br>And men forgot their passions in the dread<br>Of this their desolation; and all hearts<br>Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light;<br>And they did live by watchfires-and the thrones,<br>The palaces of crowned kings-the huts,<br>The habitations of all things which dwell,<br>Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,<br>And men were gathered round their blazing homes<br>To look once more into each other's face;<br>Happy were those which dwelt within the eye<br>Of the volcanoes, and their mountain-torch;<br>A fearful hope was all the world contained;<br>Forests were set on fire-but hour by hour<br>They fell and faded-and the crackling trunks<br>Extinguished with a crash-and all was black.<br>The brows of men by the despairing light<br>Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits<br>The flashes fell upon them: some lay down<br>And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest<br>Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;<br>And others hurried to and fro, and fed<br>Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up<br>With mad disquietude on the dull sky,<br>The pall of a past world; and then again<br>With curses cast them down upon the dust,<br>And gnashed their teeth and howled; the wild birds shrieked,<br>And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,<br>And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes<br>Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled<br>And twined themselves among the multitude,<br>Hissing, but stingless-they were slain for food;<br>And War, which for a moment was no more,<br>Did glut himself again;-a meal was bought<br>With blood, and each sate sullenly apart<br>Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left;<br>All earth was but one thought-and that was death,<br>Immediate and inglorious; and the pang<br>Of famine fed upon all entrails-men<br>Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;<br>The meagre by the meagre were devoured,<br>Even dogs assailed their masters, all save one,<br>And he was faithful to a corse, and kept<br>The birds and beasts and famished men at bay,<br>Till hunger clung them, or the drooping dead<br>Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,<br>But with a piteous and perpetual moan,<br>And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand<br>Which answered not with a caress-he died.<br>The crowd was famished by degrees; but two<br>Of an enormous city did survive,<br>And hey were enemies: they met beside<br>The dying embers of an altar-place<br>Where had been heaped a mass of holy things<br>For an unholy usage: they raked up,<br>And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands<br>The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath<br>Blew for a little life, and made a flame<br>Which was a mockery; then they lifted up<br>Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld<br>Each other's aspects-saw, and shrieked, and died-<br>Even of their mutual hideousness they died,<br>Unknowing who he was upon whose brow<br>Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,<br>The populous and the powerful was a lump,<br>Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless- <br>A lump of death-a chaos of hard clay.<br>The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,<br>And nothing stirred within their silent depths;<br>Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,<br>And their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropped<br>They slept on the abyss without a surge- <br>The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,<br>The Moon, their mistress, had expired before;<br>The winds were withered in the stagnant air,<br>And the clouds perished! Darkness had no need<br>Of aid from them-She was the Universe!"
