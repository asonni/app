B. Yeats<br> <br> Never give all the heart, for love<br> Will hardly seem worth thinking of<br> To passionate women if it seem<br> Certain, and they never dream<br> That it fades out from kiss to kiss;<br> For everything that's lovely is<br> But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.<br> O never give the heart outright,<br> For they, for all smooth lips can say,<br> Have given their hearts up to the play.<br> And who could play it well enough<br> If deaf and dumb and blind with love?<br> He that made this knows all the cost,<br> For he gave all his heart and lost.</p><br>THAT is no country for old men. The young<br> In one another's arms, birds in the trees<br> - Those dying generations - at their song,<br> The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,<br> Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br> Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br> Caught in that sensual music all neglect<br> Monuments of unageing intellect.<br> <br> An aged man is but a paltry thing,<br> A tattered coat upon a stick, unless<br> Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing<br> For every tatter in its mortal dress,<br> Nor is there singing school but studying<br> Monuments of its own magnificence;<br> And therefore I have sailed the seas and come<br> To the holy city of Byzantium.<br> <br> O sages standing in God's holy fire<br> As in the gold mosaic of a wall,<br> Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,<br> And be the singing-masters of my soul.<br> Consume my heart away; sick with desire<br> And fastened to a dying animal<br> It knows not what it is; and gather me<br> Into the artifice of eternity.<br> <br> Once out of nature I shall never take<br> My bodily form from any natural thing,<br> But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make<br> Of hammered gold and gold enamelling<br> To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;<br> Or set upon a golden bough to sing<br> To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br> Of what is past, or passing, or to come.</p><br>I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,<br> And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;<br> Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,<br> And live alone in the bee-loud glade.<br> <br> And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,<br> Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;<br> There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,<br> And evening full of the linnet's wings.<br> <br> I will arise and go now, for always night and day<br> I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;<br> While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray,<br> I hear it in the deep heart's core.</p><br>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br> The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br> Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br> The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br> The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br> Are full of passionate intensity.<br> <br> Surely some revelation is at hand;<br> Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br> The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br> When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br> Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br> A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br> A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, <br> Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br> Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br> The darkness drops again; but now I know<br> That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br> Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br> And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br> Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p><br>When you are old and grey and full of sleep,<br> And nodding by the fire, take down this book,<br> And slowly read, and dream of the soft look<br> Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;<br> <br> How many loved your moments of glad grace,<br> And loved your beauty with love false or true,<br> But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,<br> And loved the sorrows of your changing face;<br> <br> And bending down beside the glowing bars,<br> Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled<br> And paced upon the mountains overhead<br> And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</p>"}
