				"main_text": "Between my finger and my thumb<br> The squat pin rest; snug as a gun.<br><br> Under my window, a clean rasping sound<br> When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:<br> My father, digging. I look down<br><br> Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds<br> Bends low, comes up twenty years away<br> Stooping in rhythm through potato drills<br> Where he was digging.<br><br> The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft<br> Against the inside knee was levered firmly.<br> He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep<br> To scatter new potatoes that we picked,<br> Loving their cool hardness in our hands.<br><br> By God, the old man could handle a spade.<br> Just like his old man.<br><br> My grandfather cut more turf in a day<br> Than any other man on Toner's bog.<br> Once I carried him milk in a bottle<br> Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up<br> To drink it, then fell to right away<br> Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods<br> Over his shoulder, going down and down<br> For the good turf. Digging.<br><br> The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap<br> Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge<br> Through living roots awaken in my head.<br> But I've no spade to follow men like them.<br><br> Between my finger and my thumb<br> The squat pen rests.<br> I'll dig with it."
