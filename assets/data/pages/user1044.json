Tragical?<br><br> No. You preferred it to the usual thing:<br><br> One dull man, dulling and uxorious,<br><br> One average mind- with one thought less, each year.<br><br> Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit<br><br> Hours, where something might have floated up.<br><br> And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.<br><br> You are a person of some interest, one comes to you<br><br> And takes strange gain away:<br><br> Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion;<br><br> Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two,<br><br> Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else<br><br> That might prove useful and yet never proves,<br><br> That never fits a corner or shows use,<br><br> Or finds its hour upon the loom of days:<br><br> The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work;<br><br> Idols and ambergris and rare inlays,<br><br> These are your riches, your great store; and yet<br><br> For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things,<br><br> Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff:<br><br> In the slow float of differing light and deep,<br><br> No! there is nothing! In the whole and all,<br><br> Nothing that's quite your own.<br><br> Yet this is you.",
