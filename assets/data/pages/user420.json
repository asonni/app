				"main_text": "Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!<br> There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,<br> But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.<br> These laid the world away; poured out the red<br> Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be<br> Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,<br> That men call age; and those who would have been,<br> Their sons, they gave, their immortality.<br> Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,<br> Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.<br> Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,<br> And paid his subjects with a royal wage;<br> And Nobleness walks in our ways again;<br> And we have come into our heritage."
