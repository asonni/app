Then her face was bowed.<br><br><br><br> Quietly the Brother Officer went out.<br><br> He'd told the poor old dear some gallant lies<br><br> That she would nourish all her days, no doubt.<br><br> For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes<br><br> Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,<br><br> Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy.<br><br><br><br> He thought how 'Jack', cold-footed, useless swine,<br><br> Had panicked down the trench that night the mine<br><br> Went up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried <br><br> To get sent home, and how, at last, he died,<br><br> Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care <br><br> Except that lonely woman with white hair.",
