				"main_text": "You love us when we're heroes, home on leave, <br> Or wounded in a mentionable place. <br> You worship decorations; you believe <br> That chivalry redeems the war's disgrace. <br> You make us shells. You listen with delight, <br> By tales of dirt and danger fondly thrilled. <br> You crown our distant ardours while we fight, <br> And mourn our laurelled memories when we're killed. <br> You can't believe that British troops 'retire' <br> When hell's last horror breaks them, and they run, <br> Trampling the terrible corpses--blind with blood. <br> O German mother dreaming by the fire, <br> While you are knitting socks to send your son <br> His face is trodden deeper in the mud."
