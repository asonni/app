But where I say<br><br> Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament<br><br> Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent<br><br> To dearest him that lives alas! away.<br><br><br><br> I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decrees<br><br> Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;<br><br> Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse.<br><br><br><br> Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see<br><br> The lost are like this, and their scourge to be<br><br> As I am mine, their sweating selves, but worse.",
