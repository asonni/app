Near them on the sand,<br> Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown<br> And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br> Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,<br> The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.<br> And on the pedestal these words appear:<br> 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'<br> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br> The lone and level sands stretch far away."
