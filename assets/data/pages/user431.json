				"main_text": "Why do you lie with your legs ungainly huddled,<br> And one arm bent across your sullen, cold,<br> Exhausted face? It hurts my heart to watch you,<br> Deep-shadowed from the candle's guttering gold;<br> And you wonder why I shake you by the shoulder;<br> Drowsy, you mumble and sigh and turn your head . . . .<br> You are too young to fall asleep for ever;<br> And when you sleep you remind me of the dead."
